    "title": "A Monster in Tokyo…",
    "article": "It happened one evening in May, 53 years ago, in 1947. Many people in Tokyo had switched on to the American Armed Forces Radio Station. It was two years since the Second World War had ended and Japan had been defeated. But the Americans were still around. And so was their radio station.Around 7 pm, the radio programme was interrupted. An announcer screamed that a huge sea monster had risen from the sea.A Monster in Tokyo… It was more than 20 feet long. Having waded ashore, it was scaring the wits out of people. And it had been seen in the stretch between Tokyo and Yokahama. Like the TV news channels tell us to “stay tuned for further news,” the radio announcer did the same. Fear could be heard in his voice.The news kept getting worse and worse with every five-minute bulletin. The monster was heading straight for the Japanese capital, Tokyo. The armed forces of the United States were asked to keep off the streets. A train had been derailed by the nasty monster, and some people had been hurt.The news spread like wild fire in Tokyo. There was total panic among people, and even among the American armed forces. One senior army officer left a dinner party midway, filled up three trucks full of soldiers and went off to fight the monster.At 8 pm there was a final announcement from the radio station. The news of the sea monster was a practical joke, the announcer said. The radio station had wanted to celebrate its fifth anniversary in a new manner. It had been their idea of a joke.",

    "title": "A Sojourn in Venice",
    "article": "Venice is one of Italy’s major seaports, and capital of the province of Venezia in northern Italy. It was the greatest seaport in late medieval Europe and Europe’s commercial and cultural link with Asia. It is also one of the world’s oldest tourist and cultural centres. Aditi De writes of her visit to this most romantic of cities.Venice is such a strange city. It is built on an Italian lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. It has canals instead of roads, which means there are no cars or buses, no trams or trains or bicycles whizzing past us. Best of all, we could walk or jump or play hide-and-seek on its cobbled streets or its countless bridges whenever we chose to.Daily life in Venice skims over its waterways, especially the sweeping double curve of the Grand Canal and the 180 smaller water passages that run through the 118 islands that make up the city.As we stop by a bridge over the canal for a minute, we spot blue ambulance boats weaving past red fireboats and police patrol boats. It made us stop for a minute to rethink. Weren’t these in place of the Red Cross ambulances, red fire engines and blue police vans we knew in other cities? Of course.But then, Venice is ruled by the lagoon it is built on. Leaning over the railings of St. Marcos Square in the city’s heart, we realise this as grey boats tow away the garbage, bright soft drink and ice-cream barges hawk their wares, and tooting tug boats guide huge ocean liners into Venice harbour.Just then, we spot what’s typical of Venice – a gondola! We hop into a gondola to be ferried from one canal bank to another, a ferry service known as traghetto, for 1,000 Italian lire (about Rs. 20). This typically Venetian watercraft, with gondoliers or boatmen in striped jumpers over black trousers with jaunty berets on their heads, now number only about 400. In the 16th century, there were 10,000 gondolas on the canals.For generations, tiny boatyards have built these lop-sided boats, with one side curving further outwards than the other. Why, we wonder? To balance the weight of the oarsman at the stern.All day long, we walk through the 3000-odd solid streets or passageways that dot the ten main islands apart from the mother city of Venice. We discover that Venice’s historic centre is built upon an archipelago or islets and mud banks that are just two miles long and a mile across. We stumble upon an amazing fact – that the house numbers in this unusual city run by the district, going up streets, through alleys and over canals.A Venetian friend tells us that Italians call the city Venezia, or La Serenissima, the Serene City. Venice was originally built on piles of stones dropped into the lagoon, over which planks of wood were laid. Of course, the bricks of the grand mansions on the canal often felt damp to the touch.That’s easy to believe when we hear about the aqua alta or high water. Caused by either spring tides atop the lagoon or an underground movement of the Italian peninsula, high water often causes the beautiful squares around Venice’s churches to turn into lakes, the roads into gushing rivers.That doesn’t however, stop Venetians from putting on their raincoats and gumboots, and going to school. For the government provides wooden platforms all over the city that are used as step ways to survive the aqua alta.This Italian city is known for its festivals, especially the popular ten-day Carnival in April. Children, teenagers and adults dress in freaky costumes, weird stockings and shoes, then don masks before they take part in this celebration. It’s difficult to make out who is behind each mask, but it’s easy to make friends during this constant party in the streets. What fun!On other occasions, Venetians celebrate with a regatta or boat race. The city loves the Vogalonga, on the first Sunday of May, best of all. That’s when anyone who can row with oars is welcome to join the other boats on the great Grand Canal, especially in fancy dress. Imagine the sight!Venice is an unusual city, but an equally unusual threat looms over it right now. It’s sinking. Since it’s built on a lagoon, the weight of the city on the silt beneath it threatens its very life. “Venice today is sinking three times as fast as before, at 300 mm per century,” explains an environmentalist.We shudder at the thought of beautiful Venice, with its stunning churches, its collections of art and its happy spirit, buried under the Adriatic. May the winged Lion of St. Mark, the symbol of Venice, never face that day.",

    "title": "Abdul Kareem's Forest",
    "article": "A lush green forest in the middle of a rocky wasteland. No, this paradise is not an illusion. Abdul Kareem has created it with his own hands.Kareem’s 30-acre forest is in Kasargode district, Kerala. It is home to 1,500 medicinal plants, 2,000 varieties of trees, rare birds, animals and insects. Agricultural scientist, MS Swaminathan, has called the forest a “wonderful example of the power harmony with nature.”So, how did Kareem manage to convert a wasteland into a forest?Let us go back 24 years, to 1977, when Kareem purchased a five-acre rocky wasteland. Kareem was an airlines ticketing agent with a craze for the woods. Though he never went to college, he could talk about the properties of plants and trees like an expert botanist, reportsThe Hindustan Times.Kareem dug a huge well and began to toil in the rocky, arid terrain. In the beginning, people thought he was crazy to waste his time and money on wasteland. But, Kareem has ‘green fingers’ (a term used for people who love nature). Soon, he began investing more and more of his savings to add land and amenities.Today, the ‘wasteland’ is the haven of nature-lovers – from students wanting to explore the woods, to agricultural scientists. Kareem has been honoured by several organisations, including the United Nations, for his work.He just let his forest grow naturally, without insecticides or fertilisers. He believed in the ability of nature to replenish itself without the interference of humans. That’s why he does not allow fallen leaves or twigs from the forest to be removed.Recently, Kareem even refused an offer by a well-known resort to launch an Ayurveda (ancient Hindu practice of holistic medicine) centre in the forest.“I wanted to spread the message that if trees, animals and birds survive, only then human beings have a future,” Kareem said in an interview.Shouldn’t we be listening?",

    "title": "Alpana",
    "article": "Thousands of years ago when humans did not know how to read and write he communicated by means of drawing pictures. The walls of caves where early man lived, whether it was in India or France, have been found to be full with primitive drawings. The art of alpana, practised by Indian women for centuries, is one such form of visual expression.Alpana has different names in different parts of India. In Bengal, it is Alpana, it is Kolam in south India, Rangoli in Maharashtra, Osa in Orissa, Aripana in Bihar, Sonarakha in Uttar Pradesh, Sathiya in Gujarat, Aripona in other regions of north India and Apna in western Himalayas.The art of creating various kinds of wall and floor patterns, Alpana patterns are mostly made by the women. These patterns are usually geometric or floral in nature. They are made from a variety of materials like coloured dals, rice, wheat, dyed sawdust, and colours.During Lakshmi puja in November, special alpanas of a pair of pretty feet are drawn, outside the homes of people. The feet belong to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and are meant to ensure prosperity to people.In spring, before the sowing of the seed, a tender green colour is used to draw the alpana. In autumn when the seeds mature, it is drawn in vibrant yellow and in winter at the time of harvesting, it is drawn in the brown-gold of the leaves of autumn. An important feature of the alpana is that the entire design should be an unbroken line. It is believed that gaps provide an entrance for evil spirits.Decorating the floor in different parts of the house is believed to be a good omen. The entrance decoration is a gesture of welcome. For over 3000 years, the women of Mithila have drawn wall and floor paintings to avert natural disasters, protect their crop, and pray for the well being of their husband and children.In Rome however, people painted their walls for a totally different reason. There were very few windows in their houses, so in order to decorate the empty walls they painted frescos. The artist applied a thin layer of plaster on the wall and then directly painted on the wet plaster.The ceilings and walls of the world famous Sistine Chapel, one of Rome’s most enduring landmarks, are covered in frescos that depict stories from the Bible. Michelangelo painted them in the 16th century.In India most tribal paintings were made on the mud walls of huts, terracotta figures, wooden sculpture and occasionally on leather, all materials that deteriorate fast. In fact most wall paintings were expected to disappear within a season so that another painting depicting a new season could be drawn. Floor patterns on the other hand were made daily to depict the beginning of a new day.Of all the wall and floor painters of India, the women of Madhubani are the most celebrated. They cover the wall with a coat of natural colour usually made with cow dung. Then they dip their finger in a rice paste to draw the patterns. They mostly draw scenes from the epics as well as local tales.In fact the notion of paintings on canvases that are displayed on the walls of art museums is a relatively modern one. They date from the time when a price began to be attached to this art form. The earliest paintings have always been made on walls and floors and ceilings, and they connected in a much more immediate way with people than many present day masterpieces on canvas.",

    "title": "Aristotle can't remain Ignorant!",
    "article": "The Greeks were a passionately curious lot. When Alexander the Great set off in 334 BC on the famous expedition that took him over the Hindukush into Tashkent and Kashmir, he was accompanied not only by navigators, guides and surveyors, but historians and philosophers as well.Alexander had been taught by the philosopher Aristotle, and we are told that he ordered everyone throughout Greece and Asia who made their living by hunting, fowling, fishing, beekeeping and so on, to make sure that “Aristotle should not remain ignorant of any animal born anywhere.”So when Aristotle discusses elephants, it is the diet, digestive organs, teeth, age of maturity, and length of pregnancy of the Indian elephant that he is talking about, not the African variety.Aristotle himself argues in one of his most stirring passages that everything is worth investigating, however lowly. “We should not childishly complain against the enquiry into less worthy animals; for in everything natural there is something marvellous. We should approach the study of every animal without shame; for in all of them there is something natural and beautiful.”Aristotle the great greek philosopherAristotle firmly believed that we have a duty to know. That is what humans are there for, and that the spirit of enquiry is what leads them to happiness. He was convinced it is the closest that humans can come to being immortal.More about AristotleBorn at Stagira in Macedonia, Aristotle was one of the most influential philosophers of ancient Greece (the city state of Macedonia was under the rule of Athens, the towering symbol of Greek civilisation).He was the star disciple of the renowned philosopher, Plato, who studied under the great teacher, Socrates. At 17, Aristotle joined Plato’s academy in Athens, and remained there until the philosopher’s death.Between 343 and 340 BC, Aristotle tutored the young Macedonian, Alexander, later known as a great conqueror. In 335 BC he returned to Athens where he founded a school, the Lyceum.Here he organised and carried out research on many subjects, and built a great library in the belief that it was necessary for humans to probe every aspect of the world around them. On the death of Alexander, in 325 BC, anti-Macedonian feeling in Athens caused Aristotle to retire to Chalcis, where he died, in 322 BC.From the Woodpecker volume 2000, brought out by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehra Dun, in north India. Creating environmentally sustainable technologies at the local level is its main concern.",

    "article": "‘My heart is beating, keeps on repeating. . .’ remember the memorable lines from the 1970s Hindi movie ‘Julie’? Remember the Satyajit Ray directed film ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ in Bengali and the mischievous Merlin-like magician Borfi? The tale of two simple village boys Goopy the singer and Bagha the drummer, who by a curious turn of fate, find themselves in the possession of boons by kindly ghosts.Teeming with interesting, ‘other-worldly’ characters and the toothless Borfi in his pointy hat and glasses, a wizened creature who cast naughty spells on all and sundry. Including the king whom he put to sleep for years and years. No prizes for guessing who wrote the lyrics or who Borfi was. Borfi was none other than Harindranath Chattopadhyay!But it wasn’t only mischief that this versatile personality was famous for. Everyone adored him for his satire and wit. His satire was earmarked by his appearance as a curd seller in his shows, an instant sell out. Harindranath’s first love was the theatre. He also loved to travel. The combination was devastating.Harindranath was a jack of all trades and that too without formal training in any of them. Actor, poet, satirist, musician, singer and painter, Harindranath Chattopadhyay was a multi-faceted vibrant personality. In the year 2000, an exhibition of Harindranath’s vibrant and never-seen-before pictures was held at the Art Bazaar in Kidderpore in Calcutta. In fact close friends didn’t even know he painted!Perhaps that is why everything he did had a wonderful, childlike quality to it. His paintings, like the rooster for example, are striking. Many of these were made of crayons, with bright colours as if drawn by a restless, talented kid. His paintings reveal that Harindranath was well aware of the styles of modern artists.A free spirit, Harindranath hated the nine-to-five work routine. He was always the amateur and indulged in the arts without taking up any particular branch as a profession. He hosted shows abroad through which he showcased aspects of Indian life and culture. He would perform in them too. His most popular performance was as a curd seller. He would appear on stage carrying two vessels of curd, and recite catchy rhymes satirising day-to-day life or famous personalities. Audiences loved it and invariably after every performance would give him a standing ovation. He was invited abroad many times just to perform this show.He enjoyed life to the fullest. In fact when he wrote the lyrics for ‘Julie’ he was quite an old man. The song was entirely in English -the first Indian film song in English – and the film, a teenage love-story!Harindranath was the brother of the freedom fighter Sarojini Naidu who was also better known as the Nightingale of India. Born in a family of talented people, his father was Aghornath Chattopadhyay, who was the principal of Hyderabad Nizam College. Besides Sarojini, his brother Birendranath, assisted Lenin, the great Russian socialist. His other sister Mrinalini, was principal of a Women’s Training College!He was popular with women. “He was an attractive man, with sharp features,” recounts artist and close friend Paritosh Sen in ‘The Telegraph’.Harindranath died at the ripe old age of 93. But the world will not forget him in a hurry. His colourful personality has ensured that.",

    "title": "Banaras The Eternal City",
    "article": "City of many names, Banaras as it is most commonly called, was officially renamed in 1956 as Varanasi, a name from antiquity. It was first known as Kashi, the city of light, when it was the capital of the kingdom of the same name about 500 BC.For over 2000 years, Banaras the eternal city has been the religious capital of India. Built on the banks of sacred Ganga it is said to combine the virtues of all other places of pilgrimage and anyone who ends their earthly cycle here is said to be transported straight to heaven.Banaras was also celebrated as the place where the most profound wisdom dwelt, the seat of all enlightenment and learning. Its permanent advantages include the highest sanctity, fertile soil, and its location on a great river. Hindu rulers built great palaces, temples, and ghats in the city. It is also mentioned in late Vedic literature and in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The city encompasses Sarnath, where Buddha preached his first sermon in about 530 BC.From the 4th to the 6th century, Banaras was a great cultural centre, but the onset of Muslim occupation in 1193 resulted in the city’s decline and the destruction of its ancient temples. For nearly six centuries, the city was under Muslim rule. The first raid by Muslims, who sacked and plundered some Hindu temples, occurred about AD 1035. Banaras was finally conquered in 1194 when an Afghan general according to Muslim historians, destroyed nearly a thousand temples and carried off his booty on the back of 1,400 camels.Temples continued, however to be destroyed and rebuilt, with some emperors taking part in both activities at different times, until the last episode of destruction by Mughal emperor Aurangazeb in 1669.In the early years, say 1,000 BC, Kashi’s inland acres, behind the high bank of the river were known as the forest of bliss. There beside its ponds and lakes, under the trees, gurus, and their students, ascetics, meditators, scholars, and disciples made their hermitages, their classrooms.However the essence of the place is that it is a holy city, the most sacred place on the 1,560 mile course of the sacred Ganga river. And it is because of this fact that princes and conquerors, merchants and artisans came to it and left their mark on it. And it is why the pilgrims come. The allure of Banaras is great, for the Hindu who dies here attains moksha or liberation.Holiest of cities to Hindus and earthly abode of Lord Shiva, Banaras is a beacon for pilgrims who come to bathe in the sacred Ganga river. There are pandas ( brahmin priests) who wait by the ghats to assist pilgrims. For a small contribution, such men provide food and flowers for offerings and coach the uncertain in their prayers.There are two important paths that pilgrims usually take. One route starts at the Manikarnika Ghat with a ritual bath and devotions performed along the way south to the Panchkroshi road. The road makes a wide loop enclosing the sacred city, and ends on the north at the confluence of the Varuna river and the Ganga. Pilgrims make this journey on foot, starting well before daybreak, stopping at 108 ritual places of worship. The complete pilgrimage takes five days.The other pilgrimage path takes the devotees to the five tirthas. The first of these is at the Asi ghat where the pilgrim bathes and then follows the Ganga north (downstream) along the famous riverfront, making his offerings and prayers as he goes. As you walk northward from Asi the first important ghat you reach is Tulsi, named for the late 116th century poet Tulsidas, best known for making the great Sanskrit epic The Ramayana accessible to ordinary people in his Hindi version.Banaras contains more than 1,500 temples and mosques. Almost all of the city’s 5 km of river banks have been converted into ghats. Banaras on the whole has 100 bathing and burning ghats, of which Manikarnika ghat is the most sacred. This is the main burning ghat and one of the most auspicious places.Day and night the fires burn at Manikarnika ghat and the remains of the dead are scattered upon the river. To die in Banaras is to die blessed; many move here to live out their final days.The multitudes of pilgrims are among the largest source of revenue to the city. With a constant influx of visitors, Banaras is a haven for medicants – beggars who have quit their worldly pursuits.The best ghat to hang around is Dasaswamedh. Here you will find myriad people doing myriad things. You will see people bathing, excercising, pandas performing pujas and so on.Apart from the ghats lining the river, city’s other highlights includes a golden temple built in roofed quadrangle with stunning gilded towers and the Banaras Hindu University. BHU is one of the oldest and largest educational institutions and is one of India’s most prominent seats of learning. Founded in 1916 by the great nationalist and educator Pandit Madan Mohan Maliviya, BHU has a 1,300 acre campus on the outskirts of the city. Today one of the largest residential universities in India, it has schools of both the ancient Indian Ayurveda practice, colleges of engineering, agriculture, commerce, technology, music and fine arts, theology and oriental studies.It also has one of the finest museums the Bharat Kala Bhavan. There is even an astronomical observatory. The Arabic Centre of Islamic Studies is a reminder of the fact that more than 25 percent of the city’s population is Muslim.Centre for artisans as well as for the faithful, Banaras produces textile, apparel and carpets. Banaras’ weavers are well-known for their sarees in silk with gold and silver brocades. Jewellery, brasswork, lacquered toys are the other important handicraft products.",

    "title": "Batik: Ancient Art of Painting in Wax",
    "article": "A routine college day. We had to go for textile practicals after lunch. Going for any class post lunch was a pain. All we wanted to do was sleep. But, that remained a dream since we were always packed with classes after lunch. Lazily, I dragged myself to the textile laboratory.“Today we are going to learn the technique of batik but first let me brief you about it,” said the teacher.I was already bored. First theory and then the practical. What more could one ask for! Who wanted to know about a technique of dyeing with the strange name batik, anyway? Then I put aside these thoughts and decided to listen. After all, I would have to attempt it myself in a while.What followed took me by surprise. A most fascinating journey through different lands down the ages as the teacher unpeeled layer after layer of the beautiful secrets of batik.Close up of a Batik artist painting on a white cloth, IndonesiaThe art is believed to be more than a 1000 years old as evidence in the form of dyed fabric has been found in India, Egypt, China, Japan and Turkey. For a very long time, Indonesia has been recognised to be the seat of batik.The word batik itself is of Indonesian origin and means ‘wax writing’.An artist carefully traces the floral motif on a traditional batik fabric using melted waxNowadays, blocks made of copper are used to print patterns. These copper blocks or stamps are called ‘caps’ (pronounced as chops in Indonesian). They make the process faster. Each cap is made by twisting and bending a 1.5 centimetre copper strip in the shape of the pattern required. These are then soldered to another copper strip which is used as a handle.After the pattern is made, wax is applied to the areas where the colour is not needed. This is done using a small copper container with a long slender spout called canting. Canting is believed to be a purely Javanese invention. Melted wax is filled in the copper container and then applied to the cloth.While the artist is at work, he keeps a container full of melted wax constantly on the flame by his side. Generally, beeswax mixed with petrol-based paraffin wax is used.Assortment of colourful batik textile. Manamana / Shutterstock.comIn India the wax is applied with the help of a brush, mostly.After the application of the wax, the cloth is dipped into the desired colour. The portions that are covered with wax remain in their original form while the rest of the cloth gets dyed. The cloth is then immersed in cold water to harden the wax. It is finally left to dry. The process is repeated if more than one colour is used.After the dyeing is complete, the cloth is immersed in boiling water which melts the wax. It is then that the batik pattern surfaces.To get the marble paper effect, the wax is deliberately cracked before placing the cloth in the dye bath. The dye seeps into the tiny cracks and creates fine lines.The number of colours used indicate the number of times the cloth has been dyed. Traditionally, blue, brown and red colours were used in batik, but now several others are used as well. Batik fabrics are used to make anything and everything in India today – from shirts and tops to bedspreads, scarves, tablecloths&mldr;the themes vary from abstract paintings to mythological figures.By the time the teacher ended his lecture, I was sitting erect in class, and was very excited. I was impatient to put my own stamp of batik on a fabric. I did, too. How successful was I at it, you’d want to know? Well, that is another story.",

    "title": "Bidriware",
    "article": "_Pallo latke gori ko pallo latke…_The music of this famous Rajasthani folk song filled the air at the Crafts Museum in New Delhi where I went one Monday afternoon. Sitting in the verandah were rows of people who had displayed their work. What work it was too! My heart soared looking at all the things that they had crafted.It was all so beautiful that I could not help but talk to the artisans who had created them. That is when I met Shyamala, the bidri maker. She sat in a corner with the pallu of her sari over her head, fanning herself to get some relief from the searing heat. There was no customer with her at that time, so I took the opportunity for a little chitchat with her.After introducing myself I began asking Shyamala about the kind of work she did. She seemed a little bored at first. I told her that my purpose was to tell other children about this traditional art and explain to them how she creates such beautiful pieces. She was delighted on hearing that and began to talk to me in earnest.Bidri is the art of engraving and inlay, passed down to Indian craftsmen about 400 years ago from Persia. Though it is derived from Persian art, Bidri is an Indian innovation. The basic material used is an alloy of zinc in place of the copper used by the Persians. Bidri takes its name from its original home, Bidar a town in Karnataka. Lucknow, Purnea and Murshidabad are other important centres.The beauty of Bidriware lies in the striking contrast between the black base and metal inlaid. The whole process requires a lot of hard work. The metal inlaid is silver. However, the black base is not originally black. Initially it is cast with an alloy of zinc, copper and other metals, which do not react with iron. Beautiful designs are engraved with a chisel. A silver wire is put in the grooves and polishing is done with a buffing machine.This product is then dipped into a solution, prepared from the soil of the fort of Bidar. This soil has special oxidising properties. It reacts with some metals. Silver is not affected by this magic soil treatment but zinc alloy turns shiny black. This contrast of silver and black makes the articles look beautiful and shiny.Shyamala works eight to nine hours a day along with her children and grandchildren. Depending on the kind of workmanship, the number of articles varies. “Yeh kaam hamare khandaan mein bahut pehle se chala aa raha hai ,” (This work has been going on in our family for a long time now) she said.Her mode of earning is purely through the exhibitions and fairs, which she visits. When she gets a letter from an organisation inviting her to participate in the fair it has organised, she packs her pitara (treasure chest) and sets off. “Ghar ki yaad to aati hai par kya kare, kaam to karna hi hai,” she says (I miss home but what can I do, I have to work).Although the money derived from the sale of bidriware is not much, Shyamala will not think of an alternative means of livelihood. She is happy to be continuing the family tradition.Tired after a month of staying in another town, among new people, Shyamala waits to get back to her home. She will spend time with her family, making new and beautiful bidri articles and there await another letter.",

    "title": "Boomerang: From Weapon to Fun",
    "article": "This goes back a long time. The aborigines, or the original inhabitants of Australia, needed an effective weapon to hunt animals and birds for food. When they looked around, their eyes rested on wood, which was so easily available. They made banana-shaped weapons of hard wood, with a curve on top and a flat bottom. That made each leg act like an aircraft wing.They held it from one end over their shoulders and threw it hard and straight with such force that even animals could be killed. Thus was the boomerang born.In time, the aboriginals discovered that this little stick could be quite exciting. For instance, they discovered that if thrown in a particular manner, the boomerang curved in flight, did some neat spins in the air and returned to the thrower. They also found out that a wooden piece shaped like a T or V curves in flight. What they needed to make sure was that each leg of the boomerang was curved on top and had a flat bottom.Throwing boomerangs, thus, became a sport with the aboriginals. That is the reason why the old hunting weapon has been transformed into a popular sport today.The length of a boomerang varies between 12 to 30 inches and weighs about 340 grams. It has been noticed that a returning boomerang thrown by an expert thrower can travel as fast as about 100 km per hour. It creates a circle almost 45 metres wide and completes almost 10 delicate spins and loops in the air, like airplanes performing difficult stunts at an air show. And then, the boomerang returns to the thrower.That is why the word boomerang in the English language is used to mean an action or statement that backfires.",

    "article": "Standing on the edge of a platform looking 150 feet straight down at the river below I thought to myself, how did I get roped into this mess? Do I really want to go ahead with this foolishness? Shouldn’t I be back with my feet firmly planted on the ground?I was standing on the platform of a 100-ft high bridge. My fingers tightly holding the rails in a death grip. I was about to do a bungee jump because I had boasted to Himakar, my cousin, I could do anything he could. At that time didn’t take into account such craziness. Then I was full of false courage and so I let my cousin arrange for this jump on a lazy Sunday morning. He had fixed it with a local sports operator.I have done many stupid things in life but I didn’t expect this particular foolishness to scare me as much as it did now. Taking this swan dive off this platform with just a largish rubber band tied to my body can only be termed a madcap and Xtreme sport. Also the 90 ft drop seemed like 900 metres from here! Where’s my momma?But before the day dawned, I was curious to know about this sport – bungee?? bungy? Was the difference only in the way the Americans spell it and how the rest of the world spells it? Well, not exactly but its one of the reasons.Actually there are two types of bungee jumping. Bungy, which originated in New Zealand and Australia, consists of rubber cords (with no elongation limitation) and it offers lower velocity and higher rebound but a smoother ride. While Bungee, the American variation, refers to the use of military-specification shock cords. Shock cords allow for a longer freefall but with a higher g-force, and greater hang-time on rebounds. Definitely not for the faint hearted.The actual origin of bungee jumping come from the ritual practiced by the “land divers” of the Bunlap tribe in Pentecost Island in the New Hebrides. Tradition has it a man called Tamalie, mistreated his wife. So she ran away and climbed a banyan tree. He followed her but she tied lianas or long creepers to her ankles. Just as Tamalie reached out to grab her, she jumped and he jumped too. The lianas saved her life, but he died.What excuse do I have right now, to back out? All my stupid friends were near by cheering me on. I dare not tell them my knees felt like jelly or that ankle straps make me feel like a convict with a leaden ball and chain attached. Suddenly the countdown begins. My heart pounds faster and faster...5..4..3..2..1.. heeeeellllllppppp! Before I knew it I was off the edge of the platform. Was it willing or with a friendly shove I didn’t know for sure. I realised for a micro second that I was floating in mid air before the earth’s gravity took over. I was plumming downward at 60+ miles.Unlucky for me, traveling at that speed on elastic bands is not yet outlawed! I stepped into space falling through a zone of pure animal fear. The next instant the river was zooming towards me at high speed. The wind was whipping my fear-stricken face as I plunged down towards the earth. I could feel the cords tug my harness. And then. . . I stopped just 5 feet short of the water. My hands lightly skimming the water.As I breathed a sigh of relief, the cord shot me upward at lightning speed. There was no snap in the elastic turnaround just a smooth, heavy slow-down, then swoosh. I cart-wheeled and took the second drop out of shape and out of control.I was busy trying to grasp the cord to hold on to something. As I tried to hold the cord, it viciously smacked me in the forehead and my bottom. I got busy fending off the cord and did exactly what I’d been told not to. When the thrashing finally stopped, I hugged the bungee and thanked my stars. I was safe a few feet away from the water.Bungee is a certified sport. Bungee operators offer jumps from cranes, balloons, helicopters, bridges, towers, platforms and the sport is growing from jump to jump. It is wise to check the operator’s experience for the equipment you will use and the type of jump you will do before doing it. Accidents are relatively always minor injuries such as skin burn, or getting slapped in the face or body by gripping the cord, which you are instructed not to do.It is a strange sport well appreciated by the public, safe and sound at a distance. Bungee jumpers take pleasure in diving off anything, much like a matador with only a red cape faces a mad bull cheered undoubtedly by a crowd safe above the barricades.As with all things American a zing has been added to this sport: ‘Slingshotting’ (from the ground up), ‘sandbagging’ (jumping with extra weight), ‘bodydipping’ (over water), etc. Other variations include jumping with your back to the ground. Jumpers admit that this is quite scary and it takes greater effort to let your hand go off the rail. When you can see what you are jumping into you can convince yourself into a jump.Whatever your own preference just keep telling yourself it is fun and RELAX (which I didn’t do but which you should do) and you will have a great time. Now that I am a pro at it with one jump I am impatiently looking towards next Sunday for my second jump.",

    "article": "When man took the first steps on the moon, a camera captured the moment forever. Today those pictures are a part of history. And so is the camera that was used to shoot them. The Hasselblad camera.Celebrity CameraThe first space photographs were taken with Hasselblad cameras. One Hasselblad is still orbiting around the earth. It was dropped by an astronaut while on a space walk. Do you know that a few Hasselblads are also lying on the moon? They were left behind to save weight on the return trip from the moon.There’s something about the Hasselblad that makes news — almost as much as the events it shoots.It could be because it is one of the world’s most superior cameras. Photographs taken with a Hasselblad are of a very high quality. So the world’s most historic moments have been captured on the Hasselblad. And some ‘out-of-the-world’ moments too.The origin of this high-profile camera is as interesting as its experiences. To know how it originated, we have to go back in time to yet another historic moment.Celebrity Camera []It was the year 1939. Adolf Hitler’s Germany had just invaded Poland. Great Britain and France declared war on Germany. World War II had been sparked off. One day, a German Nazi plane was shot down for flying over Sweden. Although Sweden had not participated in the war, it was friendly with the Allies. And so, hostile to Germany. While digging into the wreckage of the aircraft, Swedish troops came across an aerial surveillance camera. It is a special kind of camera which enables a person to shoot pictures on the ground while being airborne. The crash of the German plane had not damaged the camera at all.Sweden needed such superior cameras to keep an eye on the movements of the Germans, who were hovering near Swedish territory after having invaded Sweden’s neighbours –Finland, Denmark and Norway. It turned to Victor Hasselblad, a well-known photographer, and asked him whether he could duplicate the camera.“I can make one better,” replied Hasselblad. He started work in a shed along with Ake Tranefors, a person who worked on machines. The result of their efforts was ready in 1940. The Hasselblad was born.The Hasselblad is world famous for being precise, sturdy and dependable. The first 240 cameras were made by hand. This was followed by a type called model Ska4 which had a square format. During the war, the Air Force Survey camera MK80 was produced. From 1948 to 1990, 22 new models were produced and in the 90s, 10 more new models appeared, according to a report in ‘The Deccan Herald’.But what about the man who gave the camera its name – Victor Hasselblad?He was born in 1906 to a wealthy business family. A shy boy, Victor took long hikes in the country and formed a great interest in birds. He took to photography in his early teens. Right from the first, he showed an interest in camera design. He studied camera and photography abroad. He had a special passion for bird photography. He wrote a book “Flyttfagelstrak” (The Migratory Bird Passages), which is read widely by bird lovers even today.During the years 1923 to 25, Victor worked in camera factories, learning all he could about various production aspects. When he returned to Sweden, he was well equipped with knowledge about his field. In 1933, he married Erna Nathhorst who was to back him fully on his project. He started the Victor Hasselblad AB, a camera manufacturing unit, in 1940. It has grown into a giant company today.Victor Hasselblad died in 1978. His legacy, the Hasselblad camera, lives on. And it still makes news.",

    "title": "Champion of a 2300-year-old game",
    "article": "It was a lazy summer afternoon, and the buffaloes had gone to sleep in the village pond, at Hassangarh, in Haryana. They had been given a vigorous rub by little Bhola and his gang of four, ranging from six to 10. All they wanted to do was doze.The creatures moved their ears slightly when the boys clambered onto their backs. Each one of them held a flower stamen as if he was holding a sword. But even during the fierce sword fight between the ‘warriors’, the animals did not stir.Tired of the game, the boys jumped to the shore. An idea struck Bhola and their eyes shone with pleasure. Down on their fours they went, looking for smoothened stones. And when they had collected a large treasure, they began their contest. Who could send the stones spinning over the water the farthest?I hung around curious to see who would be able to do it. It was my first visit to a friend’s village and I was determined not to miss out on anything.The biggest of the boys positioned himself with a smirk and looked around him, as if already expecting applause. Then he threw a stone with all his might.The stone rose high up and fell barely three metres ahead. The others rolled in the ground with glee. The participant retreated to the ‘stands’ (a green patch of grass) and suddenly discovered a pain in his shoulder.The others performed more or less like him and came back nursing shoulders that seemed to have come out of their sockets. Then it was Bhola’s turn. He was the youngest and the slimmest of them all. But he had a glint in his eye.He picked up a stone, held it flat in his fingers. Then he bent as low as possible and released the stone in a wide arc movement. The stone went spinning over the water. It even touched upon the small waves created by one of the buffaloes as she suddenly tossed around. The stone went beyond 10 metres.Bhola had become a hero. The others realised that he knew the right way to throw the stone, and that it did not need just brute strength.It was sheer coincidence that on my return I stumbled upon a book called The Mammoth Book of How It Happened, put together by a gentleman called Jon E Lewis, and published by Carroll & Graf Publishers, New York, 2000. In a fascinating manner, he has put together into one collection, eyewitness accounts of moments in history, both eventful and ordinary.And one such eyewitness account was of a game played by the children of Rome in 300 AD, about 2,300 years ago! The game they played was the one that Bhola and his friends, and children all over the world play to this day – ducks and drakes!The account was by a man called Minucius Felix who “saw a group of small boys vying with one another in a game of ducks and drakes.” How did he describe the game? “You choose a well-rounded shell from the shore – one that has been rubbed smooth by the pounding of the waves – and holding it horizontally in your fingers while stooping as low to the ground as you can get, you send it spinning across the water&mldr;”This happens because when the fast moving stone skims the surface of the water, the water behaves like a solid and bounces the stone off like a rubber ball.What should the stone do? According to Felix, it should either skim the surface of the sea or “shave the tops of the waves, only to resurface time and again”! Naturally, the boy whose stone went the longest distance and shaved the maximum wave tops was the winner!There are some things that never go out of fashion – and ducks and drakes seems to be one of them. Maybe I will tell Bhola about the children who played his game 2300 years ago. What will he say, I wonder&mldr;",

    "title": "Chess for Children: A Smart Move",
    "article": "When we think of chess we think of two adults sitting opposite each other, thinking of ways and means to outsmart the other. Many people feel it is a very difficult game. But do you know that most chess players and champions start very young?Viswanathan Anand, number two in the world, played his first chess game at the age of five. This was in 1974. Anand’s mother taught him the game and was his first opponent. In no time he came to be called the Lightning Kid. This was because he made his moves with such speed. In 1987, Anand won the world junior championship, in the Philippines. He was the first Asian ever to do so.Take the example of world champion Jose Raul Capablanca of Cuba. He was born in 1888 and picked up chess at the age of four by watching his father play. Capablanca Jr’s father was his first opponent. Similarly, Sammy Reshevsky of Poland also made his first moves on the chessboard at the age of four. By 1920, at the age of eight, he was busy touring the cities of Europe as the ‘wonder boy’ who could outplay adults.In India, the success of Viswanathan Anand has encouraged many youngsters to take to chess. Curly haired Koneru Humpy from the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh learnt chess at the age of six from her father. The youngster won the World under-10 Championship at Cannes, France, in 1997. In 2002, at the young age of 15 years, four months and 28 days, Humpy joined the select batch of world class chess masters, called Grandmaster or GM. Her inspiration? Judith Polgar of Hungary, who earned the title of Grandmaster in 1991 at the age of 15 years and four months.Chess for Children: A Smart MoveBut Humpy was not the youngest from India to become a Grandmaster. A little earlier, Pentyla Harikrishna, also from the same state as Humpy, had become a Grandmaster at the age of 15 years, three months and five days! Harikrishna learnt chess from his grandfather when he was five years old.But these young players have faced stiff competition from another ‘master’. Parimarjan Negi, from India’s capital Delhi, became the second youngest player in the world to get the title of Grandmaster in July 2006. He was 13 years, four months and 22 days old. Sergey Karajakin of Ukraine holds the record for the youngest player to become a Grandmaster. He was 12 years and seven months in 2002 when he achieved this feat! Clearly, these youngsters believe in the slogan ‘chess for children’ rather than only ‘chess for adults’.It is also true that not everyone who plays the sport becomes a champion. Yet, it is a fact that the world has become chess crazy, especially as far as chess for children is concerned. In India, the southern city of Chennai was for long called the chess capital of India. After all it produced champions like Viswanathan Anand, Manuel Aaron and V. Ravi Kumar. Today the craze has spread across the country. The number of chess clubs has increased, as well as the number of tournaments played through the year. In Russia and several other European countries, as well as in Canada, chess is part of the school curriculum.In fact this is one game that helps the player in many, many ways and not only on the chess board. To play better, it becomes necessary to read chess books. So no one will accuse you of not being interested in reading! You have to be able to keep scores, so your arithmetic gets strengthened. More importantly, you are the general of your army on the board and have to think carefully before making any move. Otherwise your opponent will corner your troops. For this you have to be able to think of various moves and choose the best possible move. Naturally, your thinking becomes faster and you learn to decide faster. Next time you have to choose between a present of books, roller skates or a play station, such decision making skills will benefit you! Lastly, you have to try your hardest to win, but that does not mean you hate your opponent. Remember, you have to shake hands with the other contestant before and after a game.So, don’t be put off chess by thinking it’s too ‘brainy’ for you. Put on your thinking cap and shout out loud: chess for children!",

    "article": "I live in a neighbourhood of Delhi which is full of children of all ages, shapes and sizes. In the evenings, the quiet of the place is shattered by the blood curdling cries of boys and girls let loose in the park. They play games that are certainly not for the fainthearted!Ishaan and Tarini are no different. This brother-sister pair is particularly mischievous. Eight year old Ishaan and 10-year-old Tarini are known for playing pranks on others. Placing chewing gum on a chair before someone sits on it is one example. Their idea of helping their mother in the kitchen is to put salt in the tea before offering it to a guest. Two months ago, they locked up their neighbour so they could climb his guava tree and raid as many fruits as possible. The list is long.But something happened to them two weeks ago. They woke up in the morning to find a big butterfly resting on the chord of the light bulb. It seemed all of nature’s colours had come to rest on the butterfly’s wings. The vermillion red of the setting sun, the shimmering yellow of the sunflower, flecks of green like a young blade of grass. Small dots of peacock blue. Ishaan and Tarini stood as if they had turned to stone. They had never seen anything so beautiful. Then, as if knowing it was being watched, the butterfly zoomed off.Both the children ran after it. They watched it zig-zag its way from one flower to another. They watched it flutter its wings in the air and then it disappeared. The butterfly’s colours made it possible for it to disappear in a garden that had flowers and leaves and trees of similar colours.Crafts kits for kids: Butterfly in the gardenThat evening both brother and sister did not go out to play. They kept talking to each other about the butterfly. Next morning they went out in the garden hoping to catch a glimpse of the beautiful creature. It was nowhere to be found. Suddenly they noticed that every flower and leaf had pearly dew drops on them. And then the sun rose in the horizon. A bright, blinding orb of orange and yellow. Ishaan and Tarini wondered how they could have missed such wonderful sights till now.During the drawing class that day, both Ishaan and Tarini sketched the butterfly in the garden. But somehow they found the colours did not have the brilliant shades of the butterfly or the sun, or the softness of the leaves and flowers in their garden. Back at home they tried to draw the garden again but felt it did not match up to what they had seen. They kept wondering how to get those very colours on paper.I knew how they felt. Many, many years ago, I too had fallen in love with nature. On a vacation to the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh I had seen hill after hill aflame with the palash tree, rightly called the flame of the forest. And on a visit to the hill station of Lansdowne, the sight of tender pink hedge roses had made me wonder how many colours existed in the world. Seeing my interest in nature my mother had bought a craft kit for me from a nearby shop. The kit consisted of coloured beads, threads, ribbons feathers and woodshavings. I had spent many satisfying afternoons making as many pictures of the sights I had seen. All I had to do was draw on paper and then stick the material in any colour combination I wanted. I knew Ishaan and Tarini would also love to have such a present.I did not have far to go. There was shop in the neighbourhood with a big banner across it – ‘Craft Kits for Kids’. I went right in and chose one of the biggest craft kits I could find.When Ishaan and Tarini opened their present their eyes widened in delight. ‘Look, didi, this bead has the same mix of colours we see in the morning sun,” Ishaan told Tarini excitedly. “Yes, and a mix of those threads will give us the butterfly’s colours if we plait them and stick them,” she said as happily.” My job was done.Next day I had a surprise visit. Ishaan and Tarini came in carrying a package. “Open it,” they said. I did so and found a breathtaking picture of a garden full of trees, flowers, a sun shining above and, you guessed it, a butterfly! “You see, each of the things we used has a different feel, and the same colour looks different in each material. We found every shade we wanted. Thank you,” they told me together.Now almost every house in our neighbourhood has been made sunny with a framed picture crafted by Ishaan and Tarini. Not only that, the neighbourhood shopkeeper now has a bigger banner across his shop – Craft Kits for Kids – meet a child artist every Sunday. Refreshments included.’ Isn’t that great?",

    "title": "Dancing to Glory",
    "article": "It was a children’s dance-drama festival with a difference. At New Delhi’s LTG Auditorium recently, a group of ‘disabled’ children left the audience spellbound with their natural, joyful performances. Some of the children could not hear, others could not see or had difficulty walking. And still others were grappling with mental challenges. But that was no dampener to their spirits as they performed to an appreciative audience of eager parents, teachers and children.Dancing to GloryThe Annual Inter School Dance-Drama Festival saw over 300 children from 20 schools all over Delhi, participate in the event. What was important was the manner in which all of them overcame their challenges to become performers with joyous abandon.The theme of the festival was seasons. Each school had to depict a particular season using dance, free movement or mime, but no dialogue. While some children danced to the chilly winds of winter, others rejoiced at the onset of spring. Still others did a delightful monsoon dance. The result was a perky, spontaneous performance by the children, which enthralled everyone present.Some of the young actors were so pleased with their own performance that they refused to leave the stage. They wanted to dance all over again!The schools participating were Aanchal, Model School, Kulachi Hansraj, Balwant Rai Mehta, Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan, Enabling Centre and the Special Wings of Shri Ram School and Sanskriti School, to name a few.A new aspect was added to the festival for the first time. It enabled children without disabilities and those with physical and mental disabilities to perform together. It was called the Integrated Group. Both groups worked together for weeks to come up with a beautiful dance-drama.So good were all the children, that it was difficult to spot the difference. They were seen for what they were – a group of friends working towards a common goal. The Shri Ram School and the Enabling Centre put up a dazzling performance in this category.The festival is now in its sixth year. It is organised annually by Very Special Arts India, a non governmental organisation (NGO) working with the disabled.The people who work in this NGO feel that creative arts are a very good way for people with mental and physical challenges to gain confidence.The idea is that no mental or physical challenge need limit the human potential to create. The NGO organises artistic events for children and adults to show their talents to the rest of society.And indeed, there wasn’t a trace of nervousness in the children who performed at the festival. There was a great eagerness to perform, for each child knew that it was his or her ability alone that was being judged. Many of the children went back with medals and trophies, but every child went back with something far more important. A big smile and a real sense of achievement.",

    "article": "Dia, an 80-year-old labourer of Indian origin, lives in the corner of a cotton field in the western province of Kanchanaburi, Thailand. His rundown shack contains very little besides a military medal and a few clothes. The medal is a remnant of Dia’s eventful, if tragic, past.It is a past that has included a stint at Myanmar (then Burma), as a prisoner captured by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II (1939 – 45). During this time he was made to work in the construction of a railway between Burma and Thailand.Railway of DeathDia has lived for years in obscurity in Thailand, doing menial jobs to support himself. But now he has been given a chance to tell his side of the story. A Japanese film-maker Hideki Nakamura, made a documentary on Dia and other prisoners of war who were involved in the construction of the railway. The documentary is called:Railway of Death: Those Left Behind.The documentary narrates the story of the Asian prisoners of the Japanese Imperial Army. These men had been captured while fighting for the Allies – countries like Britain that were their rulers as well. Japan was on the side of Germany and Italy.India, being a British colony, was naturally expected to fight on behalf of Britain. Many Indian soldiers and others were sent to various countries in Asia (the Far East), Africa and Europe, to aid the British war-effort. Dia was one among many.The documentary highlights the plight of prisoners such as Dia and the subsequent years of loneliness and misery that all of them faced at being left behind in a strange land.So brutalised is Dia due to the experiences of the war, that he is unable to speak today. Nakamura say it is because of his great loneliness and sorrow from being separated from home.“He kept nodding when I asked him about his work for the Japanese military,” says Nakamura in the report by Inter Press Service, published in ‘The Telegraph’.Dia’s gestures have convinced Nakamura that he must have worked on the long railway that was constructed between Thailand and Burma by the Japanese army.Weed PickerIn one scene in the film, Nakamura takes Dia to the railway site and watches as the old man suddenly starts to pick weeds. He picks the weeds for hours suggesting that he is doing it out of force of habit.Nakamura says this must have been Dia’s work at the site of construction of the railway for several years, till the end of World War II. Another moving scene shows Dia tracing with a finger his route through Burma to Thailand.Hollywood got there firstThe “death” railway was made famous by the Hollywood motion picture of 1957, ‘Bridge on The River Kwai’. The film featured the experiences of prisoners from the Allied forces who were used to build a 415-kilometre-long bridge.More than 60,000 Allied prisoners of war were reported to have worked on the railway. Of these 15,000 died, many of them succumbing to either malaria or harsh working conditions at the Japanese-run camps.Nakamura’s ViewpointBut Nakamura is of the view that many more men were brought from South and Southeast Asia and forced to work on the railway. He estimates the number to be around 100,000.“Apart from Dia, I met several Thai men who said they had to work for the Japanese army,” he says. “The reason I decided to film this documentary was to publicise their plight that is hardly known as compared to their western counterparts”.And that is why his attempt to narrate the stories of Dia and the others becomes doubly significant.",

    "title": "Don't Stop the Music, I Want to Dance",
    "article": "Joseph Templin or Joe is an American teenager who loves to dance. He knows how to do a moonwalk, a swing, a twirl – all popular dance steps. The minute the music begins to flow, this lanky but handsome nineteen-year old, is all charged-up and itching to dance .Nothing is extraordinary about this except for one little fact. Joseph is profoundly deaf. Which means that he cannot hear a note of the music he dances to so beautifully.Still, something almost physical happens to him when music is played. He senses a change in the air’s energy when it comes. “The nothing is replaced by something,” Joe says to the LATWP Svc feature service, which wrote a report on him. The Times of India carried the report recently.It is this “something” that makes him such a good dancer. So good that he is all set to participate in a tough dance competition beginning late September, in Washington.Joe was a baby when he was struck by meningitis, a serious illness affecting children. The illness took his hearing. His poor family, living in Sao Paulo in Brazil, could not afford too many medications for him either. Then when he was three, Joe was adopted by an American couple, the Templins, and brought to Northern Virginia.Now, the Templins are an unusual family. They have adopted 11 of their 14 children, from countries as far away as Korea and Guatemala. The Templins believe that every one of their children is special. And that no handicap could hold a child back from doing what he wanted to. Joseph remembers the house ethos being simple: You will do everything that other kids do. Nothing can hold you back.Joe took this ethos to heart. As a child watching television, he liked to study the movements of dancers. Until one day he thought, I could try this myself. He started by mimicking the dance steps of pop star Michael Jackson. Followed by the dance-steps of other dancers. After a while he didn’t bother looking at the screen. He began to sense on his own what the next step would be.He obviously had that ‘something’, even then. That sixth sense which, coupled with nimble feet and good reflexes, makes him an absolute delight on the dance floor.None agrees with this more than Debra Sternberg, Joe’s dance partner. Debra, a dance instructor, was impressed by Joe’s natural flair and grace when she saw him dancing first. She hasn’t stopped being impressed. And that is why when the Virginia State Open swing dance competition was announced, she entered their names as partners.Joe is happy at this chance to display his dancing skills to a national audience. After the competition he intends to start going to college. He wants to take up a career in computer web design. Life is good, Joe feels. He only wishes that he can stop people from seeing him as the deaf boy who can dance. He only wants to be known as the boy who can dance.",

    "article": "I am writing this as I am travelling in my time machine. I know how important it is to keep a diary of happenings. The machine is making strange rattling noises, because I forgot to clean its aching joints this morning. It’s an old contraption, after all. Hullo! Where am I? I thought I was visiting ancient India, but this decidely looks like a pyramid. Oops! Looks like I have reached ancient Egypt. Never mind, as they say – enjoy!The clock in the time machine tells me that we have reached almost 7000 years back. We are walking down the street of Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt.A man with a belly, wearing a pleated skirt and a robe over it just passed by. He must be a wealthy man. So, even in ancient Egypt, it is pretty easy to make out who’s who and which part of society he or she belongs to. In contrast, see that man breaking stones, wearing a loin cloth.What’s this! Some women with elaborate hair-dos are wearing beaded dresses or pleated skirts with a long robe. They seem as if they belong to the upper class of Egyptian society.Dress like an EgyptianThe texture of their clothes is fine. It is linen, woven with yarn made from the flax plant. The higher up in society you go,the finer is the texture of the linen used – woven so finely that the cloth can even pass through a ring!The ones wearing plain short skirts are the slave girls. I don’t think I will be able to see the king and queen’s decorative ceremonial clothing, with feathers and sequins, as I have read somewhere. As they say, you can’t have everything.Their clothing style is chosen for comfort in the hot dry climate and children have a good way of keeping cool. They are running around naked to escape the heat in this blistering summer. The scorching sun is making me feel uncomfortable. I think I want to go back home now.Back from the pastI am back home safe and sound. No mistake this time. I have not landed in Mughal India, but in the power-less household of the 21st century. But there are a few facts I want to check. For instance, I want to know more about the women with elaborate hairstyles.Okay, so that’s it. My books and the Net tell me that just as for us today, hair was a major concern for the ancient Egyptians. Thousands of years ago, they were as anxious about thinning, balding and graying hair as we are today.Their paintings, specimens of combs, hairpins, wigs, and even poetry reveal their concern for hair today, gone tomorrow, and for looking good as per the standards of their times.Despite their obsession with thick and long hair, many men and women also preferred to shave their heads bald, replacing their natural hair with a wig. Wigs were popular amongst the upper and middle classes, the wealthier presumably maintaining a greater selection of wigs.Hair was also a popular place for ornaments and amulets; small fish, in particular, were attached to children’s hair, according to popular belief, for protection against the dangers of the river Nile.",

    "article": "“I did not see the face of my child: I passed into unconsciousness after her birth. My neighbours told me she was beautiful. My mother and the nurse buried her alive. I did not even hear her cry.\"A doll depicts a girl child and the words alongside it, movingly tells the tale of a new mother’s anguish at the brutal killing of her baby girl.The doll has been made by Belgian-born Francoise Bosteels, who made India her home over 25 years ago. Francoise’s dolls ‘speak’. They speak of the beauty of life and its celebration, but also of the injustice, anger and frustration of those in despair.The little shepherd boy bending to cuddle his lamb, the widow in a white sari, the fish worker who has no fish to give to her children – each of Francoise’s dolls have a story to tell. Each one brings a certain kind of Indian alive.The dolls are elegantly made and strike realistic poses. They are an expression of the dreams, hopes, discoveries, friendships, tears, protests and anger of their creator – Francoise. The ‘Deccan Herald’ wrote about her in an article.Francoise came to India in 1974 to help the sick in the villages of Tamil Nadu. A nun who is also a nurse by training, Francoise became involved in the social and health education programmes and in leprosy prevention and care. It was in India that Francoise made a serious foray into doll making with a Christmas crib. But she had become aware of her artistic side much earlier, at seventeen. Confined to bed for months due to an illness, she had made her first doll.In the course of her work in India, as she rode around the villages on her bicycle, she found that there was a lot to depict. There were many types of people – beggars, street children, landless labourers, widows, rape and dowry victims. All with varying reactions to situations around them.So Francoise began to make dolls that addressed the troublesome issues plaguing the lives of the people. The exploitation, the poverty, the hunger, but at the same time, the joys and hope, too.Francoise’s dolls are made of ordinary material. A variety of colourful cloth called feutre, strong paper ribbons, pipe cleaners, cotton balls for heads, wool, thread and discarded bobbins, silk and cotton cut-pieces, banana and coconut fibre, palm leaves, tamarind skin, bamboo, pieces of wood, small plastic boxes and bottles. Throwaway items that is recycled into beautiful pieces of art by the magical fingers of Francoise.She also uses gold and silver threads to make a variety of jewellery. The figures of the dolls are held together with the help of thread and gum.The dolls have one unusual feature – they are faceless. “That’s because these dolls could be anyone – from among the people that live around us. It could be me, you, us”, explains Francoise.Faceless or not, they have become famous. At a workshop in Philippines on Globalisation and its Impact on People’s Life, Francoise was invited to present these dolls to illustrate some of the issues that came up during the workshop. It was here that some women participants suggested that a book be published with pictures of these dolls and brief write ups to go with them.The dolls could help people understand such aspects of globalisation ( the process of moving towards a world in which people produce, distribute, sell, finance and invest without regard to national boundaries ), that tend to diminish the quality of life of people in poorer countries like India. So Francoise’s dolls are the subject of a beautifully brought out book ‘The Dolls Speak’, published by Better World Publications.Francoise’s dolls are stark portrayals of those living on the margins of society. They tell everything as it is. These dolls have the ability to ‘speak’ eloquently about things that would take a lifetime of words to understand.",

    "article": "Kaz Suyeishi will never forget the quiet peace of the cloudless August morning in 1945. The 18-year-old was in the front garden of her home in Hiroshima. She was chatting with a friend, when a gleam of silver in the sky caught her attention. “It looked like an angel,” she said. “It was the most beautiful airplane. It looked like heaven and peace.”From Heaven To Hell.The plane was ‘Enola Gay’, dropping the world’s first atomic bomb, nicknamed ‘Little Boy’, over the Japanese city, on August 6. “That little bomb changed heaven to hell,” recalled Suyeishi. The flash of silver disappeared, replaced by a white spot in the blue sky. The sky changed to gray. Then red. Then black. The next thing Suyeishi remembers is regaining consciousness under a mound of wreckage that had been her neighbour’s house. She is above 70.The atomic bomb killed 2,00,000 of Hiroshima’s estimated population of 3,50,000. And 1,40,000 of Nagasaki’s estimated population of 2,70,000 population was killed by the atomic bombing of August 9.Suyeishi, who suffered radiation sickness after the bombing, was one of the lucky ones. She lived. She dedicated the rest of her life to spreading the message of peace. “You can’t see the scars here,” she pointed at her face. “But I am scarred in here,” she said, tapping her chest. “I don’t want anybody to go through what I went through. I never want it to happen again.”A musician, Ryan Oba, was moved by Suyeishi’s story and composed a song about her watching the bomb drop. He called it ‘Little Girl and Little Boy’. “I couldn’t get it out of my head,” Oba said. “She was expecting to see beauty, and it was the Enola Gay.”“The sky was clearer than clear it should be. The crew had unlimited visibility. As if the heavens wanted everyone to see how great the anger of a ‘Little Boy’ could be.I wonder why it’s here? Can’t you see it Mother, coming near? Please carry me. Lift me higher up so I can see!The bay swings open. Now he’s away! Tell the folks back home a ‘Little Boy’ went out to play. No more war. There’s nothing to fight. All we’re seeing are a million points of light.Nothing but light, nothing but light&mldr;We’re nothing, nothing but light.",

    "article": "Ever played hopscotch as a kid? Hopped from square to square on one leg? Haven’t heard of it? Impossible! Hopscotch’s great fun. It’s a traditional game played by kids all over the world with many variations. I used to play it with other kids near my home. Okay, I’ll let you in on this game if you will tell me about some you played as kids.All hopscotch requires is a rectangular area, a piece of chalk and a flat stone chip. And it requires a couple of people to play it, of course!Do you have any open stretch near your house? Say about six feet by four feet? Well, take eight l-o-o-o-ng steps, turn left and take four steps. Do it again, till you come back to where you started. Mark this court with chalk. Now divide the court by first drawing a line through the centre into two halves. Cut these into eight equal squares. Each square will later become a castle.The squares can be numbered from one to eight in a sequence. The aim of the game is to capture these squares and mark it as a castle — as many as possible. The first player to capture the maximum number of castles wins.Now the game starts. The first player stands in front of the rectangle and throws the stone chip in the first square.He then stands on one leg and hops it from the other end. He has to complete a round of all the squares. Just before the square that has the stone chip, he has to lean over, without falling, pick up the chip and hop out!This exercise is repeated till a player has visited all the squares. To capture a square, the player turns his/her back to the court and tosses the stone chip over the head. If it falls within a square, the player can mark it as his castle.Other players cannot step on this castle. They have to hop over it.Now comes the interesting part. You are out if:You put your feet in the house or square you are trying to capture. You have to pick up the stone chip without touching it with your foot or resting your other hand on the ground for support.You put both your feet in one square. You can’t step on the boundary line or any of the lines.The stone must not touch any line and must fall within the square and in sequence. If it falls on a square already attempted or on a castle taken, you are out.If your other leg touches down or if you step on a castle, you are out.There are many variations and the design of the court can vary depending on the expertise of the players. In the end, the player owning the maximum number of castles wins the game.But if you think it is as easy as falling off a log, don’t be too hasty. Try it out. And if you fall flat on your face, remember, you are out!",

    "title": "How the Gorkhas Came to Dehradun",
    "article": "Some time ago, Madhu Gurung wrote about her grandmother who was the best storyteller in the world. Once ‘Bajai’ as she was called, told a different kind of a story – a real story of how the Gorkha warriors of Nepal came to settle down in Dehradun. Among them was Bajai’s grandfather, the chieftain of a clan.Bajai told us that more than 200 years ago, when the British East India Company ruled parts of India, they attacked Nepal. Bajai’s grandfather was the chieftain of a Gurung village called Gandrung. It lies at the foot of the fishtail mountain called Machapuchara. He and other chieftains from different parts of Nepal, joined under the command of General Amar Jung Thapa. They drove the British back. The British fled and the Nepalese army followed, conquering the whole of Kumaon and Garhwal hills.Unlike the well equipped British who had rifles and cannons, the Gorkhas fought with their traditional weapon, the khukuri. It is a knife with a short blade. But, unknown to most people, there is a cow hoof made at the base of the blade. One explanation for this could be that the Gorkhas are known as Gorakshaks or protectors of the cow. But the cow hoof at the bottom of the khukuri has another use as well. Because of it no blood ever falls or comes on to the handle of the weapon. The Gorkha’s grip remains strong as ever.It was with this weapon that the Gorkha army faced its opponents. The army consisted not just of men but women and children too. The whole family fought together.Having won Kumaon and the Garhwal hills, in northern India, the Gorkhas came to the valley of Dehra Dun (It now comes in the northern state of Uttaranchal). It was here, close to the natural springs of Sahastradhara (hundreds of natural springs) that they built a fort called Kalinga and ruled with an iron hand.The British still remembered their shameful defeat at the hands of the Gorkhas. They increased their numbers and surrounded the fort. But even then they could not find any way of causing harm to the Gorkha army.Finally, they found a way. They bribed a money lender with offers of land and income. He led them to the place from where the Gorkha army got its water.The British cut off all water supplies to the fort and starved the Gorkhas. On the fourth day, with not a drop of water to drink, the Gorkhas opened the gates of the fort and waited for the British troops. The first man, a British Major — was mowed down with a khukuri by a Gorkha woman carrying her baby in a sling on her back. By nightfall that day, not a single Gorkha adult survived. There were only a handful of children.The raw courage and fierce determination of the Gorkhas to fight in the face of all odds impressed the British. They were used to the easy submission of Indian kings. But for the Gorkhas, the traditional adage was “Kayar bhanda marnu ramro”- it’s better to die than to be a coward. They were determined to die than face capture.It was after this battle that the Treaty of Sagauli was signed, in 1816. The Gorkhas were recruited into the Army. The tales of valour was passed on from one generation to another.Bajai’s grandfather and grandmother did not survive the attack on the Kalinga fort. Bajai’s father was a young five-year old who grew up and joined the Army. He married a woman from the Kumaon hills. Bajai married when she was barely 15. Grandfather wasn’t rich but he loved the land of Johri. Every month, he put a little away and bought land with these savings. By the time he was a prisoner of war (POW) in Italy during the Second World War, in 1939, he owned nearly a hundred acres of forest, cultivated rice fields and gentle meadows with banana, mango and litchi trees.Bajai and Baaje (grandfather) had 13 children. Eight survived. They were determined to give their children the best. Baaje built a sloping tin-roofed house with his own hands. It had brown mud walls and floors, which Bajai loving washed with cow dung and mud every morning. Even in her bleakest hour when Baaje was a POW, Bajai insisted that the children go to school. She always insisted that we should pass at least 20 classes, which meant BA, MA everything. I do suspect she couldn’t count more than that&mldr;Baaje returned home alive, but with severe asthma. He died soon. Bajai never remarried, nor did she let her maternal relatives help a young widow and her seven children survive. Instead, she started tilling her land and growing her own foodgrains and vegetables. It was the same old Gorkha spirit at work.",

    "title": "Instrument with a Human Tone",
    "article": "A family of musicians in the city of Mysore, in Karnataka, has a unique family heirloom — a beautiful 300-year-old veena. The veena is India’s most ancient Indian stringed instrument.The veena is a poly chord instrument, that is, it is made of several strings. Each string produces a certain tone, which other strings cannot duplicate. Melody is produced when the strings are plucked.The Deccan Herald reports that the veena belongs to a family of well-known veena players or vainikas, as they are known. Veena maestro, Veene Shamanna, came from this family. Shamanna was one of the renowned musicians of the Mysore Royal Durbar or Court of the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore, over 300 years ago.In those days, it was the practice among royal durbars to patronise the best talent of the region. Their prestige and fame depended on their ability to attract talented artists.Durbars like those at Mysore were the hub of artistic and intellectual activity, and drew the finest musicians, artists and intellectuals of the period, to them.It was to be part of the charmed circle at Mysore, that Veene Shamanna’s grandfather, Lakshamana Bhagwata travelled from Thanjavur, in Tamil Nadu, in 1728. With him came his prized veena. He was appointed to teach the veena to the princess of the Wodeyar family.His son, Rama Bhagvata, was an expert in playing the instrument. Then came Veene Shamanna, who became musician-par-excellence in the court of the Wodeyar rulers. He credited a large part of his success to his veena, which by then, had acquired quite a reputation.Shamanna’s cousin Subramanya Iyer, was the author of the first book on veena in Kannada, ‘Sangeetha Samerasa’. He, too, played the fabled veena.Veene Shamanna’s instrument is one of the oldest in the country. The surprising thing is, it is still intact. The veena weighs about five kg. Despite having been used by so many people, notes played on the veena are as effective as before.Saraswati VeenaVeene Shamanna’s veena is an example of the famed Saraswati veena, the queen of all veenas. The Saraswati veena is very versatile and the most beautiful of all veenas. It holds a special place in Carnatic music, the classical music form of south India.The Saraswati veena’s present structure was developed at Thanjavur around the 17th century. The instrument is made entirely of wood.In Hindu mythology, the veena is known as the instrument of Goddess Saraswati, just as the flute is that of Lord Krishna. Saraswati is the Goddess of all muses and is known as the veena pustaka dharini or one who holds the divine source of sound and wisdom. That is why no picture, icon or poem of her is complete without the veena and the ‘pustaka’ or book, writes B.C. Deva in ‘Musical Instruments’.The myth of Saraswati and the veenaA story in the Vedas beautifully illustrates how Saraswati came to be associated with the veena. The gods and asuras (demons) were fighting over Saraswati or Vani (speech) as she was known for she represented the power of sound or speech. Each group wanted the power of her speech for the chanting of mantras in their ‘yagna’ or vedic sacrifice.But Vani ran away into the forests, and took away speech with her. She made the drum, flute and the stringed instrument or veena speak with her natural voice.Finally of course, she was convinced to return and serve the yagna as mantra. And that’s how the veena is said to possess a sound that is the closest to the human voice.Tracing the sound of veena to the hunting bowThe veena is the most ancient stringed instrument known in India. It enjoys a very superior position in the hierarchy of Indian musical instruments.The first mention of it occurs in the Rig Veda, the earliest example of a literary work in India. The Rig Veda is a compilation of 1028 hymns in homage of the Vedic gods, composed and memorised over 3000 years ago.The origins of the veena lie in bow-shaped harps. Did you know that the harp, in turn, traces its origins to the hunter’s bow?The twang of the bowstring probably gave early humans the idea of attaching a set of parallel strings to the same bow. They found that different notes could be obtained and the harp was born as a result of their efforts.Different kinds and different soundsThe veena has evolved over the centuries and there are many different types played. The ‘villadi vadyam’ found in Tamil Nadu and Kerala is one of the simplest.The Vedic veena known as the ‘maha’ or great veena, on the other hand, had 100 strings of spun grass and was played with two bamboo pieces!The SitarTo the followers of Indian classical music, especially the southern Carnatic music, the mention of veena brings to mind the name of musicians like Veena Balachandar and Chitti Babu, who revealed the genius of the instrument to music lovers.Today, however, the North Indian version of the veena, the sitar, is more popular. It is a long-necked lute, and could be the invention of 13th century Persian poet-musician, Amir-Khusrau.But the sitar was not considered a respectable Indian instrument till a century ago. Any outsider who wanted to learn the veena used be taught the sitar by traditional veena ustads (maestros). It was believed to be lowly enough for the learning of those not part of the ustad’s gharana or family.Now of course, the sitar is the wonder instrument from India. Renowned classical musicians like Pandit Ravi Shankar have brought the sitar centrestage in recitals within Indian and abroad.The veena, in contrast, seems to have entered a quieter phase. It is as if it is waiting for Saraswati to speak through it again.",

    "title": "Joining Hands for peace, at Hiroshima",
    "article": "Every year, on August 6 and 9, a peace memorial conference is held in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Thousands of people from all over the world gather there to indicate their support for peace in a world that is free of nuclear weapons. Dr Srimanjari, who teaches History at Miranda House, Delhi University, took part in one such conference, in 1998. She shares her experience, saying that the visit was a real eye-opener for her.How does one talk about peace? By sharing memories of pain with those who did not, over generations, so that the desire for peace become stronger. In the peace conference that Srimanjari attended, there were over ten thousand participants, who came from all walks of life.There were members of organisations working for peace or peace activists from over 30 countries, Japanese teachers, doctors, lawyers, students, and women who had brought their children along. And there were the hibakushas or atomic bomb survivors whose voices were the the most important, remembers Srimanjari.In quiet tones they spoke about the unimaginable changes that came in their lives after the atomic bomb blast: the unforgettable sight of people dying the most violent deaths all around, loss of family, a lifetime wait for members who remained untraceable, and an unending story of agonising illnesses, like cancer, caused by radiation, and most important, the realisation that they could never lead normal lives, says Srimanjari.A photographic exhibition at the conference venue showed the extent of human suffering at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, recalls Srimanjari. “There were photographs of people jumping into the river to save their lives after they were burned&mldr;. Mothers didn’t know where their children were after the bomb.”The history teacher remembers her visit to a hospital in Hiroshima. Most of thehibakushas were suffering from leukemia and respiratory diseases. Most of the men had Spermia – a disease in which the sperm count goes down. Many survivors were suffering from malnutrition and could not eat properly. But because of what they went through, the hibakushas were very active in the peace movement even though they were physically inactive.In 1998 there were about three lakh survivors (including the first and second generation survivors), and almost as many people had died earlier, says Srimanjari. The hibakusha have one demand: total abolition of nuclear weapons, and the strong belief that no one should ever suffer the way they have suffered.That is one reason why many hibakusha do not like the fact that the Japanese government continues to live under the defence umbrella of the United States of America, that is, Japan has allowed US warships to have a base in Japan, explains Srimanjari. (For, after Japan surrendered to the US in the Second World War, it was forbidden to have its own army. That’s the way it remains to this day.)The atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. From 1945 to 1954, Japan was under the occupation of US forces. In those years, there was very little mention of the condition of the hibakushas, and no organisation by the survivors to demand a ban on nuclear weapons. Nuclear tests were being carried out even then.But things changed in 1954, says Srimanjari. That year, many Japanese fishermen died in a hydrogen bomb test conducted in the Pacific Islands. The terrible facts of nuclear radiation came to light. For, till then, even the people of Japan had no real knowledge of what had happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The hibakushas had spent 10 years with hardly any help from the authorities.The Japanese government had not given any compensation to the bomb survivors. Mrs Matsui, who was among the people present at the conference, said that she had fought the cases of hibakushas for compensation, says Srimanjari.She remembers how one by one, many hibakushas came onto the stage and spoke about the untold losses that they have suffered due to the atomic bombing. “Those who were two years old when the bomb dropped could walk only when they were six years old and some of them were completely paralysed.”One of them said that it had been her dream to look beautiful and healthy. Would that wish ever come true, she asked. All of them spoke of how the bomb destroyed their childhood and youth. That there should be no more hibakushas in the times to come, was their one hope.Eveybody at the conference felt that there should be more interactions between people of different countries, says Srimanjari. They all felt that governments would follow if the people spoke out strongly for peace and against war. The hibakushas have travelled widely all over the world, including the US, to share their experiences with common people.Hundreds of schools, too, participated in the conference and that made all the difference. It also injected a feeling of hope, recalls Srimanjari. There were students from USA, UK, China, Pakistan and the Pacific Islands. The children had made beautiful paper cranes carrying the message of peace, and composed songs of peace. In the evening they organised peace marches.As in all such conferences, there was a peace signature campaign where everyone signed their names, expressing their desire for a nuclear-free world. Such peace meetings spread awareness, says Srimanjari. “How many people know that there are nuclear tests constantly carried out in the Pacific islands? A lot of people there have silently died as a result of radiation.”They all left the conference with renewed determination that “when we all join hands together our voices will be effective.”",

    "title": "Juneteenth: Celebrating End of Slavery in the United States of America",
    "article": "June + nineteenth => JuneteenthA holiday to celebrate the end of slavery and the freeing of slaves. Also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Liberation Day, and Emancipation DayJuneteenth (19th of June, 1865) is one of the most important days celebrated by the African American community in the United States of America. For it was on this day, 19th of June in the year 1865 that a majority of slaves were informed that they were free. However, they were informed two years after slavery was made illegal in the US.Slavery is the treatment of humans as private property of other humans and forcing them to work against their will. The early United States of America was built on the backs of slaves shipped from Africa. The cotton industry of the southern states benefited the most from slavery because it meant that landowners could get labor for little or no money.The first recorded African slave in the US was in 1526 and it took 330 years for slavery to be abolished in the country.In the presidential election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln supported banning slavery. After he won, the southern states rose up in protest and voted to leave the United States. Their economies were based on slavery and nearly half of their population were slaves. To remove slavery would radically change these states. The slave-owners were terrified that their positions of power would weaken. They left the United States and the country was torn apart leading to the Civil War (1861 to 1865). The northern states were now at war against their southern brothers.Map of United States of America: Areas covered by the Emancipation Proclamation are in red. Slave-holding areas not covered are in blue.Emancipation ProclamationLincoln was fighting to create one America. However, he could not decide everything for the states. The central government had the right to decide some things, the rest were decided by the states. At the time, slavery was a state issue. Lincoln had no legal footing to abolish slavery. He found an interesting workaround. The southern states were at war against the northern states. A president has broad powers during war time. Abolishing slavery would not only cripple the economy of the southern states but it would also allow Lincoln to turn the free slaves into a standing army in the south. This was the real motivation behind the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln was not fighting against slavery because he thought it was wrong. His home states in the north still had slavery. He fought against slavery to win the Civil War. Regardless, the Proclamation applied to 3.5 million out of 4 million slaves in the country.Abraham Lincoln issued a declaration called the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. It looked to end slavery once and for all. But the slaves were never told this. It took nearly two and a half years for Lincoln to win the Civil War and send his generals to the southern states to inform the slaves that they were free.The northern states were called the ‘Union’ and the states in rebellion were called the ‘Confederates’. After the Emancipation Proclamation, many Confederate states refused to obey it. As far as they were concerned the Union had no authority over them. Furthermore, Lincoln could not force them to listen because there were very few Union troops in the Confederate states. This was particularly true for Texas. It had the lowest Union presence and many slave owners fled to Texas with their slaves for security. This is why what happened there was so important.Juneteenth (19th of June, 1865)On the 19th of June, 1865, Union leader General Gordon Granger took control of the last revolting state, Texas. The state had nearly a quarter of a million slaves and the general informed them that they were free. This is why we celebrate Juneteenth on the 19th of June. It is important to remember that this was only for the Confederate states at war. The slaves in the Union states were freed several months later when the government passed the Thirteenth Amendment and universally ended slavery.Over the next 30 years, Juneteenth was widely celebrated. The celebrations were used to educate the former slaves on voting rights, wages, and various other important topics. The celebrations reduced in the 19th century because tough laws made it hard for former slaves to earn money. The older generations were busy working and the younger generations were busy at school. Many of the youth did not feel the same connection to the holiday since they only had stories to understand its importance. Texas became the only state to recognize Juneteenth as a statewide holiday. This helped in reviving the holiday. It is celebrated with sports, a barbecue meal, the singing of songs, readings of African American authors, and the drinking of strawberry soda.Today, Juneteenth has particular relevance. It is a symbol of how justice is always delayed for African Americans. The idea behind the Confederacy, states fighting for their rights to own slaves is not in the dustbin of history. There are still too many who believe in the idea of Confederacy without understanding what it stood for. African Americans still face serious oppression and violence by the state. Juneteenth is a reminder of the battle for the freedom and equality of the African American community, and the work that still lies ahead.",

In this letter to her mother, she tells us why she feels so.Dearest mother, you are the loveliest person in the whole world. You do anything and everything for me. Now this reminds me of the day when I had a fight with my friends.This happened when I was 10 years old. My friends and I were playing basketball when one of them teased another. The one who was teased was sensitive. She started crying.Letter from a Daughter to a Mother []This carried on for some time and soon took a violent turn. They pushed and pulled, scratched and screamed. As usual, I kept myself out of this for a while. But the tearful face of my friend made me react. This resulted in a break up with the otherfriend. I was very depressed because even the friend I supported did not show any interest in me. We had been friends for over two years and suddenly everything was lost in seconds. I went home crying and pushed the door open.Luckily, my mother was at home that day. When she heard the door, she came rushing from the kitchen. She asked me what had happened and I told her how I felt. After hearing everything, she hugged me and promised that everything would be all right. And would you believe it? All she told me to do was to talk to them or write out my feelings on a card .I did just that and things became better. That is my mother. She can make difficult things simple. She is always with me when things go wrong. Her love is such that lifts up my spirits. She lets me be the way I am. She is bright and sunny, free and natural.",

    "title": "Looking for sister in Hiroshima",
    "article": "August 6, 1945. The day the United States of America dropped the atomic bomb on Hirsohima city, killing more than 200,000 people. A day after which the world has never been the same, for it proved that humans’ capacity to inflict suffering on fellow human beings was infinite. A day that hundreds of thousands of survivors try to make sense of to this day, by trying to remember what happened at each moment that day, before and after the bomb fell.They hope that after hearing the story of their lives, people would say no to war. Noriko Ueda, a victim of the atomic bomb and war survivor, too, remembers that day. She was 14 years old.Looking for sister in HiroshimaLike many senior students, Noriko was not at school. Instead, she was working at a printing shop, to help out in the country’s war effort. Students had filled up the factories. Her 12-year-old sister had been sent with other students to clear some place that had been bombed a few days ago.The children carried two bags with them now: one was the lunch box, and the other was a first-aid kit for burns and bleeding. They had been trained to help those who got hurt during bomb attacks. On the morning of August 6, Noriko went to attend a meeting in a school compound near the factory where she worked. At that time, the bomb was dropped. The school was about 1.5 kilometres away from the epicentre.Everything was orange, recalls Noriko. She couldn’t hear anything at all. That’s all she can remember. “&mldr;But different people saw different colours. For me, it was all orange. For some of my friends, it was purple. So the reaction to the radiation of the bombing was different from one person to the other,” remembers Noriko.Luckily, the 14-year-old didn’t have any burn or any external scar. The school building and the toilet had acted as shield for her. Then she realised that half the building had been completely destroyed. When she went back to the factory next to the school, it was in a shambles.It was a horrible scene. There were people buried under the machines crying for help. Nobody had the slightest idea that an atomic bomb had been dropped but they could feel that it had been a bomb of great magnitude.Noriko ran back to the school where there were shelters. Many people who lived in that neighbourhood escaped because they took refuge there. Near the shelters a man was heard shouting, “Don’t get in. Those who are injured should get in first. Those who survived, don’t get in. Let the injured ones be looked after first in the shelter.”Soon black rain began to fall. “We and the other school children had been told not to wear white shirts because we could be more easily identified as human beings by the American bombers. We dyed our clothes from white to grey. The grey coloured clothes turned into black because of the black rain. Afterwards, we found that that black rain had lots of radiation and could cause harmful effects to our bodies,” says Norika recalling that frightful event.Graveyard in japanThen the school teachers told them what to do. “Please, from now on we are going to evacuate. Please go there to that mountain with utmost care not to get missed.” As they all walked together under the guidance of school teachers, towards that mountain, they could see hundreds or thousands of severely burned and injured people.They reached the bank of Ohata river, but could not cross because it was high tide and the water level was high. So they started to use their first aid kits. “Let’s help these injured people for the sake of injured people and for the country,” they told each other. Noriko feels proud today that she helped the severely burned and injured.Her 12-year-old sister, who had had been dispatched to clear up places that had been bombed, had gone missing. She never returned. Almost 220 students had been involved in the job. Most of them are still unaccounted for. They vanished. There were only about 40 seventh graders in Noriko’s group which was giving emergency assistance to the injured.They were told not to give water to the injured, especially to those who had got burnt. Drinking water could lead to death. But still they wanted water. They went down to the river to have some water and they died. Some were washed away to the sea nearby.Near the mountain there were some trees. Under the trees’ shadow there were people lying down. One of them was a young lady. Her face wasn’t hurt but her back was severely burned and her clothes were completely burned. They thought she could be a teacher in charge of first year students. At first she didn’t answer. After a while, she opened her eyes and said she was with the children and had tried to bring them as far away from the bomb-affected area. She then smiled and passed away.Ten days later, Noriko’s family was still looking for her younger sister. Her father went to a place where the children had been working, and there, from under the rubble they were able to pull out some blackened uniforms. They bore the emblem of her sister’s school. In some pockets were sheets of paper, meant for exams. The uniforms were donated to the Hiroshima peace museum.Noriko hopes that the young never see a war in their lives. “I would hope that, as they enjoy their spring holidays in the Peace Park, they remember that in this area, some of my dear friends lived and vanished instantaneously.”Today, Noriko is 70 years old and in the last stages of her life. But, she hopes against hope that, one day, her sister will return.",

    "title": "Madhubani Magic of Gangadevi",
    "article": "Aditi De of the ‘Women’s Feature Service’ writes about a meeting she had in the 1980s, with Gangadevi, the gifted painter of Mithila. Gangadevi is largely responsible for placing an ancient art, practiced for centuries by the women of her village, in the artistic map of the world.Face to face, Gangadevi, seemed shy at first glance. She drew the pallav (the border of the sari) of her brightly coloured cotton sari over her head, and pushed her black-rimmed spectacles firmly onto the bridge of her nose.Gangadevi had just returned to India after attending the Festival of India in the United States. Her mind was alive with all the strange scenes she had seen, the people she had met, and she needed to record all her experiences on paper. Gangadevi had just been honoured with a National Award for Crafts by the Indian government.Before our eyes, we watched America reborn through Gangadevi’s vision. She dipped her quill into a pot of black ink, and quickly put it to grainy, handmade paper. Black lines emerged as tall skyscrapers, with an upright rectangular shape within. What could it be? A lift, with a hat topped, shoe-clad man in it! Soon, we watched a long car, almost as long as the road whiz by. Women in knee-length skirts and men in checked shirts tucked into jeans, with young kids in tow, appeared on the scene through Gangadevi’s drawing.Gangadevi was born in the Mithila region of Bihar. She lived all her life in the region. What made her special was the unique gift she possessed – her magical fingers. Fingers, which drew absolutely spectacular line drawings of the myths and religious symbols of India.This gift is not unique to Gangadevi alone. For over three thousand years, women in the Mithila region have been painting such beautiful sketches.Maybe it has something to do with the historic value and beauty of Mithila. “Mithila,” Gangadevi revealed, “once stretched from the right bank of the Ganga to the foot of the Himalayas, one of the first kingdoms of eastern India. Both the Buddha and Mahavira, founders of Buddhism and Jainism respectively, were born in the Mithila region.”Most of the 30 million people who live in the Mithila region are farmers. The soil is fertile, and crops include wheat, rice, lentils and sugarcane. Early visitors loved its lush greenness so much that they called it Madhubani or the ‘forest of honey.’Gangadevi’s paintings too are referred to as Madhubani. Few things best portray the beauty, lushness and colour of the region, as her paintings.But why are women the painters here? It could be because Mithila is a matriarchal society, where daughters inherit the property from their mothers. The social conventions that bind girls in other parts of India from expressing themselves, do not apply here. Though poor, the girls of Mithila are encouraged to paint freely.Gangadevi remembers that her mother handed her first brush to her when she was still a child. It was a piece of rice straw and a few threads drawn from the hem of her sari. For ink, she used soot scraped from the bottom of a cooking pot, or from the chimney of a hurricane lantern.Like her cousin sisters and aunts, their mothers and grandmothers, Gangadevi learnt to mix the soot with cattle urine or gum arabic dissolved in water, or sometimes even goat’s milk. Since they didn’t have enough paper in the village, pages from her school notebook were often glued onto cloth to give her a large canvas to practice on.But usually, the women of Mithila painted on the walls of their homes, made of mud applied to a framework of branches. Their villages, some still without a school or electricity, often grew up around a pond. Whenever there was a wedding in the family or a celebration like Holi or Diwali, the women would draw a kohbar or ceremonial picture.“During a wedding,” , Gangadevi narrated, “first a kohbar drawing on paper would be sent to the boy as a proposal of marriage. Each gift of cloth, jewellery or spices exchanged between the families would be wrapped in a kohbar paper. “We painted leaves and trees, flowers, birds and auspicious fish on miniature huts of papier-mâché.” A Mithila painting done with prayer and art was said to attract the blessings of the gods into the house.Scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata appeared under the spell of the Mithila women’s fluent fingers. Traditionally, they were done on walls, on papier-mâché objects, or on sheets of paper. But today, because we in the cities demand it, Mithila paintings with their sweeping lines and bright colours, crop up on clothes at crafts bazaars, on greeting cards and pen-stands, something that the villagers of Mithila would never dream of using.Gangadevi is no more. She spent her last years battling cancer. Her last history is depicted in a room at the Crafts Museum in Delhi. Fine, exquisite lines sketch her visits to doctors, the stretcher she lay on, even the medical tests she underwent. None of these picture stories are like photographs – for they are all in the Mithila style that Gangadevi brought into our lives.Gangadevi lives on through the paintings she left behind for us. Like her, hundreds of women in Mithila continue to depict our myths and religious symbols through delicate lines and bright earthy colours. And maintain the continuity of tradition by handing down their art to another generation.",

    "title": "Magic of Kondapalli Toys",
    "article": "Did you know that animals, birds, reptiles and humans learn the lessons of life through play? Any object can be used as a toy. Lion cubs even play with their parent’s tail! Human children play with objects of daily life, like spoons and cardboard boxes. But toys remain the favourite playthings of most children.In India, the oldest toys belong to the 5000 year-old Harappan civilisation. These toys were made with natural materials like clay, wood and stone. They depicted ordinary men, women, animals, birds, fruits and vegetables as well as the important professionals who existed in those times – the potter, carpenter and farmer, among others. And these ancient toys are surprisingly similar to the handmade toys of a later date.Many regions in India specialise in making toys. In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh for instance, the names of places such as Kondapalli, Nirmal, Ettikoppakka and Tirupati, are associated with wooden toys crafted with great style. A peep into the world of Kondapalli toys.Note the image of toys on the right. Don’t the figures give an impression of lifelike charm, like they are little people ready to jump out of the page any minute? Welcome to the world of Kondapalli toys.Kondapalli toys are made in and around Kondapalli, a little village in the Vijayawada district of Andhra Pradesh. The traditional craftsmen who make the famed toys are called Aryakshatriyas. The toys are made at home and the work involves the entire family. This traditional art form has been handed down from one generation to another. It continues to be the main livelihood of the people of Kondapalli.The craftsmen specialise in themes taken from their immediate surroundings. Scenes from rural life are carved and made into sets of various sizes.How are they made?Although it is difficult to infuse life into small blocks of wood, the Kondapalli toys are exceptions. They are very lively. Every small detail, including the appearance of the face, is looked into and carefully carved.Making these toys is no child’s play. It takes a very long time to fashion each one. The toys are made out of the locally-available soft Puniki wood, which is easy to carve. It is subjected to a process of slow heating, to draw out all the moisture. The limbs are carved separately and later joined to the body.The glue used consists mainly of paste made from tamarind seeds. The brushes used to colour the toys are very fine and sharp, made of goat’s hair. Both watercolours and oil paints are used to paint. The carving tools used are drill, hammer, axe, bagudari, aakrai (file) and chisels for finer work.From Mythology to Animals!Mythology, rural life and animals are the main themes on which the toys are made. Swans, peacocks and parrots are popular themes too, as are slice-of-life themes: women drawing water from a well, snake charmers, elephant with a mahout (trainer) on its back, potters, etc. Mythological figures are great favourites. Lord Krishna, the playful God, is shown playing the flute with a cow listening on.Kondapalli toys bring colour and joy. They create awareness about rural life and folklore through play. Can you think of a better way to learn about the richness of Indian mythology?In these days of mass-produced Barbie dolls, these beautiful folk toys are a reminder that each one, made by hand and so painstakingly, is unique – and it creates a beautiful connection with the world around for the child.",

    "article": "This happened a long time ago. Hemavati sat in her kitchen after a meal. There was nothing much to do, and Hemavati was bored. So she picked up the thaali or plate in which she had eaten earlier and struck it with a ladle. Taaaaang, traaaaaang, traaaaang… it went. Funny sound, she thought. But then, she liked it too. It was better than many other sounds. For instance, it was better than the snoring sounds her husband made when he slept.Soon after, the thaali she had used to create the sound, began to be featured in many music pieces. Thus goes a grandma’s tale.People say that the origins of music and musical instruments are to be found in tools and activities. They had nothing to do with music initially.Folk-stringed instruments like the ‘tuntun’ (right) are nothing but animal traps made portable. At least that’s what many people say.The idea of making a harp (extreme right) started when someone noticed the twang made by a bow and arrow.Like Hemavati, there were others who transformed kitchen vessels into musical instruments.The tabla (bottom) or dagga were discovered when pots, pans and other containers used for storing, measuring and cooking grain, were covered with animal hide or skin. Imagine a row of such vessels.It couldn’t have taken long for some enterprising soul to learn that striking the vessels rhythmically could produce a certain string of sounds. And thus must have begun the world’s first drums.But the drum is not always used for music. The African talking drums convey messages over long distances through the pitch and intensity of their sounds.Similarly, the conch shell is one of the five basic musical instruments used in India. But, like the trumpet, the conch shell was also used to announce the beginning of a battle or the achievement of a victory.The pancha vadya, or five musical instruments comprise the sankh or conch shell (right), dholak or drum (bottom left), mohori or oboes (bottom centre) and kombu or horn (bottom right) and jhanj or cymbals.It is clear that humans have been quick to see different uses of an object throughout history. It connected the various activities of their life so very beautifully. Whether it is a school peon who pounds a thaali to signal the end of a period or class, or whether it is a hotel that plays music as people have their lunches or dinners, our ancestors have tried out these ideas long, long ago. But there’s no harm in our trying to come up with something novel, is there?",

    "article": "Neeru and Shama were planning a trip to Europe for a holiday. They had been through all the travel catalogues, Lonely Planet series, and Michelins to plan their travel and stay. From friends and foren returned relatives they knew the weather backwards and had both warm and arctic-wear clothing.The final stop was this book on etiquette that friends were raving about: How Not to Say Yes While Meaning No.They sat in a group with their friends. Pooja, the authority because she had recently returned from a trip to Switzerland, read the excerpts.“A firm handshake plus direct eye contact is the standard form of greeting in Canada. Men should shake hands with women if they offer their hand, but many women will just say ‘hello’ perhaps with a nod of the head, and not shake hands. Personal space is very important. When conversing, people will stand about a half meter apart.”“What does that mean? Should I have a tape measure with me when I meet a Canadian?” asked Vineeta.“No silly,” explained Bharat. “You don’t have to toe the line.” They don’t want you stepping on their corns.”“Ha, ha, ha”, guffawed Peeter. He loved this. He had worked in Brazil. “You know, its so funny. When Latinos and Americans meet formally, they are always dancing.”He explained further. “Its unintentional and it’s called the ‘conversational tango’. When Latinos converse, they tend to stand very close. This makes Americans very uncomfortable and so they back off a step. The Latino follows with a step forward and the visitor sidesteps now. The latino keeps step and the American tries to avoid this. So they move all around the room!”“Enough”, rapped Pooja. “Back to business. Neeru, Shama are you taking notes?”Pooja droned on “to signal that you want your bill or check make a motion with the hands as if you are signing a piece of paper. . .Neeru was half listening and writing down whatever came to her head. It seemed so confusing. What was accepted in one country was not in another. Each country seemed to have developed its own quirky mannerisms. What is accepted in France is a vulgar gesture in another.For instance, kissing the cheek of a woman. A Middle Easterner would not even allow his wife or sister to be introduced to an infidel let alone allow her hand to shaken. Forget kissing her check!V for Victory? : In England Winston Churchill spread his index and middle finger to make the V sign for victory famous. This also signals the number “two” in Bulgaria. However, the symbol V has to be made with palm outward. It is considered an offensive gesture in England if done with your palm facing yourself!She was sure that all this made no sense as she was going there for only a month and if they thought she was being rude or nasty so be it. She was a tourist and foreigners are forgiven most anything. If they didn’t like it they could lump it.However she made these notes in her meticulous handwriting. Just to show how foolish the entire thing was.Sounds of Silence : Americans get uncomfortable with periods of silence. Therefore, in business or social situations, if a gap occurs, an American will quickly try to fill in with conversation. However, in China, silence is respected. So don’t be discouraged if there are long periods of no talk. Chinese use this time to contemplate.What is okay in France and Japan is not okay in China : The circular shape formed by the index and thumb finger with other fingers extended symbolises “okay” in America and France. In Japan it is often interpreted as the symbol for money, as the shape suggests a coin. In Japan if you use this in a store the cashier will give you your change in coins. However, it is interpreted as a vulgar gesture in some parts of the CIS.Don’t scratch if you itch : In Belgium, do not try to yawn, blow your nose, sneeze, or scratch yourself in the presence of others.The snapper : Finger snapping in France is both an offense and a signal. When you snap the fingers of both hands it is offensive. However, you could signal a taxi by snapping your fingers.Way to the loo : In Germany to signal the number “ONE”, hold your thumb upright. Is that how people excuse themselves to go to the loo? Neeru wondered. Weird!The Irish patch : Perhaps the most offensive gesture in Ireland would be to refuse to buy a round of drinks in a pub when it’s your turn to buy. However, in Australia you can signal that you are asking for a fight with anyone in the bar if you finish your drink and turn the glass upside down squarely on the bar.News for the nose : In Netherlands do not rub your nose with your forefinger from the bridge in a downward motion as you are saying the other person is cheap. This is even if your nose is genuinely itchy or you have a runny nose. Secondly do not get up during a meal to go to the bathroom even if you HAVE to. Or any other room for that matter.Tinker tailor : In Egypt, try not to sit with your legs crossed. However, sitting crosslegged tailor-fashion is allowed! It is common to smoke in public and considerate to offer your cigarettes to others present. So carry cartons with you as Egypt has a sizeable population.Not a Good Luck Sign : Lastly ensure that while in Paraguay and exiting Customs, Do Not cross the middle finger over the index finger as Americans do to signal ‘Good luck’. This is considered VERY bad and you will find it brings you ill luck.",

    "article": "To the people of Mumbai, the thought of rain is as natural as breathing. And they think they are always prepared for it. As the temperature drops, and there is a slight nip in the air they cannot help thinking of piping hot pakoras and garam chai or hot tea.But the visitor often drops down from the sky unexpectedly. It has the power to disrupt the lives of the people. Like it did recently.The city of Mumbai had a parched or thirsty look. Then, all of a sudden, the scene changed. It rained for a full day! It was the worst downpour in the last 50 years in the month of May. Even the weather office was surprised by the happenings. The pre-monsoon showers had arrived earlier than expected. And what an arrival! There was water, water everywhere.Water seeped into vehicles. Scooters, cars and motorcycles came to a spluttering stop! Harassed Mumbai-ites had no choice but to wade in waist-high water, pushing their vehicles that had died a sudden death. At the first sign of rain, the tarpaulin covers were put on the roads that were being redone. The covers were no help. The roads still became a slushy bog.It is the responsibility of a city’s municipal corporation to keep the roads in shape, and to see that the sewers and drains are cleaned in time for the monsoon. That is the only way to prevent streets and houses from being flooded with water and rubbish.But, like the weather office, Mumbai’s municipal corporation also was caught napping. It had not cleaned all the storm water drains. As the water gushed through the drains, out came all the rubbish that collected in them. The streets became a wet dustbin.The railways tracks are the most important lifeline for the residents of Mumbai. But they were totally covered with water in several areas. Many trains got an unexpected holiday. They did not run that day. Since most people of Mumbai depend on trains for transport, they were left standing and waiting. And wet. Many others took advantage of this unexpected “off day” by spending the day in cyber cafes.As it was, the city was drowning in water. But there was more to come. As the Arabian Sea experienced high tide, more water entered the city’s drains and caused flooding in all low-lying areas!Ground floor residents at many suburbs faced an additional problem — floods in their drawing rooms! Stagnant water seeped into several sitting rooms.But in the midst of all this fury, many Mumbai-ites braved the storm to go the Gateway of India for a ringside view of the surging Arabian Sea. As the name suggests, you can see nothing but water till the distant horizon from there.Normally, there is a great deal of activity at the Gateway of India. Regular ferry cruises are a great favourite with children and adults alike. But that day the Gateway of India stood out, stark and splendid, against the backdrop of the stormy sky. The raging sea mirrored the clouds above — gray and menacing. Even as breakers or waves crashed against the rocks, soaking bystanders to the bone, few complained — they were too busy admiring Mother Nature at her stormy best. But then that’s Mumbai for you!",

    "title": "Onam — The Harvest Festival",
    "article": "The harvest festival of Kerala, Onam, falls on Shravan day in the month of August or September. After a lush harvest, Onam is the time for the farmers to celebrate the bounties of nature and make merry. Like most festivals of India, Onam too has a legend associated with it.The story goes: A long time ago an Asura king named Mahabali ruled Kerala. He was dearly loved by his subjects and was known to be a just and wise ruler. His popularity soon spread far and wide. Mahabali, however, incurred the wrath of the gods when, besides earth, he extended his rule to the heavens and the nether world. Indra, the king of gods, did not appreciate the growing power of the asura king. The gods approached Lord Vishnu the preserver in the Hindu trinity — to help them out of the situation and to curb the growing power of the asura king. Lord Vishnu in the guise of Vamana (a brahmin dwarf) approached Mahabali for alms. Now Mahabali was a very generous man. He told Vamana to ask for anything. The Vamana asked for three paces of land and the king agreed to it.Immediately the Vamana increased his size, till he grew as big as the universe. And with one step he covered the earth. With the second step he covered the heaven and the nether world. He did not have any land to place the third step. Mahabali, who was a man of principles, offered his head as the third step. And the Vamana placed the third step on Mahabali’s head and sent him to nether world. However before placing the final step, Mahabali was granted a boon. Mahabali was allowed to return to his country once a year and visit his people. And Onam is the day when Mahabali comes to visit his people. In memory of the happy days of Mahabali’s rule, a grateful Kerala celebrates his annual home-coming with all the pomp and grandeur it can command.The glory of those ancient times is recaptured in a popular folk song, which is sung all over Kerala:When Mahabali ruled the landEveryone was equalHappily they livedDanger befell noneThere was no falsehood, or fraudAnd no untruthOnam basically celebrates the mythical king Mahabali, his golden rule and his sacrifice. It welcomes the spirit of King Mahabali and assures him that his people are happy and wish him well.Ten days of feasting, boat races, songs and dance are part of the festivities. Pookalam or floral decoration at the entrance of each house marks each day. Earthen mounds, which look like square pyramids, representing Mahabali and Vishnu are also placed in the dung-plastered courtyards. After traditional prayers and worship, the head of the household presents new clothes to the family and friends. This is followed by a lavish feast.Dancing and sports also takes precedence this week. Certain dances like Kaikotikalli, are traditionally associated with Onam. Caparisoned elephants in spectacular procession, fireworks are also an integral part of the festivities. The Vallamkalli or the boat race is another event that is synonymous with Onam and is best seen at Aranmulla and Kottayam. About 100 oarsmen row huge and graceful snake boats and men and women come from far and near to watch the snake boats skim through the water.This festival is also important because of its secular character. It is celebrated with equal fervour by the Hindus, Muslims and Christians.",

    "title": "Pablo the Pigeon Painter",
    "article": "Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Maria de los Remedios Cipriano Santisma Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso. Phew! A mouthful, but a name reckoned to be among the greatest artists of the 20th century. His paintings are worth millions and millions have seen and admired his work. A handful is fortunate to own some of his paintings. He’s better known to the world as just Pablo Picasso. To his family he is simply known as – Pablito!Picasso was born on October 25, 1881, in the Spanish town of Malaga. His father, Don Jose Ruiz, was an art teacher. His mother, Dona Maria Picasso, believed Pablo was destined for a glorious future. She thought that if Pablo joined the army he would become a general and if he joined the church he would become the next Pope!Pablo had two younger sisters, Lola and Conchita. Even before he learnt to speak, Pablo discovered that he could get what he wanted by drawing. For instance, he loved churros, the sugarcoated long, twisting fritters that were sold piping hot at stalls all over Spain. The three-year-old would just draw a spiral on a sheet of paper, and watch while his wish was soon granted!But Pablo hated school and all its rules. When Don Jose dropped Pablo at school, the boy would demand that his father should leave behind either his walking stick or his paintbrushes or the pigeon he was drawing – as a pledge that he would return.The young boy often willed himself to fall sick. Soon, he was being tutored at home, as often as his family’s funds permitted. Sometimes, the maid went to school with him, just to hold the pigeon that Pablo wanted to draw.Pablo could not pass his school exams. He would not pay attention to his lessons. Instead he loved it when he was punished, by being sent to a room, where he could then sit and draw to his heart’s desire.Occasionally, he’d signal to his uncle, who lived next door, to come and rescue him from school. Pablo would hold up a finger to signal a ‘one.’ His uncle thought he meant an hour later, so that’s when he turned up at the schoolroom door.All that while, Pablo would restlessly sit on his school bench, looking at the clock on the wall with longing, wondering why it moved so slowly. He was too young to figure out that an hour is a long time in real life.Young Pablo never did childish drawings. His first painting was of the port of Malaga, with its lighthouse. At eight, he did an oil painting of a mounted picador in a bullring because bullfighting is very important to Spanish society. Don Jose, who loved the sport, explained all its mysteries to him.Soon, Don Jose had to shift to a job in Corunna. At ten, Pablo hated numbers in class, but easily translated them into his beloved pigeons. “I’ll show them what I can do,” he resolved. “I won’t miss a single detail…”“The little eye of the pigeon is round like an 0. Under the 0 a 6, under that a 3. The wings are like 2s. The little feet rest on the table, as if on a horizontal line. Underneath it all, the total.” That’s how Pablo coped with math through drawing.In September 1892, Don Jose decided to enrol Pablo – whose genius he recognised by then – in his own art class. Picasso recalls, “My father cut off the feet of a dead pigeon. He pinned them to a board in a proper position, and I copied them in detail until he was satisfied.” Don Jose was so impressed that he even got Pablo to paint the feet of all the pigeons in his own canvases.When little Conchita fell very ill, 13-year-old Pablo pledged never to paint again if his sister could be saved. Unfortunately, she died. That’s when Don Jose handed over his brushes and colours to Pablo, and promised never to paint again himself!Before they left Corunna, Don Jose arranged for an exhibition of Pablo’s art in the back room of a shop that sold curtains, umbrellas and knick-knacks. Not many works were sold, especially when people discovered that the artist was not yet 14! It was Pablo’s first one-man show.It was from these small beginnings that the previous century’s greatest artist, came into being!",

    "title": "Peru's Barefoot Librarians",
    "article": "Twelve year-old Leonardo Herrera had never seen a book in his life although he knew how to read. He and his friends used to carve letters and numbers on cactus leaves after seeing their teacher do the same on small blackboards.He belongs to poor peasant family in Bambamarca in Peru. His family grows maize and potatoes in a place which is 12,000 feet above sea-level.But Leonardo wanted to see what a book looks like. So he asked the new priest in his parish to give him one. But there was no electricity in his village. So Leonardo borrowed candles from the church and sat up all night reading it. By dawn, he was at the door of the priest asking for another book to read.John Medcalf, the priest, was moved. He also realised that people would love to read if given a chance. But he knew how difficult it was for Leonardo and those in his village to get books.And yet, no one can be taught to read and write without books. To make people grow to love books, they have be with them. But, how could Medcalf make this possible in a poor, remote region like Bambamarca? As he writes in Index, a London-based magazine, there could be only one solution. By bringing books to people.But how could this be done? Mobile libraries or vehicles carrying books would be too expensive and difficult to maintain in the rough and rocky terrain of Peru. So what other method could be used to bring books to the peasant-reader? It had to be direct, easy and informal.Medcalf drew inspiration from the barefoot doctors of China. And that was how the barefoot librarians first appeared in the villages of northern Peru, almost thirty years ago.The librarians began by going from village to village, lending books to campesinos, which is what villagers in Peru are known. They helped start The Rural Library Network of Peru.At first, they were teachers of the village schools, to which these rural libraries were attached. But the teachers were not very interested in the job because it meant a lot of hard work. So, village elders took on the job themselves.Today, there are 600 village libraries across Peru under The Rural Library Network. The barefoot librarians who walk up to 15 hours a day with knapsacks are its lifeline. Some of them even ride on their pack animals carrying saddle-bags. Each bag contains about 24 books. A typical selection includes books on health and first-aid, poetry, legends, folk tales, and religious books.Children’s stories, read hungrily by both adults and kids, and books on law, are hot favourites.Every month, the librarians travel to the city of Cajamarca to exchange the books. They have become so important that now they have been given the responsibility of guarding their culture. Like protecting archaeological sites from trouble-makers. Lately, the librarians (and some readers) have taken to writing and publishing illustrated books themselves.Not all are happy with this state of affairs. The rich and powerful of Peru don’t like it that access to books is making the campesinos think. The government, too, is indifferent. But for the villagers, nothing could be more wonderful.Instruction books help them earn money. Books on agriculture, for example, are being used to learn bee keeping and other farming skills. Peasant families are no longer keen on migrating to cities. Story books keep them entertained. Law books teach them how to protect themselves from being used. Books are helping them discover opportunities which they have failed to see so far in their villages.And, Leonardo, the boy who inspired the library revolution, is today a village school-teacher. As much in love with books as ever. The barefoot librarians have ensured that he remain that way forever.",

    "article": "June 10: Who is that mousy lady in a sari? What is the clown doing with a huge ball that looks like the sun? And what is this — a man with the heads of two big-eyed cows in his hands? All of them look like they want to tell a story. Their story. And that’s exactly what they do, for they are all puppets. And when their master pulls the strings and speaks from behind the curtain, they sing and dance, play and fight, laugh and cry.Some days ago, puppet groups from all over India got together at the Indian capital of New Delhi for an exhibition and festival. When people entered the exhibition at the India International Centre, it was like entering a magic land of fairies, or the animal land of the Panchatantra. But some puppets also made you think of children who live a hard life on the street and work for a living.Puppets on a StringSeveral of them came from Rajasthan, where puppet making and puppet plays have been passed down from father to son for many generations. They are people from the Bhat community, and perform puppet shows in the same way as their grandfathers or their grandfathers did. The Aakar Puppet Group was one such group (Aakar means form or shape in Hindi).But there were other puppet groups which have been formed by artists who have not learnt puppetry as a part of their family profession. Like the Ishara group of the famous artist, Dadi Pudumjee.In the evenings, puppet plays were held in the garden with magical lights and shadows. And children and adults watched with open mouths as fairies danced in the air and tall giants walked the earth. There were several plays that were especially for children.One such play was ‘The Flowering Tree’. It was the story of a poor village girl who gets magical powers. She turns herself into a tree which bears the most beautiful and fragrant flowers in the kingdom. ‘Mila and the Clock’ was the story of a 12-year-old girl who likes machines and not dolls. And ‘Lal Kaleen’ (Red Carpet), was a story of street children who have to work for a living and are treated like animals by their employers.Some groups like the Aakar group presented a show on how puppets were first made. They told a story of why their shows are not so popular with Indians in today’s television age, while they have received praise in foreign countries for their performances.",

    "article": "Vishnudas Bhave’s puppets had to go through a long ordeal before they finally got to the right place and in the hands of the right people. It was not just a long journey but a tough one too.This story dates back to the year 1843, when the father of Marathi theatre, Vishnudas Bhave created his puppets, in Maharashtra’s Sangli district. They were not ordinary wooden puppets. They were so life-like that it seemed they would talk to you any moment. They put life into every play that he put up on stage. ‘Seeta Swayamvar’ became the most well known of his puppet dramas.The puppets were as real for Vishnudas as were humans. His puppets were like children to him, and he took great care of them. But everything changed with his death in 1901. His puppets became orphans. For the next 47 years they lay uncared for in a dark room. One fateful day, in 1948, a fire broke out in the house and burnt more than half of Vishnudas’ treasured puppets. Even this tragedy did not make people take notice of the treasure that lay neglected, says a recent report in ‘The Indian Express’.Puppets on a String Dance Again []It was only about 20 years ago, in the early 1980s, that the puppets were remembered. One individual wanted to bring back to life on stage all of Vishnudas Bhave’s puppets. This man was the Mumbai-based singer-actor, Bhalchandra Pendharkar.But, tragedy struck again when the truck carrying the precious dolls from Sangli to Mumbai suffered a mishap on the outskirts of Mumbai. The puppets lay by the wayside in Girgaum for several months, suffering the onslaught of torrential rains during the monsoon. When it rains in Mumbai, there is so much water on the streets that children can even swim in it, like eager ducks.Totally ruined by the rains, the puppets finally found their way to a workshop in Dadar, Mumbai. The workshop was run by the husband-wife team of Ramdas and Aparna Padhye. From then onward started the rebirth of Vishnudas’ puppets. The Padhyes separated each and every joint of the puppets and re-created them. It took them almost five years to recreate 20 puppets. There was very little written material on how Vishnudas’ arranged his puppet plays.Going by a very short document prepared by Vishnudas himself a long time ago, the Padhyes created a play from a situation in the Mahabharata, ‘Draupadi Swayamvar’. The play was performed in Mumbai last month. It had taken the Padhyes almost 15 years to infuse life into the puppets.This was only the beginning. Padhye also took help from organisations like the Puppeteers of America to get more material on Vishnudas puppets. He also decided to create a special Bhave webpage on his website on puppetry.Not only this, he took Bhave’s puppets to London for a lecture demonstration where the experts were amazed to see such refined work. “They wanted some puppets for sample study. I straightaway refused. I shall not part with this legacy even for one lakh pounds (100,000 pounds)” remarked Padhye.",

    "title": "Rabi, the Budding Poet",
    "article": "When Rabindranath Tagore won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 for his poems in Gitanjali , he was the first Asian to be so honoured. We’ve seen pictures of him with his flowing grey beard and smiling eyes, clad in a long saffron robe. We know him as the man who founded the unusual gurukula or school at Shantiniketan in West Bengal in 1901.We also know that he’s the only poet whose verses have been chosen as the national anthems of two countries – India and Bangladesh.Rabindranath Tagore [Olga Popova / Shutterstock.com]What many of us don’t know is that many of his adult dreams were shaped by his childhood, his family and his schooling. Let’s flip a few pages backwards, and find out what he was like as a child named Rabi, for that’s what his family called him.Rabi was born on May 7, 1861. He was the second youngest of nine sons and six daughters of Debendranath Tagore and Sarada Devi.Debendranath – who was a rather saintly man – lived in the hill station of Dalhousie, in Uttar Pradesh, when Rabi was young. The child missed his Baba, who was so far away.When his younger brother died suddenly as an infant, Rabi found himself as the baby of the joint Tagore family, at their sprawling mansion at Jorasanko in Calcutta. Its inner courtyard could hold at least a thousand people, and often did, at social gatherings of the Tagores.Rabi was never alone, but constantly surrounded by cousins and nephews who wanted to play. His older sister’s son, Satya, was closest to him. The Tagore children faced a stream of tutors all day long, each with a cane in hand!The Jorasanko mansion must have seemed like an unexplored kingdom to little Rabi, who enjoyed playing alone, so that his imagination could soar. At five or six, he would choose a large room surrounded by verandahs with straight, tall railings, which he pretended were his pupils. He would imagine that he was teaching, and hit each railing with a cane very often!When Rabi did go to his first school, the Oriental Seminary in Calcutta in 1868, he hated it. If he didn’t do his lessons, he had to stand on a bench with his slate on his head. He got caned, too, especially for daydreaming. He spent all his time looking out of the window at the blue sky, the leaves on the trees or the bright flowers. Perhaps that’s what inspired Shantiniketan, where lessons were done under shady trees, without classrooms!Since all the Tagores spoke Bengali at home, they were puzzled when Rabi came home one day chanting his first words in English: Singel single melaling melaling! It was only when he grew older that Rabi figured out what the words really were: ‘Singing singing merrily merrily!’When he was 11, Debendranath asked Rabi if he’d like to travel to Dalhousie with him. Rabi jumped with joy at the idea. But Satya didn’t like the idea of his playmate going away. So, he told him terrible tales of how the train might toss Rabi out of the window or through the roof as it jerked along! Of course, Rabi arrived in Dalhousie safely despite his childish fears.In spite of the cold in Dalhousie, Rabi loved it there. After a cold bath every morning, Debendranath would teach him Sanskrit, which he loved for the rest of his life.To make young Rabi come to terms with figures, his father gave him money for the household and asked him to keep a daily account of it. But Rabi was so absentminded that his account book showed money left over every day, even when it had all been spent! Debendranath joked, “Rabi, I’ll give all my money to you. Then, it’ll never be spent!”Back in Calcutta, the Tagore home was constantly filled with music, theatre and other cultural activities. Rabi later wrote, “I do not remember a time when I could not sing.” No wonder his songs, or Rabindra Sangeet, later became so famous.Rabi was next sent to the Normal School. By this time, his older brothers came to be very proud of Rabi’s poetic way with words.When the principal of the school heard Rabi was a young poet, he made up two lines of poetry and asked the boy to complete the verse. Imagine his surprise when Rabi did, simply, and with ease!Rabi was 14 when he first read out one of his poems at the Hindu Mela in Calcutta. That’s when the world first heard the voice of Rabindranath Tagore, the poet who was proud to be an Indian.",

The rat population has suddenly grown in such large numbers that Paris may soon need a Pied Piper to weed them out of the city.Rats! Rats! Rats! []The rat boom happened because of a new underground railway system. When work began on the railway system, workmen began digging the ground to make tunnels for the trains. In the process, they broke hordes of rats’ houses and drove them away from the ground.But, they did not go very far. They just moved overground.And raided the city.Two of these rats even became celebrities after they were caught red-handed by a camera. The duo were biting into some snacks kept in the display window of a well known shop, Fauchon Foodstore.Jean-Claude Crochard, the director of the foodstore, has been a very unhappy man after he saw the photo published in the newspapers. He spent the entire day getting his shop cleaned and disinfected.While Chochard and other people in Paris get more and more unhappy over the rat menace, the rat catchers have been having a field day.

    "title": "Ride the Camel",
    "article": "The world looks very strange from a camel’s back. On a recent trip to Rajasthan, we travelled on camel back from the city of Jaisalmer to the Sam dhani or sand dunes of the adjoining Thar Desert. We were travelling to Thar, just 42 km away, to watch its dazzling sunsets.Deoram and RajuWhen we set out from Jaisalmer, the desert city famous for its golden fortress, the early evening sun dazzles our eyes. Bright, beige wasteland stretches all around us for miles. Tiny babul shrubs grow by the roadside. There are no villages or huts in sight.A patch of red stirs in the desert far away. Closer up, it proves to be the safa or turban worn by a camel-herder. His name is Deoram. He and his family of Rabaris or camel-herders have lived this way of life for centuries.Soon, we find ourselves trying to stay atop our camel mounts. Their walk is awkward and lurching. To us, it feels like one step backwards to every one forward. It’s quite dizzying to be so far away from the sand beneath our feet.Raju, my mount, has a snout that buzzes with sand flies. He snorts often, but they return to bug him. So, he trots and frets and tosses his head wildly, which makes it even tougher not to take a toss onto the golden desert sands.Deoram, a 28-year-old Rabari with a fierce moustache, clad in a weatherworn white dhoti and kurta, owns Raju.Pirdan, Deoram’s younger brother, is bright-eyed and speaks fluent Hindi, while most Rabaris speak Marwari, the regional language around Jaisalmer. We chat as our caravan of four camels trot along.“I’ve had Raju for 12 years now,” says Deoram. “I bought him at the annual cattle fair at Pushkar near Ajmer. He cost somewhere between Rs. 15,000 to 20,000, I don’t remember exactly…”Living by camelsHow does a Rabari family live around the year? “We live by our camels,” explains Pirdan. “We sometimes hire them out to draw carts. During the tourist season from October to February, we charge Rs. 100 a ride to the dunes. We own four camels, so we make Rs. 400 a day.”But how about summer under the blazing desert sun? “Times are not so good in summer,” adds Pirdan’s burly uncle, who’s riding a camel named Mayuri. “Since we all live together and we aren’t farmers, we have little to eat then, because our land is dry.”“Harrrrrrrrrrrumph\", says Raju, lurching along, as if adding a thought to our talk.Does Raju respond to his name? “Of course,” answers Deoram with affection. “When he’s out grazing and I call his name like this, Rajooooooooo, he stops wherever he is. It’s easy to find him then.”Pirdan, the young groomPirdan has studied more than anyone else in this Rabari family – up to Class X. He’s proud to know so much more about the world.But he’s different from others in Class X in a basic way. Pirdan tells us how: “I got married four years ago, at 16. I was engaged when I was seven. She’s a Rabari, too.”That sounds so strange to our city-wise ears. Does Pirdan find his situation unusual? “It’s part of our tradition,” he responds. “I’m proud to be a Rabari. We even allow widows to marry again.”We think about all we’ve learnt about Rabaris as we weave, sway and stagger towards the horizon. Time doesn’t seem to count to their ageless way of life.More camel facts come into focus as Deoram talks to us. He reveals that the camels from Jaisalmer are known for their speed and can cover over 100 km in a single night. The Rabaris of Rajasthan, we discover, can be either Hindu or Muslim. There are even some among them who are Muslims with Hindu names.Golden sand dunesAt this point, Raju canters over a curve in the horizon. And suddenly, the sand dunes are before us – wave upon wave of golden sand. They are much more beautiful than any geography book or TV programme has ever suggested.In the distance, a procession of camels in brightly embroidered cloth move along. Their riders are just dark blurs to us.Overhead, the sun is still burning bright. It seems to burn the edge of the dunes farthest away. By degrees, the sky turns a brilliant orange, fading into pink, then a misty purple. Even the desert seems to pick up these shades. As we watch, it no longer looks golden brown.Deoram and Raju brought wonderful adventure into our lives, both on and off camelback. We’re already planning a trip back to the sand dunes, perhaps during the three-day desert festival at Jaisalmer from February 6-8, 2001.",

    "article": "Suitcase – checked. Diary – checked. I am writing my last lines before I take off in the time machine. Time machine – checked! This time it’s going to ancient Rome at the height of its empire. Only this morning I read somewhere that when in Rome, do as the Romans do. If you want to accompany me, sit in your seat, hold the mouse firmly, and whatever you do, don’t press the escape key on your keyboard.Whoosh!I have reached the Rome of about 1700 years ago (if you want to have the correct year, 1688 years ago). I have landed on a road called the Via Appia Antica. There’s great excitement in the air. It seems there is a big gladiator fight on at the Colosseum – that huge open air stadium built for gladiatorial sport, where people were seated according to their social class.That old man in the corner does not seem to be very bothered, though. He looks very relaxed. He is wearing a tunic with a large woollen cloth. It is not sewn or pinned, just draped carefully over the tunic (now I know from where Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan learnt to drape his shawl like that).Ancient roman man and womanThe old man tells me that it is called toga, and is considered the typical male dress of Rome. You can tell from a person’s toga as to how important or wealthy a person he is. An off-white toga with a broad purple border is associated with the upper classes. An off-white toga that is not dyed at all is worn by a commoner or plebian. That fashionable looking man has his hair longer than the others who seem to like their hair cut short.The women are wearing something more voluminous and woollen. It’s a long piece of cloth draped around their waist, with the excess material folded and pinned on both shoulders. Wealthy women use golden or silver brooches to fasten the cloth over their shoulders. I must say their hair styles are very elaborate. And their hair seems to be bleached.The old man says this is the basic garment for women, and is called doric peplos and has been worn by women since the beginning of the sixth century BC. Made from a rectangle of woven wool, it measures about six feet in width and about eighteen inches more than the height of the wearer – from shoulder to ankle in length.I don’t think I’m in the mood to watch a gladiatorial contest, so I am heading for home.Home again to books and the WebOkay, my research makes a lot of things clear. False hair, wigs, hair lotions and dyes were all known to the Romans. Much like today, many women had their hair bleached blonde. There was a flourishing trade in blonde hair to supply the demand for false hair. They had very complicated hair styles that their natural hair was not sufficient for.Even among men, while most of them tended to keep their hair short, the fashionable ones had a liking for hair curled with curling irons, and being pampered for hours at the barber’s’. But they were a small minority.This is incredible! The more I see of the past, the more I feel that trends keep going back and forth. I no longer know whether I am old fashioned or new fashioned!",

    "title": "Saraswati River in the Thar Desert",
    "article": "The vedas mention the mighty Saraswati river flowing down the Himalayas and then westwards towards Rajasthan. But Rajasthan is a desert. So where did this huge river, which the vedas say was bigger than the Ganga, disappear?It is widely believed that this river still flows under the Thar desert, though no one has been able to prove this for sure.Even the epic Mahabharata, written in 1000 BC, mentions Saraswati as the once-mighty river that was drying up. As of now, the Saraswati has completely disappeared from the earth’s surface, which is why several people even doubt that it ever existed. For long scientists have been hunting for traces of the Saraswati in the desert.A few years back The Sunday Observer newspaper reported that two scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Dr S M Rao and Dr K M Kulkarni, claimed to have traced the Saraswati in the Thar desert. They have traced the course of the river using satellite images. This is called Landsat imagery.Rao and Kulkarni say that the Saraswati originated from the same source as the Sutlej river, which flows through Punjab. Then it flows through northern Rajasthan, Bhawalpur and Sind in Pakistan till it empties out in the Rann of Kutch. All the time remaining underground.The scientists discovered many underground fresh-water channels and claimed that the water was that of river Saraswati’s. They found a naturally-occurring form of hydrogen, called tritium, in the water. The tritium helped them to establish how old the water was.In channels at Ghantiali, Kuriaberi and Nathurakuan in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan, the water was found to be 8,000 years old, the scientists said. The narrow strip of vegetation along the course of this underground water body, as seen through the satellite, also supports this theory. The presence of the vegetation is remarkable as the surrounding areas continue to be dry.Since the Saraswati is a legendary river, there are several theories about what its original course was. The river has changed its course to the west at least five times. Earlier, a study linked the ancient river to the Ghaggar river that exists today. Some other scholars say that at one time the Sutlej flowed into the Saraswati and then later shifted to westwards to join the Indus river.Some other scholars say that the Indus itself may have been a tributary of the Saraswati at one time. But all these are just theories, no one knows for sure what the Saraswati’s course was.",

    "title": "Schoolboy's Diary – 4000 years ago",
    "article": "When I was in the fourth standard, I got my first real diary as a present from a cousin. It made me feel very important because it was gifted to me in the year for which it had been printed. Until then the elders had always shoved at me, two or three-year-old diaries in which the listed holidays and Sundays made no sense. Naturally!It was a diary bound in dark brown leather and was printed by some company that must have been making a lot of money. And the first week of my life as a diary owner went by in a haze. I would keep looking at it, my heart swelling with pride. And then I would inhale the smell of fresh paper. It was heavenly.In the second week, I suddenly felt nervous. I had not written a single word in the diary. And now each page seemed to be looking at me in sorrow for the way it was being ignored. So I decided to keep an account of how I spent the day at school.I kept my promise to the diary. Every day after coming back from school, I would take out the diary, open the page dated for that day and write about what happened. But a strange thing happened – each page, instead of looking as if it came straight out of a famous writer’s book, looked dull and monotonous.The entries were almost identical: “Went to school. Had a class test. The English teacher had not come. Lunch was good – not mine but Atul’s. Have got homework for tomorrow.”The entries went on in a similar vein for the next six months.Imagine my surprise when I recently read a 4000-year-old account of a young boy’s day in school. It sounded almost the same! This boy was from Sumer that was part of the Mesopotamian civilisation (now in present-day Iraq).The Sumerians, as they were called, are responsible for a lot of things. They constructed the first cities. They invented writing and the idea that children must go to a place like school for education and instruction.Rrelief sculpture of ancient Assyrian warriorsWhat was the account of the boy’s day in school like? Well, almost like mine but 4000 years ago! Unbelievable! It went like this: “Arriving at school in the morning I recited my tablet, ate my lunch, prepared my new tablet, wrote it, finished it, then they assigned me my oral work…When school was dismissed, I went home…”They did not have paper books. Their writing was impressed on wet clay with a reed pen. The clay was baked hard in the sun. It was called a tablet. Their writing was called cuneiform. It consisted of wedge shaped symbols that made up words.I read this account in a book called, The Mammoth Book of How It Happened, by a gentleman called Jon E Lewis. In a fascinating manner, he has put together into one collection, eye-witness accounts of moments in history, both eventful and ordinary. Imagine, eye-witness accounts of almost 4000 years of history, though clearly, it is events of the western world that dominate the accounts by people of the west.Yet, the book told me that for schoolchildren anywhere in the world and probably, at any time in history, school has always meant the same. Perhaps, writing diaries too!",

    "article": "Superman flies. Mowgli grins. A pig speaks and a dog identifies a thief. Children live in the land of toys and ice creams. You must have seen one or the other in cartoons or movies.So how does it all happen? How does it start?Well, it starts like most things do — with an idea.A person, or a group of persons, may have an idea.Then they work upon that idea and create a story around it. A story may be something that one narrates or reads. But you need to do something more if you want to see this story in moving images — on stage or on screen.Then they go step by step with the story. The development of the story into ‘action and words’ or ‘moving images’, from beginning to end, is called a script.Now think of the characters of the story. No, do not think about the actors who are going to play the roles. Think about the characters of the story. Where they live, how they behave and talk, who they meet, how they look — all these must be described in the script.So, the script answers some very basic questions:What is the story about? (The subject)When did the events in the story take place? (The time: past, present or future)Where is the story based? (Country, city/town/village, rich house/poor house)Who are the people in the story? (The characters)How do they behave? (Action and words, or dialogues)Why do they behave as they do? (Background of characters, their circumstances, their dreams and desires)These questions when answered or described in a steady progression of the story form a script.Now try your hand at writing a script. Choose your favourite film or cartoon and describe everything that you see or hear in it in great detail. Remember, you should not just describe the words and actions of the characters (for example, “Rajesh picked up his little sister in his arms and said ‘I love you’\") but also the colour of their clothes, the kind of house they live in, the view from their window, the season, the time of the day. In short — everything.And guess what? You just might have written a script!",

    "article": "You want to send a message to someone. Immediately. No problem. You just pick up a land phone or a mobile phone, or send an email. The telegram is still there but many of us have forgotten about it.Now travel back in time to France, 206 years ago, when there was none of your latest technology. Not even the telegraph. But people still felt the need to send long distance messages.Signals of the Past []It was then that a Frenchman called Chappe invented a code for the alphabet. It was called the semaphore. It was a code in which different positions of the human arm stood for a particular alphabet. Thus, there were 26 positions. People sent messages in this way by holding a flag in each hand to make sure that the positions were seen clearly, and a correct message was sent.Later, an instrument with two mechanical arms was also used to send messages. The instrument was named semaphore after the code. It is used at sea to this day.Then, it was the turn of the semaphore to be used for railway signals. It was used as a railway signal for the first time 159 years ago, in 1841. A signal arm in a horizontal position indicated that the driver must stop. A halfway down signal told the driver to move carefully till the next signal. A signal straight upwards told the driver that the way was all clear. The signals were painted red.The semaphore was a great advancement on the early railway signals. A ball and a cloth kite was used for the purpose. A kite taken to the top of a pole meant danger. A ball on top of the pole meant a go-ahead signal.With the invention of electricity, the railway signals also got electrified. A red light meant ‘stop’, amber meant ‘be careful’ and green meant ‘go’. This became the code everywhere.",

    "title": "Summer music of the trees",
    "article": "I always used to think that the drive across a four kilometre stretch from my house to the main road was a pain. Actually, not all of it was a pain. The car bounced up and down a few bumpy patches the first kilometer, then zoomed across a smooth 2.5 kilometre slope before struggling in a three-legged hurdle race at the final half kilometre. Reason: there was a traffic signal there and almost everyone in the world seemed to want to go somewhere at the same time. And exactly at the moment when our car inched towards the front, the lights would turn red again. It was a clear five minute wait there.And there was not a single happy face to be found at that traffic signal. After some time, I lost all pleasure even in the early part of the drive, because as soon as I sat in the car the traffic signals burst into life in my mind signalling – you guessed it – RED!Then one day something magical happened, and I can’t pretend that I was intelligent enough to think of it. The fact is my neck was a bit stiff that morning. In my dream the previous night I had battled weird guys with red traffic lights for eyes. So at the dreaded traffic signal, I moved my neck to and fro to ease the stiffness. As I moved my head to the left I saw it for the first time. Beyond the pavement a gulmohar tree with a vivid crown of bright red and orange blossoms in bunches. The small leaves were equally beautiful. I racked my head for expressions to describe them. Fern-like? Delicate like the filigree patterns jewellers make with gold or silver wires? Looking at the gulmohar the stiffness in my neck disappeared.In the light breeze the branches of the gulmohar were swaying. The leaves were rustling and shimmering, as if brimming with happiness. It seemed…yes…it seemed like the gulmohar was listening to some private music. The gulmohar was music conductor and listener at the same time. I was enchanted.Gulmohar (Delonix regia) is also know as Peacock Flower, Flame of the Forest, and Flame Tree.The gulmohar’s small neighbour was more sober. I recognised it as an Ashoka tree. It stood ramrod straight, at attention like a scout. The tapering leaves huddled close, forming a dense and conical crown. I could have been mistaken but I felt that the Ashoka did not have a private music collection of its own like the gulmohar. This tree liked to spend its time in serious thought. Living close to the gulmohar had not changed it. My gaze shifted to its neighbour.Now this one was a beauty in its own way. In the first week of May, the amaltas was going through its annual fancy dress. The branches were bare. Long, dark brown rods hung everywhere – these were pods of the previous year. In complete contrast to the bare look of the tree were these sunlight yellow clusters of flowers. Like long, soft feathers hanging from the branches. I felt like getting out of the car and rubbing the yellow blossoms gently across my face. The amaltas and gulmohar seemed to be friends. Rather, they seemed like two young girls, or boys if you will, planning a happy outing. The Ashoka looked like their parent or guardian content to be in its own world.Suddenly the trees seemed to be moving away from me. Had they set out on their outing already? Then I realised what it was. The traffic lights had turned green and we were on our way. For the first time I felt the traffic signal was not such a bad sort. It had got me new friends. Though I must take some credit for it too; after all I had used my eyes to really see something after a long time. Did that feel good!",

    "title": "The Best Storyteller in the World",
    "article": "Bajai,” as we called grandmother, was the best storyteller in the world. Her tales of jewelled ladies and brave warriors, of civilisations that ended due to famine, floods, war or volcanic eruptions, filled our young lives with fantasy.Nestling in the foothills of Mussoorie is a tiny village called Johri Gaun (Johri village) where we spent part of our summer and winter vacations every year. They were fun-filled days of sun-kissed air and raucous laughter, when we cousins met and had a great time. On our long walks we would nibble berries or catch colourful dragon flies, which we had nicknamed “helicopters”. I always collected red ones. If anyone caught a whirring red helicopter they would yell out for me and I would run and open my shoe box to put it in.By the time I really discovered Bajai, she was a very old woman, with countless wrinkles on her face. My mother was her youngest daughter. Bajai always wore white and smoked Batman cigarettes. I never got to meet Bajee (Grandfather). He was a prisoner of war in Italy, during the Second World War (1939-1945).He returned home alive but riddled with asthma, to which he succumbed. Bajai never remarried. Nor did she let her maternal relatives pitch in to help a young widow and her seven children survive. Instead, she started tilling her land and growing her own foodgrains and vegetablesNow, when I think of it, Bajai always smelt like the first shower on freshly tilled earth. Her hands were always calloused, but even in their roughness there was a gentleness she could not disguise.She always started her stories with a saying, “To the listener a garland of gold, to the story teller a garland of all forest flowers and this tale that I tell you today will be heard in heaven.”When she told her stories, we always crowded around her. Each one of us fought to be the closest to her as she took out a burning twig to light her filter-less cigarette. She would clear her throat looking at our eager faces. The kitchen fire would throw our dark shadows on the mud-washed walls. Our eagerly nodding heads would appear large and distorted in the lantern light.And so would start a magical journey of words creating images larger than life. Even now, 30 year later, I just need to close my eyes to get that smell of a wood fire and dung cakes and Bajai’s voice lilting as she imitated the sound of hooves on which the handsome prince rode…Looking back, I think Bajai loved telling us stories. Just when the hero or heroine was caught in a difficult situation, she would fumble for her cigarette. And all of us would jump to hand her a smoking twig to light her cigarette so that she could continue with her story. Whoever succeeded in handing her the twig laughed in sheer happiness.We would often fight amongst ourselves on whom Bajai loved the most. When we asked her she would laugh and say, I love you all. If we insisted, she would spin out a long story of how she would love us till the red necked parrot came home or the rains came home to make the tiny rice seedling grow big and strong. We would laugh loudly, jump up and down, stick out our tongues at each other or thumb our noses. In our hearts each of us felt that Bajai loved her or him the most.Bajai’s stories were so much a part of our lives that even her last day was like a story she had once told. It wasn’t yet dawn, when a sound woke me up. All of us slept in the attic, but no one else stirred. Everyone was sound asleep. I opened the window. There was a little rain and mist. I gaped in open-mouthed wonder at a beautiful chariot which stood in the courtyard. It was drawn by two white horses and a pretty woman in white was helping Bajai up the chariot.“Wait for me Bajai,” I yelled. Bajai looked up and smiled. She looked beautiful. There were no wrinkles on her face. Her gray hair was open and a few tendrils lifted in the wind. Bajai waved and smiled, and the soft wind carried her message. It was what she always said to me, “I love you till the rains come home…”I do not know if it was a dream or Bajai’s final farewell, but I woke up and my pillow was wet.",

    "title": "The Birth of Christ",
    "article": "Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. Everyone knows that. Do you know the entire story of his birth?Let me narrate it in brief. Over 2000 ago, Roman emperor Caesar Augustus, issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. So everyone went to his or her hometowns to register. A carpenter called Joseph, who was in Nazareth in Galilee in the Middle East (which was also part of the empire), went to nearby Bethlehem. He went there with Mary, who was to be married to him and was expecting a child.While they were there, Mary gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped the baby in clothes and placed him in a manger or stable, because there was no room for them in the town inn.Meanwhile, a few shepherds in the fields nearby were keeping watch over their flocks at night when they were suddenly visited by an angel. The angel informed them that Mary’s baby was in fact Christ the Lord and had been born to be their saviour.So the shepherds, called the Magi, followed a bright star that led them to Bethlehem. They went with gifts and pronounced the baby as the Lord. The baby grew up to be Jesus Christ, founder of Christianity.A typical fairy tale, huh? Like fairy tales, the original Christmas story too is full of divine and miraculous elements: the promise to a virgin that she will have a baby, angelic choirs in the skies announcing the birth and the subsequent arrival of mysterious strangers bearing gifts fit for a king.But unlike fairytales, this one is firmly rooted in the context in which it is set. The story is set in a political context of oppression that is as chillingly familiar in the world today, as it was 20 centuries ago in the country of Judaea, where Joseph and Mary lived. Mary gives birth in a stable because the couple has had to travel from their hometown to Bethlehem, so that they can be registered in the census.The Roman emperor who issued the census order has a vast empire. Tiny Judaea is one of them. The people of Judaea yearn for freedom, and are subjugated not only by the emperor himself, but also by a puppet king whom the emperor has appointed to rule over them.The puppet king, Herod the Great, is a cruel and vengeful tyrant. When Herod hears that the gift-bearing strangers are looking for a new king who has just been born he decides to eliminate the potential rivals by ordering a massacre of all newborn male children. Joseph and his family escape by fleeing to another country and not returning until the tyrant is dead.By depicting the misery of the people under oppressive Roman rule, the story hints that people were in fact ready for something new. That old religions and rulers were suiting them no more. So when the wandering messiah Jesus Christ arrived with his simple and teachings 30 years later, people embraced the teachings wholeheartedly.The divine and miraculous elements in the Christmas story are not just sugar frosting on the crueller elements. They are there as a hope that oppression may be transformed and overcome. One does not have to share the faith of a Christian to derive a few lessons from the story.",

    "title": "The Bittersweet Story of Chocolate",
    "article": "Many, many centuries ago, sometime around 400 BC, in the jungles of South andCentral America, the Cacao plant was discovered which in the ages to come would become the most desired foodstuff in the whole world.The plant was found to have hard pods with each pod containing brown beans that later became the main ingredient in the making of chocolate. Cacao was a very important plant even then as it was actually used as money by the Mayans and later by the Aztecs.Cacao made its way into Europe when Columbus returned to Spain and displayed a treasure trove of many strange and wonderful things from his travels before King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. Among these were a few dark brown beans that looked like almonds and seemed most unpromising. These were the cacao beans, the source of all chocolate and cocoa.The King and Queen never dreamed how important these cacao beans could be. It remained for Hernan Cortez, the great Spanish explorer, to popularize this drink commercially.During his conquest of Mexico, Cortez found the Aztec Indians serving a drink made of these beans to Montezuma, the Aztec ruler. This drink was called “chocolatl” by the Indians, meaning warm liquid. In 1519, Montezuma served this drink chocolatl to his Spanish guests in great golden goblets, treating it like a food for the gods.For all its regal importance, however, Montezuma’s chocolatl was very bitter, and the Spaniards did not like its bitterness. To make the mixture more agreeable, Cortez sweetened it with sugarcane.When they took this drink back to Spain, the idea found favour and the drink underwent several more changes with newly discovered spices, such as cinnamon and vanilla. Ultimately, someone decided the drink would taste better if served hot.The new drink soon won favour, especially among the Spanish aristocracy. Spain proceeded to plant cacao in its overseas colonies, which gave birth to a very profitable business. Remarkably enough, the Spanish succeeded in keeping the art of the cocoa industry a secret from the rest of Europe for nearly a hundred years.Spanish monks, who had been consigned to process the cacao beans, finally let the secret out. It did not take long before chocolate was acclaimed throughout Europe as a delicious, health-giving food.Drinking chocolate or what was called cocoa, was made possible with the invention of the cocoa press. The press helped to improve the quality of the beverage by squeezing out part of the cocoa butter, the fat that occurs naturally in these beans. From then on, drinking chocolate had more of the smooth consistency and the pleasing aroma it has today.The 19th century marked two more revolutionary developments in the history of chocolate. In 1847, an English company called Fry and Sons introduced solid “eating chocolate” through the development of fondant chocolate. This was a smooth and velvety variety that has almost completely replaced the old coarse-grained chocolate that formerly dominated the world market.The second development occurred in 1875 in Vevey, Switzerland, when Daniel Peter devised a way of adding milk to the chocolate, creating the product we enjoy today known as milk chocolate.Make your own chocolate fudgeA popular delicacy, chocolate fudge is the easiest thing to make.Mix one spoon of chocolate powder, two cups of castor sugar, one cup of white butter, 3/4th cup milk, and a few drops of vanilla essence.Boil it until the mixture thickens. Then, remove it from fire and beat with a wooden spoon until it is nearly cold. It should be very creamy when done.Next, pour the material on to a buttered plate or tin and allow it to set. Your chocolate fudge is now ready to be cut and eaten.",

    "title": "The Boy Who Could Do Nothing Right!",
    "article": "Do you know of anyone who stumbles on a flat stretch of road, or walks into chairs and tables all the time? I knew one such boy. His name was Tarun. I met him in the hill retreat of Shimla in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. I had gone there for a holiday some time ago.The Boy Who Could Do Nothing Right!For a nine-year-old Tarun was tall. Since he was much taller than his classmates, he would hunch his shoulders to appear smaller. His arms and legs were loose and he always seemed to have trouble walking straight. It seemed as if his arms and limbs were not ready to go along with the rest of the body. So much so that the joke in school was that no one knew whether Tarun was coming or going. On any given day there would be one or more bruises on his body from walking into table corners or closing the door on his hand. Prince of the Clumsy Kingdom was what everyone called him. Tarun was miserable.On a Sunday, unwilling to go out and face the teasing of the neighbourhood boys, Tarun sat at home flipping one television channel after another. As his hands tired of pressing a remote that had become very old, he stopped. It was a channel showing a bearded man in the dress of a sadhu doing unimaginable exercises. He lay down on his stomach and then, with his hands holding on to his ankles, lifted the upper part of his body as well as legs to form a boat shape. “This is the Dhanurasana, or the bow pose,” said the voice of the compere.Child performing yoga asanaThe bearded man had caught Tarun’s interest. He sat on the ground and tried to do the same. Wonder of wonders he could do it effortlessly. When his mother entered the room she almost dropped the tea cup in her hand in astonishment. Her clumsy boy and doing exercises that none of them could!Kid performing various yoga asanaThe news travelled like wildfire in the neighbourhood. The boys looked at Tarun with new respect. Old people came and ruffled his hair with affection. Tarun’s father took him to a yoga teacher so he could learn properly. Once the teacher got to know that for the first time in his life Tarun had found something he was good at, he was determined to help the boy.“My boy, what is it that you want to learn?” he asked Tarun.“I want to learn as much as is necessary for me to do what the other boys do – somersaults, jumps, even breakdance so that no one ever teases me again,” the boy replied.The teacher laughed and said, “Yoga for kids is what the sun is to the sunflower. It will make your body do things you could never dream of. It will sharpen your mind. It will make you see the whole world in a new light.”Now Tarun did not believe everything the teacher said. He was just hoping that yoga for kids could also cure him of his clumsiness and make him somersault like Jatin did. But as he started his yoga routine with his teacher, he felt himself changing.The teacher first made him do breathing exercises to energise his body. He said this was called Pranayama, exercises for the life force within each of us. Then he taught Tarun stretches, simple asanas or exercises like touching toes, bending sideways, twisting his spine, and finally, even the padmansana, the lotus pose. As his legs folded up and locked into the lotus pose, Tarun couldn’t believe his eyes. “Ma, Ma” he yelled. “Get a camera! See what I can do!” He could not contain his excitement.Within two months everyone was talking about the sea change in him. Tarun now walked straight, his stamina had increased, he felt confident enough to attempt anything and he could concentrate much better on studies.Best of all, no one called him the Prince of the Clumsy Kingdom any more.",

    "title": "The Boy who Lacked Sight but Had a Vision",
    "article": "It was like any other day in school for six-year-old George Abraham. He went to La Martinere school in Lucknow, where he lived with his aunt. The school was open to boys till the fourth standard.That day, as usual, the teacher found that the little boy was holding the book next to his nose. She complained and George had to undergo several eye tests. The doctors found that his retina was damaged beyond repair, and said he would lose most of his eyesight.George’s parents, who lived in Hubli, Karnataka, came to Lucknow to take him back with them. His father was an engineer with the government and was posted to remote places. That was in 1964.Thirty-four years later, in 1998, came his greatest moment of triumph. George Abraham, had successfully organised the World Cup Cricket for the Blind, in Delhi. Teams from New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan, England, Sri Lanka, South Africa and India participated in it. In 1999, Wisden, which is like the Bible of cricketers, mentioned his contribution to the sport. Cricketers like Steve Waugh and Sachin Tendulkar supported his cause, in television advertisements. The President of India gave away the trophy to the winning team.For the players it was sport as usual. And once the spectators had got used to the special rules like underarm bowling, it was a competitive game like any other. The cricket ball has ball bearings inside and thus makes a sound, enabling the players to bat, field and catch.George became known as the man who used the game of cricket to encourage a competitive spirit and confidence among the blind. He is the man who singlehandedly put cricket for the blind on the world map, literally. Since 1990, he has successfully organised cricket championships for the blind at the school level, and at the state level.His list of achievements is large. In 1996, he was one of the five Indians chosen to carry the relay torch at the Atlanta Olympics. Today, he conducts communication workshops for high-level executives in companies like WIPRO Infotech, among others. And for the past two years, he has been holding workshops for blind youth all over the country. His message to them is that they should try to be achievers in some field or the other. They should reject any gesture of charity. In 1993, he received the Sanskriti award. It was to recognise that he has the potential to do even greater things.If you ask him how he did all this, he mentions the five Ds: dream, desire to fulfil the dream, discipline, determination and dedication. But all this did not happen in one day.To learn about how it happened, it is necessary to go back to his childhood. Though the doctors had advised the boy’s parents to put him in a blind school, they chose to put him in a ‘normal’ school, the Kendriya Vidyalaya.That was the best thing they could have done. For, after making fun of him initially, George’s classmates realised that he was not only just like them, he was better at studies and sports than them. More importantly, he was willing to guide them. From then on, they read to George and he explained. It was a perfect give and take arrangement. That was the beginning of George’s journey to excellenceThe Boy who Lacked Sight but Had a VisionA star student throughout school and at the prestigious St Stephen’s College, George excelled in studies, music, debates as well as in state-level athletics. He feels that it was his mother’s confidence in his abilities that helped him come so far.But, he entered the darkest phase of his life after he finished college in 1980. His mother’s death left him shaken. For the first time, he felt that his lack of vision was a handicap in getting jobs. He was back in Kerala with his father, and depressed.Then, one day, at 4 am, he realised something: that he was the only one who could help himself. Borrowing Rs. 500 from his father, he came to Delhi, stayed with a friend in his hostel room and started looking for jobs in advertising. Having somehow got an appointment with the chairman of a big company, Advertising and Sales Promotion, George impressed him with his sheer confidence. The job was his! In 1984, he shifted to the advertising giant, Ogilvy and Mather, as copywriter.The turning point came in 1988. George was 29 years of age. He went to a blind school for the first time. He was horrified to see how blind young people with lesser handicaps than him had no confidence at all. For two years, he travelled on a grant provided by a non-governmental organisation to decide what he wanted to do.One day, he saw some blind children playing cricket in Dehradun. The ball had ball bearings inside. The competitive spirit was tremendous. That’s when he decided to use cricket to boost the competitive levels among the blind. It was also a way of telling the world to treat the blind as people with the potential to achieve anything. Like normal people.It is not surprising that Discovery Channel should have picked him as one of the Discovery people from India.“There is a lot of truth in the saying that when you give you receive in multiples of what you give,” says George. When he was 10, his mother once said that she believed he would write his autobiography. It was her confidence in him that has taken him this far, says George. And he is ready to travel further.(In the special articles under the Parenting section, you can find a thought-provoking article by George Abraham, on whether the blind constitute a liability or a potential resource to any society, and especially Indian society.)",

    "title": "The Cure is Laughter",
    "article": "It is not a new way of spreading happiness. The method has been practised for a while and has also been captured on celluloid by Hollywood in the film ‘Patch Adams’. In the film (based on a true story) Patch Adams is the name of a studentof medicine, who decides to use humour to help patients. The role was played by Robin Williams, Hollywood’s leading comedian.This technique has been adopted in Brazil, to great success. Members of the ‘Group of Frolic’ (Turma da Pholia) regularly visit hospitals to cheer patients in Rio de Janeiro. Their clowning around helps in the treatment, say doctors. While their methods might be somewhat unusual, a sound principle governs them: a good state of mind can increase the immunity of a patient and speed up recovery.The Cure is LaughterBut how do they bring about a good state of mind? By bringing theatre, music and poetry to people in hospitals, orphanages and asylums. “The reception we have been getting is wonderful. The reward for bringing a smile to the face of a child is well worth the effort that we put in,” says Micheli Bento Cortermani, a 16-year-old member of the group.The ‘Group of Frolic’ was founded in São Paulo two years ago. The group consists of 25 actors, clowns and musicians, between 16 and 30 years of age.“I have not done any scientific research on the subject but aftermembers of the group have visited the hospital, the patients acceptthe treatment more easily,” says a doctor.Some research on the subject has been done, though. Doctor SebastiãoCarlos Silva Jr, is a neurosurgeon (brain surgeon) at the Clinic of Happiness of theSchool of Medicine of São José do Rio Preto. He has writtenan entire article on various ways to handle pain.Members of bodies like the Clinic of Happiness, through their visits, try and forge close links with patients suffering from chronic pain. They do so by showing the patients how to breathe properly, and encouraging them to visualize and relax through the performances.These activities act on the emotions and imagination of those who are suffering. The connection thus formed between the body and the mind helps in reducing pain, says Carlos. For it’s known that the feeling that one is in pain is morewhen the person is scared, or sad, or lonely, or is suffering from a lack of sleep.The patients look forward to regular visits by members of the group(they visit at the same time every day) help in breaking monotony.“It is nice to have the same group of people coming regularlybecause patients, especially children, look forward to thesevisits,” says he.Members of the Clinic of Happiness go to five hospitals on a regular basis and collect money for work through the sale of postcards and T-shirts on street corners. They are thoroughly trained for the job, even not to be depressed while dealing with seriously-ill patients.In the city of São Paulo, another group called Doctor of Happiness (Doutores daAlegria) is also following the same technique to make patients happy. It does not work with volunteers though. Members of this group too visit hospitals at the same time on specific days of the week. They create a strong bond of friendship and trust with the patients.These groups are yet another testimony to the time-tested saying, that laughter can be the best medicine.",

    "title": "The Day Christ Died",
    "article": "As a child, I did not know the significance of Good Friday for Christians. For me, all it meant was a day off from school. One evening, I let it slip to a friend that I thought ‘Good’ Friday meant something good must have happened on this day.My friend Lorraine stared at me in astonishment. Then she told me that Good Friday is actually a day of mourning as Christ was crucified on that day.“Then what’s good about it?” I asked. She told me that Christ’s death symbolises the victory of good over evil, hence the ‘Good’. But I was more confused than ever, so she explained it to me.The Crucifixion of Christ is known as ‘Good’ Friday in the English language. Good Friday was originally God’s Friday just as good-bye was originally God be with ye. Over the years, it has evolved into Good Friday and good-bye respectively. The other reason why it is ‘Good’, is that on this day the Son of God sacrificed his life for the people.What were those times like? The vast Roman empire which ruled over ancient Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, was also reigning over Judea, Sameria and Palestine. Christ was born at a time when the Roman empire had become too vast and unwieldy. The people, especially in the outposts, were rebelling against its dominance.The Romans believed in many gods and even the divinity of the Roman emperor. There were those who resented this, like the Jews. Unrest marked many of the regions that came under the rule of the Romans, as a result.Jesus Christ’s ideas and teachings were aimed at reforming the Jewish faith, to which the people of Israel belonged. The man who was a carpenter by trade and had disciples from equally humble professions, gave the common people a sense of belonging. His message of equality gave them self respect.Some high officials and Jewish priests however, felt that he was trying to usurp their authority and mislead the people. They hatched a plot against Jesus with the help of one of his 12 apostles (leading disciples), named Judas.The Jewish authorities arrested Jesus for claiming to be the Son of God, as such a claim was against their religious teachings. Thereafter, Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor, Pilate, as only he could condemn anyone to death.Stained glass window depicting Jesus on the cross in the cathedral of Brussels. jorisvo / Shutterstock.comThe Jewish leaders told Pilate that Jesus was misleading the people, telling them not to pay taxes to the emperor, and claiming to be the Son of God. However, Pilate saw no reason to condemn him. But the priests argued that anyone claiming to be the King of Jews was a threat to the Roman empire and should be put to death.After questioning Jesus, the Governor still did not find him guilty, but to please the priests, he said he would have Jesus flogged and released. Jesus was made to wear a crown of thorns and mockingly addressed as ‘King of the Jews’.But the priests were not pleased. Once again, the Governor appealed to them saying that Christ had done no wrong. But when the clergy refused to agree, Pilate handed Jesus Christ to them to do as they wished. The high priests told him, “Let his blood be upon us and upon our children.”The crowd too demanded that Jesus should be crucified.Jesus was made to carry the heavy wooden cross on which he was to be nailed, while a group of his followers marched behind him. Jesus died in three hours and his followers buried him in a cave. It is believed that Jesus rose from his grave on the third day, which was a Sunday. That day is celebrated as Easter.Jesus’ death on the cross was followed by a round of persecution for the followers of Christ. The Roman authorities feared that this new religion would take strong root among the people and encourage them to protest against their rule. But in a few centuries, the Romans themselves had embraced Christianity.On Good Friday, the Christians recall the pain that Christ had to go through and observe a fast for the whole day.A wooden cross, representing the cross on which Christ was crucified, is displayed and worshipped during the religious service on Good Friday. One by one, the believers come and kiss it.",

    "title": "The Day Mother raised the Flag",
    "article": "On August 15, at the stroke of midnight, the Indian flag replaced the Union Jack of the British Empire. And millions of Indians went to sleep in a state of excitement. For, they would literally wake up in a free country. Among them was a five-year-old girl called Amrita Rangasami. She lived with four siblings and a young widowed mother, in a bylane of Madras (now Chennai).Sixty-year-old Amrita, a senior journalist and scholar, remembers the day clearly, as if it were yesterday.As the red letter day dawned, her mother put up the Indian tricolour atop their house. “All of us sat down with folded hands in absolute silence for two minutes, offering a tribute to all those who had laid down their lives and suffered in making our dreams come true,” says Amrita.Her mother had made kheer. “It was a grand meal just like it would be on any major festival,” remembers Amrita. All her school friends came home and tucked into the special meal.As they made their way to school, the streets were full of people saying ‘Jai Hind’ to each other. There were children everywhere. Everyone in the school bus, including the driver, conductor and children, had a smile that stretched from ear to ear. When they saw a truck filled with English soldiers they decided they could be rude that day, and so they all called them ‘white monkeys’.Houses and shops were lit up even during daytime. The people had gone absolutely mad with joy. “That joy on everyone’s face is the greatest memory of my childhood,” says Amrita. It was like a dream come true. Nobody could believe that they had finally got independence from British rule.The best part of it all was the fact that Governor Hope, a white man, was going to hoist the Indian flag in their school!As a small child Amrita recalls her mother’s strong belief in Gandhi’s ideas. “My mother was an active participant of the All India Women’s Conference, an organisation that was led by famous women freedom fighters who motivated women across the country to join the freedom movement. Her mother, too, started wearing khadi sarees in place of silk.“Every night before going to bed, mother used to make all of us sit with folded hands and silently pray for the health and well-being of the leaders who were in jail,” she recalls.“Right fom the childhood we followed Gandhiji’s philosophy of ‘White man quit India’,” says Amrita. As children they had mixed feelings about their white teachers as well. They respected them greatly as individuals and teachers, but also experienced anti-colonial feelings when they saw them.On growing up, Amrita went for further studies to the United States of America and returned to doing journalism and then branch into academic research as well. She is one of the foremost experts in what is called famine studies, in India today. Fifty four years after Independence, she is still uncovering the reasons behind the frequent droughts and famines that impoverish more and more people in rural India.The five-year-old in her is still alive today, searching for the causes that prevent a majority of Indians from getting freedom from hunger and poverty.",

    "title": "The Earth Drum",
    "article": "Imagine a pit covered with the skin of an ox. The hairy surface is on top and the hairy tail of the ox is still connected to the animal hide or skin. The cover is nailed to the ground at several places. And the ox tail becomes the drum stick. This is not a fantasy drum. It seems this was one of the earliest ways our ancestors in India made drums. It was called the bhoomi dundubhi or the earth drum.In countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, they made another kind of earth drum. They dug a deep hollow in the ground, covered it with planks on which women jumped in tune with the music.The Earth Drum []Our early ancestors had very clever ways of making drums. Sometimes, what they did was cut down a tree, and scoop out the wood inside. Just like the man at the ice cream shop takes out a scoop of ice cream from the container. The tree trunk became hollow. Then they covered it with animal skin, and hey presto! the forest came alive with the sound of the tree drum. The earliest drums probably stood like trees and were played on one side.If you want an idea of what the tree drum looked like, you must look at the standing drums from Andhra Pradesh. They are called the ronza and runza but are made of brass instead of wood. Some of the tree drums found in Africa and Mexico are as high as three metres! How do you think they are played?Wood drums are used even today. The kharram is played in Assam, the dhol is played in Andhra Pradesh. But these drums are not kept on the floor and are not so large.It is in Kerala that you may be able to see a descendant of the tree drum. Here coconut and palm trees are found in plenty. They are cut, made hollow from inside and then covered with leather.There was another kind of drum — the mud or clay drum. It not only looked like a mud vessel, it was a cooking and storing pot too! When our ancestors had to use them as drums, they would cover the vessels and start their rhythms.They even had the same words to describe the cooking vessel and the drum in several Dravidian languages.The words para, pare and pirai are used for drums as well as storage pots.The drums were made in familiar shapes — circular pots, shallow pans and long- necked jars. In India today, you can spot the pot-like dardura, the pan-like tasha and the jar shaped tumbaknari.Our ancestors liked mud because it was easier to make shapes out of it than out of wood. It was easier to use, but also easy to break. Though wood and clay drums continued to be made, in time, humans started making metal drums.",

And the emperor could not believe his eyes at the sight of this unusual, striped animal. So surprised was he that he wrote about it in his memoirs. He spoke of it as a very strange animal. So strange that some people imagined that the animal’s stripes had been painted!The emperor decided to find out whether the zebra was indeed coloured or not.The Emperor and the Zebra []After much investigation, he made it public that the zebra, too, was a creature created by god. The stripes were natural, they had not been painted upon!The emperor then asked one of the two most famous artists in his empire to paint the animal. Ustad Mansur was the artist. Most Mughal paintings have great details of the rich flora and fauna of the time.",

    "article": "Akbar was three years old in 1545. He was then staying with his uncle Kamran. On a special day, there was a feast. And Kamran had bought a kettle drum for his son, Ibrahim Mirza. Akbar took a fancy to it and decided he must have it.Ibrahim Mirza, who was older than Akbar, was not in a mood to part with his toy. So he set a condition. He suggested a wrestling match. Whoever won would take the toy. The future emperor agreed at once. One doesn’t know if he gave any thought to the fact that his cousin was older and physically bigger than him. He rolled up his sleeves and prepared for the wrestling bout.The match began. And soon it became apparent that Ibrahim Mirza was no match for his younger cousin. Putting his hand behind Mirza’s waist, Akbar lifted his cousin up and then flung him on the ground. It was as clear a victory as could be. The kettle drum was his. And for the next few moments, he drummed away madly&mldr;Much later, when Akbar became emperor, the story of his life was written by his biographer Abul Fazl. And when Abul Fazl wrote about this incident, he wrote about in glowing terms! He saw the incident as a sign from the heavens that the child was a future emperor. The fact that he wanted the kettle drum surely meant that Akbar would do deeds that would make people celebrate his achievements! The fact that the young Akbar managed to defeat his elder and stronger cousin meant that he was being supported by a divine power, said Fazl.What do you think?",

    "article": "Shooting ‘Shores of Silence’, was probably more exciting than shooting a high-voltage action thriller for Mike Pandey and his two crewmembers. The small fishing boat that they rode the high seas in, was tossed by huge waves like a cork, threatening their life and equipment several times. But the three hung on, determined to shoot the sequence that was to be the highlight of the film – the capturing and slaughtering of giant whale sharks.“We had no state-of-the art equipment. Not even high-resolution lenses that take long-distance shots. So, our only alternative was to move dangerously close to the creatures (about 20-30 feet away) and take some good quality shots”, says Mike, explaining the reason behind their adventurous move.But the efforts paid off. Mike’s film, the first Indian film to document the mindless massacre of these gentle creatures of the sea, won the world’s most prestigious award for ‘green’ films, at Bristol. Mike won the Wildscreen Panda Award, also known as the Green Oscars, reports ‘The Hindustan Times’.Mike had won the award once earlier. He won it for a 1994 film titled ‘The Last Migration – Wild Elephant Capture at Sarjuga’. It was the first Asian film to win a Wildscreen Panda.‘Shores of Silence’ is a 25-minute docudrama that took three agonizing years to complete. It was made on a shoestring budget of US$ 50,000 as compared to half a million to a million dollars that a foreign crew would spend. It was pitted against 478 mega-budget entries that had been entered by the likes of the British Broadcasting Corporation, National Geographic and Discovery.But the jury, instead of getting carried away by the superior technology of the other films, decided to award Mark’s film for the sensitive way in which it tackles the tragedy of the whale sharks, which are being hunted down for their blubber, oil and skin.Mark’s interest in wildlife began as a child in Nairobi, Kenya. This African country is known for its scenic beauty and abundant wildlife. The house he lived in, was located in the backyard of Nairobi’s famous National Park. He remembers going out on long walks with his father and brother, and being awed by the magnificence of the country and its fresh natural beauty.So when he received his first Kodak camera as a gift, Mike was as delighted as a little boy with his new toy. He could now capture the fascinating surroundings around him on film, with his camera.His childhood love proved enduring for this unusual man who, took his first name (Mike) from a character he played as a schoolboy, a detective called Michael Hammer.Mike went on to learn film direction and cinematography, at the London School of Films. He came back to India in 1970, where he founded Riverbank Studios. His other films include ‘Honey Hunters of the Blue Mountains’ and ‘The Living Fossil: Indian Horseshoe Crab’– poetic names thought up by someone who could see the inner beauty of nature. “I sense a harmony, a symmetry in nature, even in a blade of grass. That’s why I feel outraged when I see man entering into a conflict with it,” he says.Conviction and not profit lies at the root of Mike’s work. He has already pledged forty per cent of the proceeds from the sale of his film, to ‘Earth Matters Foundation’, a non-profit organisation that deals with environmental issues. The Foundation’s current campaign is to seek a ban on the slaughter of whale sharks. The foundation does provide alternatives to fishermen whose livelihood depends on the slaughter of these whale sharks and sale of products derived from it.",

    "article": "In 1981, Invalappil Mani Vijayan was 12 years old. He sold cold drinks at a football stadium near his home in Thrissur, Kerala, to earn some money for his family. Today he is not only the captain of the Indian football team, he has started a coaching centre at the same football stadium. He wants to help youngsters like him who have dreams but very few ways of making them come true.The five feet ten inches tall Vijayan is one of the best goal scorers in Indian football today. He holds the record for the fastest goal in the world. He is the sole Indian player to have scored two international hat-tricks for India. The football player has been selected as India’s best player of the year three times.The good-natured Vijayan also has had a film made on him. No wonder he has become a larger than life hero in his home state of Kerala.Vijayan dreamt his first dreams in a thatched hut. Born on April 25, 1969, he comes from a very poor family in Thrissur. His father was a farm labourer who survived on daily wages. Vijayan did not wear shoes till the age of 12.As fate would have it, he lived very near the football stadium. On match days, he would sell cold drinks and earn some money for the family. But, in his spare time, the 12-year-old would play with an old ball in the company of the other boys who worked with him.Luckily for Vijayan, Kerala had a football scheme and he was enrolled in a three-year camp. It was at the camp that his talent developed.He was at the right time at the right place. Coaches of football teams trying to spot talented youngsters often came to the camp. In 1986-87, when the Kerala Police coaches came, they were impressed with Vijayan. They took him on. And now he had a regular income to take home.Vijayan played for the Kerala Police for four years. In 1991, the rich Calcutta football club, Mohun Bagan, picked him up. They paid him hundreds of thousands of rupees each year. Vijayan had become one of India’s top players. In the same year, Vijayan also played for India for the first time. He showed many skills: he could dribble and pass the ball at the right time. He could also pick up passes accurately. That is why he is seen as one of India’s all-time bests.From 1991 till 1998, Vijayan was taken on by one prestigious club after another. JCT Mills, Phagwara (Punjab), FC Kochin club (Kerala) and Mohun Bagan were some of them. At one stage, he was earning almost Rs. 4 million ($93,023) per year. He returned to his home state Kerala last year.Vijayan, who is planning to retire soon, has started a football academy in the city of Thrissur, where he was born. He has another dream now: to give back something to the game that has brought him success and happiness. He plans to coach youngsters. Who knows, he may just succeed in making the dreams of some boy come true. As his dream came true for him.",

    "title": "The First Notes of Mozart",
    "article": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lived just 35 years. But he filled those years so totally with 626 musical works that the world today recognises him as one of the greatest composers ever. Among his works were 50 symphonies and 19 operas, including much-loved works like The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute.Mozart was born in the Austrian city of Salzburg, known for its salt mines, in 1756. His father, Leopold, was the choirmaster to the Archbishop of Salzburg.It was while Leopold was giving lessons to his older daughter Maria Anna that he noticed that little Nannerl, as the family called Mozart, was totally enchanted by the music. By the age of five, he could play long pieces without a flaw and even create his own shorter compositions.A letter from the Salzburg court trumpeter to Maria Anna in April 1972 recalls this scene. Leopold, on his return from a church service, found four-year-old Mozart very busy with a pen.“What are you doing?” asked Leopold.“Writing a concerto for the clavier (an early keyboard musical instrument). It will be done soon,” replied Mozart.“Let me see it,” said Leopold.Mozart responded: “It’s not finished yet.”When Leopold picked up the sheet of paper, he found a scribble of musical notes, most of them covered with inkblots. That’s because Mozart dipped his pen to the bottom of the inkwell every time he needed to, so that inkblots fell on the paper each time. But the boy wiped his palm over it and kept writing, so keen was he on completing the concerto.After he’d read the piece through, Leopold noted that it was so difficult that no one in the world could play it.But Mozart said, “That is why it is a concerto. It must be practised till it is perfect.” And then the little one began to show his father how to play it!In 1792, Leopold took Mozart to the court in Vienna, the Austrian capital, to play. This was the first stop of a tour that took them around the courts of Europe for the next three-and-a-half years. Soon, Mozart was the most famous child prodigy in Europe.When he played, Mozart’s delicate face was dead serious. But during concert breaks, he behaved just as a child of his age probably would. He was even seen running around a royal court with a stick between his legs, pretending that it was a horse!In Europe, city after city sang the praises of the young Mozart. At Bologna in Italy, he was made a member of the famous Philharmonic Academy – though officially only those over 20 could be admitted. In Rome, Pope Clement XIV decorated him with the Order of the Golden Spur. At Milan, he wrote his first opera, Mithridates, which was composed so quickly that Mozart’s tender fingers hurt!But what was Mozart like at home? When he was about eight, Leopold fell ill with a bad throat ailment in London. The children were forbidden to make a noise, even to play a piano, until he was better. To keep his itching fingers busy, Mozart used music in a different way. He composed his first symphony – K 16 – for an entire orchestra!Until he was about ten, Nannerl hated the sound of the horn. When it was played solo, he shuddered. Leopold wanted to cure his son of this fear, so he asked Maria Anna to blow a horn towards Mozart. But he turned pale at the very sound and would have fainted, had she not stopped at once. Luckily, she did.On one occasion, two archduchesses were leading little Mozart up to the Austrian empress. He slipped and fell because the floor of the court chamber was very slippery due to polish. One of the duchesses, Marie Antoinette – who later became the queen of France – lifted the boy up and consoled him. In response, Mozart wiped his tears away and said to her, “You are very kind. I will marry you.”Later, her mother asked Mozart what made him say these words. He said, rather solemnly, “From gratitude. She was so good, but her sister wasn’t concerned about my fall in the least.”Today, all of Salzburg seems like Mozart’s town. Its dramatic cupolas and spires seem to call out his name. The house where he was born is now a famous museum, a shrine for music lovers. The city even hosts a Mozart Week every year, when the master composer’s works are played.Mozart started young in the world of music. But his first notes of promise still ring true in our ears.",

    "title": "The Girl who Squeezed a Peacock",
    "article": "Last year, a strange thing happened at a zoo in Beijing, China’s capital. When the day started, no one had any idea of what would happen some time later. As usual, there were many visitors to the zoo, especially children.All of a sudden, a six-year-old girl caught hold of a peacock and squeezed it hard. She said she would free the bird only if her mother agreed to buy a Barbie doll for her. Her mother, who wanted the bird to remain alive, said yes. A Chinese journalist called Wen Chihua wrote about this in a newspaper called Terra Viva.Why did the girl do such a thing? Well, there are many who feel that very often Chinese children do not get to see nature in all its forms. Especially children living in cities, who do not realise the importance of living in tune with the environment. Most of them live in small matchbox- like houses with hardly any greenery around.Parents also get into another habit, when they take children to the zoo or to the aquaria. While showing an animal to the children, they talk about its value as a food item, rather than as an animal with many other roles in the environment.How would it be if we thought of fish chops and the proteins they contain, every time we saw a fish. Or, if the sight of a turtle made us think of turtle meat and how it could make us live longer! The Chinese believe that eating turtle meat could help them live longer.Some years back, a group of Japanese and Chinese children attended a summer camp. The difference between Chinese and Japanese children was very interesting. The Japanese children put up tents on their own while the Chinese children just watched along with their parents.When they went out on a nature walk, the children found some ostrich eggs. While the Japanese children made nests for the eggs and kept them carefully, the Chinese children did something very different. They liked to break the ostrich eggs.Why do they behave like this? This is a question many Chinese are asking today. But now they think they know what the problem is.One of the problems is that for about 25 years, Chinese governments have had a rule that every family must have only one child. They did this because they felt that China’s population was growing too fast. Families that had more than one child got less benefits when it came to getting government houses or jobs.So, most children grow up lonely and needing warmth. Even squeezing animals becomes a way of getting in touch with others around them. And since most of them do not ever come in contact with nature, they often become cruel to animals. Or they break things around them, and get involved in fights with other children. It is because they do not know better.As a result, adults have started thinking of the ways in which they can learn to think of nature and animals in a positive way, so that children too do the same.",

But I want to see something different today. Athens, here I come!My machine says we have reached the Athens of 2005 years ago (5th century BC). I stretch myself and walk out of the machine. There is a large group of men chatting and laughing in a shop. It’s a barber’s shop! If our Indian barber shops are any indication then these barbers’ shops must be the place where men exchange the news and gossip of the day – whether it is about politics or sports, or even philosophy. Yes! My pocket guide on ancient Greece tells me it is true.The men are wearing long tunics that reach their ankles. Some of them are wearing dull colours. They seem to be ordinary people, without rank or wealth. Others have gold or silver brooches on their tunics and the colours of their dresses are bright, so it is obvious they must be the rich ones. And what’s this? Men walking down the street wearing big hats. The guide book says it is called “petasos” and that the ancient Greeks invented the broad brimmed hat. And I thought it was the Mexicans!The women are wearing short tunics. Their borders are embriodered. Some of them are wearing a belt. It’s called “peplose”. They look very fashionable.A couple dressed in old greek styleThe ones with the least bit of clothing are the slaves – only a loin cloth.As for the hairstyle, both men and women have their hair long and are wearing headbands. Some of the women have their hair held up with a scarf or a ribbon.There is a group of old people sitting and engrossed in a serious discussion. All the oldies have long pointed breads. Young men are o the other hand are clean shaven.Hair, hair&mldr;Am I forgetting something? Oh gosh! I was supposed to go for a hair cut, to the saloon. I had better rush back.Home to the web and the booksThe ancient Greeks could buy clothes in the “Agora”, as they called the marketplace, but they were expensive. So most families, rather women, made their own clothes out of linen or wool. Then they dyed them a bright colour, or kept them bleached white. The rich always do things their own way – they had their clothes made female slaves.",

    "title": "The Joy of Flying",
    "article": "Come Independence Day and the markets are flooded with kites. The sky looks like an ocean swarming with tiny tadpoles swimming across from one place to the other. Colourful tadpoles, though!Although kite flying has been popular in India for hundreds of years, historians believe that kite flying originated in China almost 3,000 years ago. There are many stories, which talk about the origin of kites.There was a king in China who asked his army men to tie him to a kite and fly him off to the enemy’s territory. The moment he reached above enemy territory, he shouted out that if anyone came out of their palace they would be killed.Hearing this “voice from above” all the soldiers ran away and there was no one to fight the next day. Many other myths exist but that’s not surprising since people in nearly half the countries on this earth fly kites.The earliest kites were made from bamboo and silk. Now they are made with thin paper, plastic, cotton, silk and many other materials. Various kite-flying organisations all over the world organise festivals to create a strong kite flying community.The most recent festival was held in Indonesia last month wherein teams from Japan, China and Thailand participated.In India, one can get kites throughout the year but there are certain months when kite flying is especially popular. For example, in August, during the festivals of Raksha-Bandhan and Teej, and in January on Makar Sankranti, they are sold in large numbers.Makar Sankranti marks the end of a long winter, a time when the earth enters the constellation of Makara or Capricorn. It is one of the most popular days for kite enthusiasts in India.The famous Desert Kite Festival at Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur (Rajasthan) is held between January 11 and 14, to coincide with Makar Sankranti. Teams from all over the world come together for kite making, kite flying, and kite fighting competitions.As children and adults in terraces of houses shout encouragingly “Woh Kata!\", the kites take centrestage. A wide variety of kites can be seen in the sky. From simple diamond shaped kites to designer ones, they all try to soar to unimaginable heights.While the kites of Rampur, Lucknow and Moradabad in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh are said to be the best, manjha, the thread used to fly the kite, is usually made in another city of Uttar Pradesh, namely Bareilly. Manjha is made by coating the thread with glass powder to make it sharp.But true artistry lies in making kites. Khan Saheb who makes kites as a part of his traditional family business, and shuttles between Rampur and Delhi, says “Din mein hum 50-60 saadi patange bana lete hain ya phir 4-5 janwar wali.” (In a day we make 50-60 plain kites or about four to six designer ones with animal patterns.) Usually designer kites are made to order, as they are more expensive.But for the child on a terrace, armed with a simple diamond-shaped kite, a spool of thread and a bit of precious sharp manjha, kite flying is one of the cheapest ways to have a day full of excitement. On a good day, a little champ could bring in a few free kites after hectic battles in the sky. On a bad day, it is time to chase any fallen kite that hasn’t been claimed yet. Either way, the fun never ends.",

    "article": "Children are always asking questions, like ‘Why is the sky blue’, or ‘Why do we have only one nose’. And sometimes they also open up things like clocks to understand how they work. Emperor Akbar was also like that — always wanting to know this or that. He continued to ask such questions even after becoming the emperor.Once he asked a very interesting question. How do babies learn to speak? Was it by listening to people talk? What if a child grew up in a place where there was no one to talk to? Would the baby learn to speak then? It was Akbar’s view that children learnt to speak by hearing people’s conversations. He decided to check it out.He built a hostel in a place where nobody lived. And then some new born babies were kept in that hostel. The hostel was guarded round the clock. Sometimes wet nurses were allowed to go in and be with the babies. Only those who were dumb, were chosen. The hostel got the name of ‘Gung Mahal’ (the palace of the dumb). Some years went by.One day, Akbar visited the hostel. The children were grown up now. They were about four years old. And all they could do was to speak with their hands, not their mouth. They behaved like dumb children. Akbar had finished his experiment.",

    "title": "The Kite-Maker",
    "article": "The night was pitch dark. A street lamp shone dimly, creating pools of shadows along a tiny lane in Bareilly city. Sitting beneath the light was Imran. His nimble fingers were busy pasting thin sheets of coloured paper. He was making a kite.Even though he could barely see, he didn’t fumble in his work. He could make these kites blindfolded now. At 10, he was an old hand at the craft, having started making kites when he was just six years old – the kites that Bareilly, in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh, is so well known for.At first, Imran used to help his mother crush the glass that is used to make the ‘manjha’ or the thread used to fly the kite. To make the manjha strong, finely ground glass is mixed with glue and applied on the thread by hand.In the morning, along with seven other boys, Imran would apply the thick, sticky glue onto the manjha, which was tied across poles in a courtyard.The process was gruelling and risky. Since the glass was not often ground finely, it would leave deep cuts on the palms of the boys. But often there was no medicine to stop the bleeding. The wounds were wrapped up in dirty bandages and left to heal. All these young employees carried scars.But they couldn’t stop because that would mean losing a day’s wages.Unlike the other boys, Imran’s work didn’t end by nightfall. Late at night, after dinner, when everyone else had retired for the day, Imran sat under the lamppost and made kites.He didn’t mind the pain or the long, difficult hours. He knew his family depended on him and he couldn’t let them down. He had three younger brothers and a sister. His father suffered from tuberculosis and usually stayed home. His mother helped to crush glass but earned very little. It was not enough to feed the entire family.Over the last few days, work had suddenly become hectic. The kite-maker or ‘Ustad’ wanted hundreds of kites ready before Independence Day (August 15) when the skies are shot with colour. It is a day when children and adults of all sizes fly kites.The kites had to be sent to various cities and towns and there was little time to spare. The boys worked round the clock, often missing their meals.But now the kites were ready — red, blue, green, purple, burgundy and bright yellow. The yard where the kites were kept looked like a garden and Imran felt proud of his work. Although he couldn’t afford to buy any, he knew many others like him would fly his kites and so, the sky would be his.Sitting in a corner, his heart soared imagining the experience — little boys shouting gleefully as they cut each other’s kites, shouting ‘woh kaata’ (there! The kite is cut!). Their joy shone in his eyes.A hand on his shoulder brought him back from his dream to reality. It was the Ustad. His wrinkled face had an understanding look as if he knew what Imran was thinking. He thrust some notes at Imran, his extra earnings for the work he had put in these last few days.Overjoyed, Imran snatched the money and began to run across to his mother. It was time for celebrations. He knew his mother would have cooked special dishes for the family and he didn’t want to miss the feast.Suddenly, the ustad called out his name. For a moment, Imran was afraid he would take the money back. Fearfully he looked behind his shoulder. The Ustad was holding out a kite — red, yellow, purple! Happy Independence Day, he said.",

    "title": "The Language of a Cat",
    "article": "The poet Carl Sandburg wrote, “The fog comes in on little cat feet.” So do a large number of our words and expressions. Let’s think of the cats that run and leap and pounce and slink and purr and meow through the English language.There are a number of explanations for the phrase, “it’s raining cats and dogs”? Cats and dogs were closely associated with the rain and wind in the western mythology. Dogs were often pictured as the attendants of Odin, the storm god, and cats were believed to cause rain.But the true source appears to be quite literal. During heavy rains in the 17th century England some city streets became raging rivers of filth carrying many drowned cats and dogs.Not long ago in England, a city dweller had to be careful of buying a pig from a villager who would keep it in a sack. Very often, cunning villagers intent on duping the customer substituted the pigs with cats. And when the city dweller opened the bag, he would literally let the cat out of the bag, revealing the crafty farmer’s secret.When a cat is attacked by a dog or other animals, it aggressively arches its back, a response that suggested the phrase ‘to get one’s back up’ to describe humans aroused to anger.On the other paw, cats are often pictured as grinning. Charles Ludwidge Dodgson, best known to the world as Lewis Carroll, popularised the Cheshire cat in his classic, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). In the story, the Cheshire cat in the story gradually fades from Alice’s view, but the smile manages to hang in the air magically.An old British expression advised that “There’s more than one way of killing a cat than choking it with cream.” The expression was used to describe a foolish action since cats like cream and would never choke to death on it. Gradually, this expression gave way to yet another colourful one – there’s more than one way to skin a cat.The Language of a CatCats have long been regarded as tenacious survivors because of their careful, suspicious nature and because they are supple animals that can survive high falls. This could be the reason for the Old English saying that a cat has nine lives. This phrase can be traced back well before the 16th century.You might have asked a person who has been rendered speechless if a cat has got her tongue. This phrase refers to a form of punishment in the Mid-east, several centuries ago, when the tongue of a person who lied was cut off and fed to the ruling king’s pets, often cats.Here’s one that bothered me for years. Which cat was killed by curiosity? What was it curious about and how did it meet its end?Actually, this is a case of a phrase that has changed over the years. The original saying was ‘care kills a cat,’ meaning that cats seemed to be very cautious and careful.Then came another human twist to the ‘tail’ that cats were nervous creatures and nervousness as we all know, leads to eventual death. So, over the years the definition of the word ‘care’ changed and, eventually, the word care in the phrase was replaced with curiousity.Catcall is an easy one. It dates back to the theatre in Shakespeare’s age. Instead of booing, the gentlemen made noises that sounded like an auditorium full of cats.All these phrases are still very much in use, along with modern-day phrases. Remember the girl in the previous class, who used to be quite a ‘cat’? Being a cat or cool cat implies that the person is smart or street smart – like a cat.If you knew the origin of all these cat phrases then you are truly the cat’s whiskers.",

    "article": "Nirmala is a primary school teacher in the Rajiv Gandhi Shiksha Mission for universal education, in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. Every day at 11.30 am, her husband Malkhan Singh, drops her to the school in an autorickshaw. In the evening, at 4 pm, he is there to pick her up as well. Slung across his shoulders at all times, is a rifle during these rides.So, what is so unusual about this couple?The answer is their past. Rather, his past.Twenty years ago, Malkhan Singh was a feared dacoit who led a gang of 80 men to rob and kill people in the Chambal valley, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Before becoming a dacoit he had been the village head or sarpanch from Bilao — his village in Bhind. Revenge had driven him to the other side of the law. Soon, he was carrying a reward of Rs. 200,000 on his head.Nirmala was a college girl whose cousin Kokh Singh was a member of Malkhan’s gang. “My aunt always sent me with goodies and foodstuff for him whenever we got news that the gang was nearby,” says Nirmala. And that was how they met.In 1984, Malkhan and his men laid down their arms in surrender and took the first step towards leading a law-abiding life. It was in jail that Malkhan decided to marry Nirmala. His first wife had died a little while ago.The two waited a year before getting married on April 17, 1985. Malkhan spent the next five years in Gwalior Special Jail where Nirmala went to visit him everyday.Today Malkhan is a changed man. He stood as a candidate in one election and failed. But he is happier than ever before. “I have a home, settled children and an educated teacher wife,” he says.",

    "article": "While working on a machine in a sericulture unit in Karnataka, a little girl was severely injured in the head. Sericulture is the art of raising silkworms to obtain raw silk. The incident ocurred in the Ramanagaram-Channapatna taluk (a group of villages make a taluk) of Karnataka, where there are many such units.The little girl is one of hundreds of thousands of children employed in the sericulture industry in the state. Owners of sericulture units prefer children over adults for the work.The traumatised life of these children is the subject of a documentary film,Inde Baalya or Childhood Now, in Kannada and English. A Mangalore-based film-maker, Natesh Ullal, and his wife Vidya Dinker, have made the film, said a report in The Hindu.The documentary is based on a study carried out by MAYA (Movement for Alternatives and Youth Awareness). MAYA is a non-governmental organisation working on issues that affect children and youth.A sericulture unit is extremely cramped as there is very little space to work in. Imagine a narrow matchbox-like space. That and the low height of the bobbin, the cylinder or spindle on which the thread is wound, makes it difficult for a grown-up person to work.Women working on weaving machine using silkworm cocoons in a silk factory. Elena Mirage / Shutterstock.comThe child worker is made to stand with her back to the wall with the machine in front of her. She is almost trapped under the machinery, as if she were standing in a narrow cage. Now you know why owners of such units prefer children to work on the machine.The reeler, the person who turns the wheel, throws cocoons to her every now and then. The child creates silk from the cocoon.There’s another reason why children are hired in the sericulture industry. Child labour is far cheaper than adult labour. And sericulture requires a lot of work to be done by hands and much less by machine.Children work as turners, pupae pickers, helpers and even cocoon cooks in these units. The common illnesses among them are asthma, fungal infection, malnutrition and anaemia.The most challenging task for Ullal and his team was to film the children working in the most awful conditions.They knew that if the mill owners came to know the real purpose of their work, they’d never allow them to film it. So, the team pretended to be interested only in the process of producing the silk. That way, they could enter the premises and still film the work that little children were made to do, and also how they were made to do it.While camerapersons operated the camera, Ullal and Dinker spoke continuously to the mill owner in order to divert his attention.",

    "title": "The Stockholm Effect",
    "article": "Sweden lies in the Scandinavian Peninsula in northern Europe, with Norway to the west and Finland to the northeast. Stockholm, its permanent capital since 1523, is located at the junction of Lake Mälar (Mälaren) and Salt Bay (Saltsjön), an arm of the Baltic Sea, opposite the Gulf of Finland. Due to its location, built as it is upon numerous islands, Stockholm is regarded as one of the most beautiful capital cities in the world.The Swedish capital, Stockholm, has puzzled people for ages. Its folks once thought of it as Europe’s largest small town. But over the past 15 years, it has grown to be the continent’s smallest large city, with a population of about 1.6 million people.Stockholm is built at the point where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea. Its 14 islands are connected by 53 bridges.The best way to see the city is on a tourist boat. As the boat speeds over the sun-spotted waters, we notice that boats of every imaginable shape and size bob in waters in front of the gabled buildings that sit comfortably along the island edges.The city tour takes you to the spot where former Swedish Premier Olof Palme was gunned down and a glimpse of the royal family’s summer residence. You can glimpse the long queues of people waiting to go into the Riksdag or the Swedish Parliament. Though Sweden has been ruled by King Carl Gustav XVI since 1973, its democracy functions well. Today, Sweden’s elected government has more women than men, and equal numbers of men and women hold seats in its Riksdag.Stockholm, in many ways, is typical of Sweden. When we think of Sweden, so many images float into our minds – the image of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, who also instituted the annual Nobel Prizes in various fields; or the pop group ABBA, which topped the pop charts for months in the 1970s; or the Pippi Longstocking books by Astrid Lindgren, about a nine-year-old girl who has wild adventures with a horse and a monkey for company; or Bjorn Borg, the great tennis star of the modern era, who won five straight Wimbledon titles.Most Swedes have a wonderful sense of humour. They laugh when foreigners confuse their country with Switzerland. Or when people lump all of Scandinavia – Denmark, Norway and Sweden – into a single country.Of course, Sweden does share many traditions with Denmark and Norway. Take Christmas in Stockholm. Christmas in the Nordic countries (as the Scandinavian countries are called) includes a rice pudding called julgrot, which has an almond in it. Whoever gets the almond is said to have good luck all year long. The Christmas meal normally includes other typical Swedish dishes such as meatballs and pickled herring.In Sweden, Christmas begins on St. Lucia’s day or December 13, when the oldest daughter of the family – dressed in white with a wreath on her head, bearing seven lighted candles – serves each person coffee and buns in bed. Swedish children believe that a bright elf named jultomten brings them gifts from Santa on Christmas Eve.Though Sweden is one of the largest countries in Europe, pine forests amidst beautiful lakes and snow-capped mountains cover 90 percent of its land. Only 10 percent is populated and farmed. Visitors can picnic on pretty stretches of land, as long as they don’t disturb those living there or litter the place.In Stockholm, it’s easy to see that Swedes are among the richest people in Europe. They have more cars, cell phones and TV sets per head than other Europeans. Education in Sweden is free. Old people, widows and orphans are looked after by the government, and most medical services are free. When a baby is born in Sweden, the State pays its parents a large portion of their salaries so that they are able to stay at home for the first 15 months of its life.But to return to Stockholm, which became the capital in 1523. It was probably founded in the early 1250s by a Swedish leader named Birger Jarl. He built a castle in the area that is now Gamla Stan or the old town, the heart of the city.The Gamla Stan, with its cobbled streets, is beautiful by the light of ancient lamps at night. We found tall, blonde-haired Swedes walking and joking along the waterfront by moonlight, or chatting on the wrought iron benches in its squares. All around them are drinking houses or pubs, where Swedes shout ‘Skol!’ as they raise their wine glasses.Though Bangladeshis today sell postcards with Trolls and Pakistanis hawk T-shirts with Vikings on them in the heart of Stockholm’s broad avenues, the essence of the city remains Swedish. Swedes still stride past the old buildings and new skyscrapers daily, greeting friends in the streets with “Hei!”That’s the word to watch for as a visitor in Stockholm. It’s the easiest way to make friends in the Swedish capital.",

    "title": "The Story of Indian Bronzes",
    "article": "One of the most beautiful figures in Indian sculpture is that of Lord Shiva dancing the Ananda Tandava or dance of joy, one leg raised high, his face very calm, as he destroys all life until new life is born once more. Looking at the divine dancer, we can almost hear the sound of the damru or small drum that he holds in one fist.The bronze figure of this god is often seen in museums, in homes, even at crafts bazaars. So are crafted figures of Shiva and Parvati, Buddhist saints, or even Rama, Sita and Lakshman.But is there a story behind Indian bronze sculptures? The earliest in India was probably the metal figure of the dancing girl found at Mohenjo-Daro. Remember it from the history textbooks?As ages passed by, the history of Indian bronzes came to be linked with the south. The art of creating the bronzes flourished in the Southern kingdoms of the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, the Cholas of Thanjavur, the Pandyas of Madurai and the Vijayanagar rulers.Though often referred to as ‘bronzes,’ these statues seldom use the alloy of copper and tin that makes up bronze because tin was not said to be pure enough for statues of the gods and goddesses. Usually, pure copper or brass (an alloy of copper and zinc) was used for metal casting. Later, the mix of the alloy changed to 20 parts of copper, to one of brass and one of white lead.Who were the people who made these statues? And how did they do it?In ancient India, the sthapati or metalworker was honoured by kings and commoners alike. His skills were often revered as a gift from the gods, even finding a mention in the Yajur Veda.The sthapati usually cast his bronzes through the cire perdue, which is the French term for the ‘lost wax’ process. He first modelled a simple figure in wax, including details of the body. Next, a special clay mixture, including rice husks and cow dung, was applied over the wax in thicker and thicker layers. The clay form had openings at the top and the bottom.What were the openings for? The clay model was heated, so that the wax drained out from the bottom. While this happened, liquid metal alloy was poured into the model from the top, filling each nook and cranny of it. Later, the clay coating was broken, and the metal cast taken out. At this stage, it’s still not quite perfect. So, the sthapati has to chisel it by hand with simple tools. Last of all, the figure is polished or burnished to give it the sheen that we look for in bronzes.Strangely, the bronze-casters at centres like Swamimalai and Salem in Tamil Nadu today still use methods similar to those of the ancient Indian sthapatis, probably even as far back as Mohenjo-Daro.Dr. R Nagaswami, a former Director of Archaeology in Tamil Nadu, shared some fascinating stories about ancient bronzes with us.“A sthapati would first make a wax model, and take it out in a procession through the main street of his village or town,” Dr. Nagaswami reveals. “Only after the local people had approved of it could he cast it in bronze. He wouldn’t allow people to watch as he worked on figures of gods or goddesses, fearing it might bring him ill luck.”“If the sthapati did a fine bronze, the king would reward him with land and money,” he adds. “The king made sure that the best sthapatis never lacked the money or the leisure to create beautiful works. The creators read poetry, watched dancers, and even listened to classical music. It was essential to know these in order to create superb bronzes.”Do we know the names of these sthapatis? “We don’t have the name of even one bronze sculptor,” Dr. Nagaswami replies. “These idols were made for worship, so they didn’t write on them. But we do have the names of donors inscribed, even on a 915 A.D. image of Parvati. And yet, the name of the architect of the great temple at Thanjavur was found inscribed within it!”Did the sthapati always work alone? “In ancient times, the craft was handed down from father to son or other relatives. It was usually kept within the family,” he tells us. “We don’t know if more than one person worked on a bronze. That’s why, even today, historians still don’t refer to each bronze caster by name. Instead, they just call them the Kumbakonam school or the Tanjore school.”Each bronze holds within itself so many secrets and stories. Will we think about these nameless sthapatis the next time we come face to face with a beautiful Indian bronze figure?India Feature Service",

    "title": "The Story-tellers",
    "article": "What could be a better way to get to know a country than through its folk-tales and stories? And if you love collecting stories anyway, as Madhu Gurung does, nothing could be more wonderful. Here, Madhu, presently based in Myanmar’s capital, Yangon, talks about the Myanmarese duo of mother and daughter who have enlivened her days by weaving tales even as they help her with her domestic chores. Madhu shares the magic of those story-telling sessions in the following anecdote:Fatima is 56 years old. Like the rest of her brood I too, lovingly call her Amma or mother. The other is Amma’s 26-year old daughter, Praveena. She is the main storyteller.The Story-tellers [Illustrated by Sudheer Nath]Praveena tells stories she has heard and read as a child. She tells them in Hindi. She has acquired a limited vocabulary, having worked in Indian households. Her mother tongue is, of course, rapidfire Burmese.Amma’s father was a Malay who came from Malaysia and married a pretty dark-eyed, slim Bangladeshi woman called Naseema. Together they had six children.Today Amma’s father is no more, but her mother, reed thin and stooped at 82, still survives. Amma is her youngest daughter.She was married when barely 17, to Mohammad Aslam. He worked as a driver with the Australian Embassy but died of kidney failure. Amma was barely 40. To support her family, she began working as a cook. Praveena took to cleaning and looking after the house.These women are part and parcel of the house, a colonial British bungalow with sloping red tiled roof and wooden park floors. All around there are swaying coconut trees and a profusion of orangeflower bushes that line the garden. There are delightful shrubs in maroon, lime green and red and white.That isn’t all. Orchids and serpentine vines of the elephant-eared money plant hang in their own fashion from a large shady tree whose name I have yet to decipher.The wind chimes from Thailand, hanging in the doorway, make their own music whenever the wind blows. I got them while browsing in the local colourful market where women rule the roast.Markets are the domain of women. In fact, I got the wind chime from a lively-eyed woman who sold it with a smile that crinkled her eyes so much till they disappeared.The chime displays wheat coloured birds, the sun, moon, the stars and Chinese good luck fishes all baked to perfection. Their music is wonderfully soothing to the ears.We make a quaint threesome – Amma, Praveena and I. We usually sit on the green mosaic stairs of the verandah. I with my notebook, Amma a rotund figure with a liberal smattering of grey in her hair. She coils it so that it circles her comb in a traditional style.Praveena is a modern girl. She doesn’t like the sticky coconut oil her mother favours for her hair. Instead, her curly waist-length hair is shampooed and left loose, small tendrils flying in thewind as her voice, animated by the tale she is recounting, rises and falls.She stops now and then to struggle for the right word in Hindi to describe something and there’s a staccato burst of Burmese as mother and daughter consult.Amma looks heavenward for inspiration while I look expectantly from one to the other. And then Amma suddenly comes up with a rush of words which are surprisingly enough, colonial Hindi. Words that I’d thought, were gone for ever, like my childhood and the remnants of the British Raj.",

    "title": "The Taziyas of Old Delhi",
    "article": "I was wandering in the crowded streets of Chandni Chowk, the heart of purani Dilli or Old Delhi. Until India gained independence in 1947 and a new Delhi came up, it was the ‘only’ Delhi. For close to 300 years, it had been the seat of Mughal power and culture, especially when it came to cuisine. And that is what drew me to that place!I had taken the day off to savour Chandni Chowk’s famous parathas and the juicy sweet jalebi at the famous 200-year-old sweet shop, Ghantewala.But, once there, food wasn’t the only thing that crossed my mind. I was tempted to check out the stores selling silver, imitation jewellery, stationary and other knick-knacks that abound in the place.Suddenly some big colourful structures caught my attention. A closer look showed that they were made of transparent coloured paper wrapped around four bamboo sticks. What could it be?“Ise taziya kahte hain (This is called taziya),” said a voice behind me. Seeing my puzzled look, the man explained patiently.Taziyas are replicas of the tomb of Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad who was killed in the battle of Karbala, on the tenth day of Muharram month, which is the first month of the Islamic calendar.It is to remember the martyrs killed in the battle of Karbala that believers take out processions of mourning. It is as if they are enacting the battle and the subsequent grief during the procession. And the taziya becomes an important symbol of remembrance.That is why so much care is taken in the making of the taziya, which is seen as an honour. Only a few chosen families are involved in making taziyas and the art has been passed down the generations.The making of the taziyas starts almost a month-and-a-half before Muharram. Taziyas come in different shapes and sizes. Three dimensional bamboo frames are erected and covered with sheets of transparent, butter, glossy or opaque paper.These frames are mounted on top of each other to give height and shape. One common design is a square base with a dome on top. The bamboo and paper is embellished with gilt and mica.On Muharram, Muslims take out a procession bearing a large number of taziyas and alams (pennants of Hussain’s army). The mourners beat their chests with grief over the murder of Imam Hussain and cry “Hussain! Hussain!” in collective sorrow.The taziyas are taken to the imambara, a place symbolic of Karbala, where they are broken and buried.Happy with what I had seen and learnt, I thanked the gentleman and decided to make a move. But then, an aroma drew me to a roadside stall&mldr;",

    "title": "The Woman who Collects Children",
    "article": "An inspiring story from our archives: June 2000Some people like to collect stamps. Others prefer stickers, posters, tattoos or coins. But Pinky Bhutia is different. She collects children. In her mountain village, in Sikkim, she is known as the wonderful young woman who adopts all the children she can.Pinky was 14 when she adopted her first child, a Nepali orphan. Today, she has a dozen adopted children, and two sons from her marriage.The Woman who Collects Children []Plump, pink-cheeked Pinky is about 30 years old and she comes from an ordinary family. If you passed her on the street, you wouldn’t give her a second look. She lives in a brown mud-washed house which has a tin roof in Rhenock village. There is a vegetable patch outside. Red hens with noisy chicks run all over the garden looking for worms.If you ask her why she provides a home to so many kids, she smiles. A shy smile which becomes as warm as an afternoon sun. But her eyes are serious. “I know what it is to be poor and hungry.” As a child, her only dream was to eat a full meal of khole (a gruel of maize), and her favourite pastime was watching people with shoes and imagining what it felt like. By adopting poor and homeless children she is making sure that they never feel that helpless.Some of her adopted children are orphans. Some stay with her, because they come from very poor families. And some of her adopted children stay with their parents but receive full support from Pinky.Pinky feels very proud when she sees her children happy and bright. Her oldest baby, Sarita Rai, is now a bright 20 year old. Then, there is 19-year-old Nimbhe who came to Pinky because her mother was unable to look after her. She started work in a government office in Sikkim’s capital Gangtok, two years ago. Ten-year-old Bhim and 14-year-old Kumar came to Pinky five years ago, after their father’s death. They started living on a patch of land given by Pinky and grew vegetables for sale.The fair and quiet Pemkit Lepcha was in class two when she came to the family. She is now in class eight. San Bahadur Chhetri’s parents couldn’t afford to keep him in school, though he was a bright student. Bhutia said she would take care of him. San Bahadur finished his board exams two years ago. Though he lived with his own parents, he taught all the young children in the Bhutia family. Lamu Bhutia was three when Pinky saw him with his parents who worked as labourers. Pinky brought him home and put him in school. He visited his parents from time to time.Talking about her children, Pinky remembers her own childhood. She grew up in a large family of 25 cousins, aunts and uncles. There were 15 schoolgoing children. They would eat a cob of maize or a phaphar (maize) roti, depending on the season, and go barefoot to school. The next meal was only at 4 pm.Pinky’s father was a road construction worker with a very small salary. At the age of 11, Pinky started working during school breaks. For eight hours, she would sweep the roads in front of the road-roller. Her brothers were studying then. The whole family hoped they would become big government officials and the family would not have to suffer any longer.Pinky was 14 and in class eight when she took home her first “daughter” — a weak Nepali baby girl, Sarita Rai. Pinky’s parents did not mind. Pinky left school and started working full-time because she had a baby to feed. She helped build roads and army barracks. Today, baby Sarita is a bright 20-year-old.At the age of 14, Pinky’s parents got her married. Despite having her own children, she adopted nearly a dozen more. Her husband Lapka does not mind. “I like children. It’s not one more mouth to feed but one more soul saved,” he says.Pinky’s children would agree.(Women’s Feature Service)",

    "title": "The World's Hottest Chili",
    "article": "Do you like your chilies hot? For the spiciest, tongue-burning experience yet, head for Assam –that’s where the hottest chilies are grown.For years, Mexico’s ‘Red Savina Habanero’ was believed to be the hottest chili in the world.But now a chili grown in Tezpur, Assam, in northeastern India, is being touted as the hottestchili ever. And coming from a state, which is better known for its tea than its chilies, thisdiscovery has caused quite a stir.The ‘hotness’ of chilies comes from the compound called capsaicin located in the white tissue,which holds the seeds. When you stir fry chilies this compound is released and can take yourbreath away. Scraping away the tissue and removing the seeds reduces the hot flavour ofchilies.The Tezpur chili is nearly 50 per cent spicier than the Mexican chili as it has the highestScoville units of pure capsaicin. The Scoville scale is named after German scientist, WilburScoville, who was the first to measure the heat component in chilies. The Indian chili wasdiscovered to contain 855,000 Scoville units vis-à-vis the Mexican chili, whichcontains only 557,000 Scoville units of pure capsaicin.The World’s Hottest Chili []Chilies belong to the Solanaceae family, as do potatoes, tomatoes and eggplants. Chilies werefirst cultivated in Peru and Bolivia over 7000 years ago and were widely grown in Central andSouth America. The Spanish explorer, Christopher Columbus, took some chilies back to Spain in1493. He though they were black pepper, and his mistake resulted in chilies beingdubbed ‘chili peppers’.Did you know that chilies are addictive? That is because it increases the production ofendorphins (the body’s natural pain-relieving hormones), which in turn produce a feeling ofwell-being. The burning feeling on your tongue (due to the capsaicin)causes messages to be sent to your brain, to release endorphins. The endorphinsthus released give you some relief.Fresh chilies have twice the amount of Vitamin C found in citrus fruits. When dried,the Vitamin A content increases as much as one hundred fold. Hot chilies (like the Habanerovariety) contain about 357 per cent more Vitamin C than oranges. Chili is mildlyantibacterial and is an excellent gargle for sore throats and laryngitis. InVictorian England, chili peppers were prized for their warming propertiesin treating arthritis, chills, rheumatism, sprains and depression.India is the biggest exporter of chilies – the most popular drug-herb – in theworld today. It is estimated that about 80 per cent of people ensure chiliesare a regular part of their diet.",

    "title": "The curious history of the world's most popular board game",
    "article": "There is a good chance that you have played this board game. And perhaps your parents and their parents before them too.According to the company, that makes it, over 275 million games have been sold in 111 countries. Over the last eight odd years over one billion people have traded make-believe real estate with fake money.If you guessed Monopoly, you would be right. Just in case you have not played this board game, a quick explanation is in order. At the start of the game all the players are allocated some fake cash. From there on every player gets to roll the dice to move around the board. When they land on a property on the board they can buy it if it is not already owned. But if it is already owned by another player they have to pay rent to the owner. The more properties you own the more rent you collect. The aim of the game is to own and control of the entire economy. The game ends when the ‘monopolist’ own everything and all other players are driven into bankruptcy.Over the years this game has come to be seen by many adults as a good game to ‘teach’ children financial literacy. It not only helps children understand how the world of money operates, but also ’teaches’ them skills to negotiate and make tough decisions — essential life skills, in today’s competitive world.What might surprise you though is that before this game was called ‘Monopoly’, it was called ‘The Landlord’s Game’. The game designer Elizabeth Magie had almost the opposite vision of what the game has now come to be. She wanted to use the game to teach the dangers of cutthroat capitalism. During the Great Depression (a time of great financial hardship during the 1920s) this game was used as a tool to teach tenants how landlords were ripping them off.The original creators’ vision was corrupted and a game designed to teach the pitfalls of hyper competitiveness that leaves opponents is economic ruin is now seen as one that teaches financial literacy.But, you might say, it is just a game. Perhaps. While the jury is still out on how games effect children, it is generally agreed that games that have explicit violence require ‘Parental Guidance’. Perhaps Monopoly should be PG13 too.Meanwhile, perhaps when you play this game next, you will think twice before ruthlessly bankrupting your best friend. Or your sibling.First page of patent submission for first version of Lizzie Magie’s board game, granted on January 5, 1904.

    "title": "Viswanathan Anand – The Lightning Kid",
    "article": "Whenever advertisers want a brainy sportstar to talk about their product, very often they think of one name – Viswanathan Anand. A world-class chess champion who was given the name of Lightning Kid because of the speed with which he played.But how are world class champions like Vishy born? For that, ask his mother Sushila. In 1974, when he was five, she first opened a chessboard and taught him the game. She was also his first opponent in the game. Anand was her youngest child.For many of us chess is a very complex game. But it is interesting that most champions often start playing chess in their childhood. Luckily, Anand was living in Madras (now Chennai), which was known as the chess capital of India.Madras had produced India’s first International Master, Manuel Aaron in 1961. Seventeen years later, in 1978, Madras produced India’s second International Master, V. Ravi Kumar. Anand too started playing in local tournaments.In the same year the boy’s life took a new turn. His father, who worked with the Indian Railways, was sent to the Phillippines for a project. Anand and his mother also went with him. Anand left chess-crazy Madras to go to a chess-crazy country – the Philippines! Asia’s first Grandmaster, Eugene Torre, was a Filipino. Florencio Campomanes, who was the President of the world chess organisation, FIDE, at that time was also a Filipino.And the famous world chess championship match between Soviet Grandmaster Anatoly Karpov and Victor Korchnoi, also took place in Philippines’ capital Manila in 1978. Chess was the biggest sport in Philippines. It seemed as if Anand had reached paradise.Viswanathan Anand – The Lightning Kid []There were daily chess programmes on television. Unlike children of his age, he preferred chess programmes to cartoons, and chess magazines to comics! And if ever the postman delivered his magazine during lunch time, Anand would leave the food untouched, and bury his nose inside the book.For Anand the best part of the magazine was the chess puzzle given at the end of each programme. He would solve it and send back the answer. Most often he was right. He won so many prizes that the programme officials finally decided to keep a limit to the answers he could send!His first important world championship was in Paris, in 1983. He finished third despite being unwell. His mother was his most important support; she helped him cope with the pressure of the big match. She often accompanied him on his tours.During those times when she was in Madras, Anand would often call her at the most difficult moment of his match. He would speak to her and get his confidence back.In 1985, Anand became an Asian champion. He was also India’s youngest International Master. Two years later, in 1987, he won the world junior championship, in the Philippines. He was the first Asian to achieve this feat. The same year he became India’s first Grandmaster. He had just turned 18. The Lightning Kid had arrived.Today, Anand is number two in the chess world. Twice he has been close to becoming the world champion. In 1995, he played against Garry Kasparov and lost. In 1997, he lost to Anatoly Karpov in the official world championships. That is the one goal the young champion has set his eyes on.But at 30, he can be very proud of one thing. His success has made chess a popular sport with youngsters in India. That is why India today is proud of having so many junior world champions like Pentyala Harikrishna, Koneru Humpy and Aarthie Ramaswamy, and more than twice that number of Asian champions.<>",

    "title": "We Would All Scream Without Ice Cream",
    "article": "Can you imagine a summer without ice creams?It seems the Chinese, too, couldn’t. For it was they who gave the world its first ice cream. In India, the Mughals are said to have introduced their kind of ice cream — the kulfi. The exact date of origin of the ice cream is not known.Kulfi is a mixture of khoa, pistachio nuts and saffron essence frozen in conical metal containers after sealing it with dough — exactly the same way as it is made today! Khoa is made by boiling milk on slow fire till it becomes semi-solid.This recipe was listed in the Ain-i-Akbari, more than 400 years ago by Abul Fazl, the biographer of Emperor Akbar.According to Fazl, it was Akbar who introduced saltpetre for cooling water in India. Water was poured into small containers, which was placed in larger containers having water and saltpetre. These containers were removed after seven or eight minutes.About 300 years ago, many families had an abdar, or servant who stayed up all night to move an earthen jug of water in a larger vessel carrying water and saltpetre. The contents of the earthen jug would be chilled by morning.The Ain-i-Akbari also contains detailed descriptions about how ice was transported to Delhi from the Himalayas by river and then over land.But, the Harshacharita, which was written much before Akbar’s time, in the 7th century AD or about 1,400 years ago, also mentions ways of keeping things cool by using ice. Historians believe the ice must have been brought from the Himalayas as they continued to do in the Mughal period.In 1775, an English judge described the process of ice-making in Allahabad, now in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Perhaps ice was always made in the area by the same process since long. But no one knows since when.Water was cooled overnight in winter when the temperature was close to freezing point, but never below it. Boiled water was poured into small, shallow, porous vessels, which were placed in shallow pits. These pits were well insulated at the bottom and the sides and were made by scooping out earth in a covered place. The ice, which would form overnight, would then be kept in insulated pits.The British, too, began using this technique on a large scale about 200 years ago in the 19th century and stored it for use all the year round.",

    "title": "Weave of Survival",
    "article": "To unravel the story behind the famed Kota doria sari, Aditi De of the Women’s Feature Service, travelled to Kota in Rajasthan recently. From there she went to the hamlet of Kaithoon, 15 km from Kota. Kaithoon is the real home of the legendary Kota Doria sari. The creation of each sari is a work of art, involving the labour of the entire family of the weaver. The weaving is mainly done by the daughters of the family, most of whom are small girls too busy working to go to school.Pastel shades of peach, azure or lemon yellow, with refined zari borders enriched by golden checks. Or beige backdrops on which are stamped block prints of mangoes, leaves, peacocks and paisleys. Some of you must have seen these and similar designs on the prized Kota saris of your mothers.The Kota sari is a delicate network of natural cotton and silk threads, and is fine as muslin. That is why it’s worn during summer, it is so light to touch.The city of Kota is situated on the eastern bank of the Chambal river in Rajasthan.A half-hour drive past mustard fields, a sharp turn into a maze of cobbled streets, and we are in Kaithoon. A ragtag bunch of children, eyes bright with curiosity, hair matted with grime, follow at our heels as we disembark. The cobbles are spattered with goat droppings. Open sewers line the narrow streets.The world outside recedes as we step into the darkness of a dwelling, where Zahida, a woman of about 30, is busy at a loom. She exchanges a few words with my Rajasthani friend in Hadoti, a language that sounds like Gujarati. Hadoti, the language of theHadas is a legacy of Rao Deva, the Hada chieftain who founded Kotain the 12th century.Zahida’s father, Moinuddin, his hands gnarled with work, his beard grey with experience, uncovers a woven pallav. Against a fine background of midnight blue, we scan floral bouquets in burnt gold reminiscent of Mughal motifs. Spectacular enough to steal the show at a wedding. Pretty enough for a princess.“It takes about a month to weave an elaborate sari. But it takesonly a week for a simpler one,” says Zahida. She adds that each weaver earns about Rs. 300 each for a sari.We learn that these skilled weavers are not able to market their own weaves. It is at this point that merchant middlemen – like Hamid Bihari at Kaithoon who supplies the yarn and sells the saris – step in.All the Muslim families in Kaithoon are weavers. They make up about seven percent of the 20,000 weavers in the city.Weaving is a family profession in Kaithoon. Fathers, mothers, children….everyone is involved. Daughters are trained from the time they are 12 years old. A new daughter-in-law who comes from another village into a family in Kaithoon, is also taught to weave.Saira and Amina are, for instance, two young sisters at the loom. Saira, the younger is honing her skills at the elbow of her sister Amina, two years her senior at 15.As we watch, the shuttle at their tender fingers skims its way through the maze of threads to unravel tiny bird butas at frequent intervals, as if the pastel backdrop was about to take wing.Saira first learnt to weave while barely 11. School doesn’t figure in her daily life, as her family has to live by the loom. Besides spending ten hours at the loom, thesisters also have to clean and cook.Her voice rings in our ears as we later sift through the stunning collection of Kota doria saris at Hamid Bihari’s residence, the only retail outlet in Kaithoon. A classic jacquard in off-white and green costs as much as Rs 14,000.From where did these master weavers originate? About a 100 years ago, Maharaja Umaid Singh of Kota brought down a few families of weavers from Mysore. Their descendants have today been totally integrated into Rajasthani lifestyles. That is why the local population still refers to their weaves as ‘masuriya’ saris.Ours is an age of cheap synthetic cloth, mass produced and sold at the teemingbazaars. The master weavers of Kaithoon, guardians of the Kota doria tradition,are preservers of some part of our fast-disappearing heritage. They, and their families, deserve a better livelihood than the one they have at present.Women’s Feature Service",

    "title": "Welcome to Blind Cow Restaurant",
    "article": "Almost two years ago, a blind pastor, Reverend Jorge Spielmann started a restaurant for the blind in the city of Zurich, in Switzerland. Almost all the chefs, bartenders and waitresses who worked at the Blind Cow, as the restaurant was named, were also blind.Now, not just the blind, but even people who can see with their eyes flock to this restaurant for the unique experience it provides, apart from the good fare it dishes out.The idea came to Spielmann while he was working as a bartender at a public exhibit in 1998, reportsThe Indian Express. The exhibit was an experience for people with normal sight, as they were made to grope through pitch dark tunnels, along with blind people.Spielmann converted an unused church into a 60-seat restaurant. The Blind Cow is decorated with stained glass windows. The reception is dimly lit with a spotlight over the heavy doors. Black curtains make the sitting area pitch dark and there are no lights.Customers who can see, value their experience at the Blind Cow as it enables them to “see” a new dimension to the world, through the eyes of people with no sight but a great deal of vision.There are other reasons why people like going to the restaurant. As no one can see what the others are doing, table manners are temporarily forgotten. Fingers tuck into the meat, the wrong forks are used with relish and people even wipe their mouths on their sleeves, instead of napkins!Welcome to Blind Cow RestaurantWhen customers arrive, they are ushered in by a waitress with bells attached to her toes. Forming a chain led by the waitress, with hands placed on each other’s shoulders, the customers walk inside.Before entering the dining area, they are briefed on the rules of the restaurant – no wandering about, no smoking, no iridescent watches (those producing lustrous rainbow-like colours) and no flashlights.If the customers want anything, they shout to attract the attention of the waitresses. Obviously, it’s a very noisy restaurant.The bells on the waitresses toes help prevent them from bumping into each other while carrying dishes. Though they admit to some unavoidable bumps, the staff at the Blind Cow says that they they have no more breakages than at any other restaurant. Customers to the restaurant are extra careful not to knock things over.The restaurant is so popular that beginning of March 2001, all the tables were booked for the entire month.",

    "title": "What is a democracy?",
    "article": "If three friends need to decide between eating pizza or burgers, they could debate and agree or they could put it to vote and go with the majority. Since there are only two options and three people, once the votes are counted, there would be a winner. This is an example of democracy at work.More specifically, it is an example of what is called a direct democracy. This is a democracy where the voters have a direct say in the decisions made by the group. Imagine if the entire school of 3000 kids had to choose between pizza and burgers. That would be very hard. One way out would be for each class to choose a representative who could then vote on behalf of the entire class. This would be an example of representative democracy.Similarly, entire countries can also make decisions in this way. People could vote directly for every decision or elect representatives who vote on their behalf. The first would be called direct democracy and the second would be a representative democracy.Although no country has a completely direct democracy, Switzerland asks its citizens to vote on a variety of issues. For a large country, this would be impossible to do. For example, India, the world’s largest democracy, and the United States, the world’s oldest democracy are both examples of representative democracy. In representative democracies, the representatives make decisions on behalf of the public who voted for them.Democracy is a way of deciding things that are fair to the members making the decision. It is a concept that is simple when there are only three people involved. Yet it can be used to make decisions for a country with nearly one and a half billion people.Over the years the idea of a democracy has evolved yet the central principle remains the same. Everyone gets a voice in the way their country is run. The process to do this remains the same across small towns and states, to entire countries. Citizens stand for elections and if they win, they have a say in how the country is run.Democracy is a way of managing decision-making so that everyone has a say in the matter. It works on every level, from choosing something to eat to choosing what we do as a country.Unfortunately, until recently, democracy wasn’t for everyone. Till just 100 years ago, women weren’t allowed to vote in the United States, but slowly it expanded to include everyone in most established democracies. Today, out of the 193 countries in the United Nations, 167 of them are democracies (See image below).The Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index map for 2019 [Data Source: Economist Intelligence Unit]",

    "title": "When Grandma challenged British Rule",
    "article": "Whenever I go to my ancestral home in Nainital, I never forget to brush my hand across an engraved name-plate and feel the name on it. The name belongs to my great grandfather who used to work for the British Empire. For his loyalty, he was rewarded with the title of ‘Rai Saheb’.Having worked with the British for years, Rai Saheb gained in wealth and name. And everyone in the household feared him. Well, not exactly. There was one person who dared to defy him: my grandmother. She was his first-born and his favourite.When she was 15, grandmother happened to listen to a public speech by a leader of the Indian National Congress. The fiery speech made a deep impact on her mind. From that moment, she was resolutely drawn to Mahatma Gandhi’s principle ofSatyagraha as the way to freedom from foreign rule.Needless to say, her father never agreed with her. He believed that only the British could run the country. To show his loyalty, he had even placed the British flag atop his house. Grandmother couldn’t stand the flag but didn’t have the courage to act against her father.Mahatma Gandhi leading the dandi marchIn those days, Nainital was in the grip of the freedom movement. There were rallies as well as secret meetings. The scenic hill station on the foothills of the Himalayas was hotting up. There was talk of none other than Mahatma Gandhi coming to Nainital for a conference. And people started making preparations to welcome Gandhiji in their small town.Children made small tri-coloured flags and small posters saying, “Britishers, leave India.” Grandma was no different. She too prepared an Indian flag for her house. But well aware of her father’s anger, she kept it a hush-hush affair. Nobody knew about it, except her sister.Finally, the day of Gandhiji’s arrival dawned. Without caring for the reaction of the British administration, people hoisted flags of the Indian National Congress (INC) on their rooftops to welcome Gandhiji to Nainital. Grandmother too, awaited the perfect moment to commit her deed. As soon as her father left for work, she scampered up the stairs, threw the British flag on the ground and hoisted the flag made by her in its place.As the flag unfurled in the air, she felt a surge of excitement run through her veins. But an Indian flag on top of Rai Saheb’s house was unthinkable. Someone happened to see it and passed the information to Rai Saheb. He stormed into the house, much like an angry bull.The first thing he did was to throw the INC flag aside and replace it with the British flag. And then he proceeded to punish grandmother. It was a severe punishment indeed for a teenager. She was beaten by her father with a local itching plant that causes terrible rashes on the skin and then locked up inside a room. But when Grandma was finally let out of the “chamber of horrors” she had a smile on her face.She had made her point.",

    "title": "When two Voices become One Voice of Peace",
    "article": "Have you ever asked your family members or friends about the images they think of when a mention is made of war? Chances are that many would think of the mushroom cloud made by the atomic bombs that were dropped by the United States over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on August 6 and August 9, 1945, during the Second World War.Bombs wiped out more than half the population of the cities, and made the survivors and future generations suffer the harmful effects of radiation, in the form of terrible diseases and illnesses.“Passing on to the younger generations the memories and the will of those who suffered the bombing is the most important step for humankind to survive in the 21st century. That is the surest way to bridge a rainbow to the 22nd century,” said the mayor of Hiroshima in a news report, on the occasion of Hiroshima Day (August 6).The world is still not rid of the nuclear threat. America, Russia, France, India, Pakistan&mldr; The list seems to be growing. Conflicts are going on in all parts of the world, and violence is still seen as the most effective way to settle scores – for individuals and nations.How can we deal with violence in society? By looking at the causes which drive societies to violent action, and remembering its impact. And the tendency to forget is always very strong. Here is where the intention to keep peace become important.Which is why it is so heartening to read about a project attempted by students from the US and Japan on Hiroshima, at an interesting International Cyberfair Project, in 1998. In a spirit of honesty, both the Japanese as well as American students worked on a poem on Hiroshima, which revealed an interesting process of thoughts.What initially started as negative feelings of hatred towards each other, transformed into emotions of regret, sadness and thoughts about unthinking actions. Like two tributaries flowing into the same sea, the children speak in the same voice of peace that says, ‘no more Hiroshimas and Nagasakis’. The poem was appropriately titled, ‘Poem of Two VoicesChildren of America and Japan speak in the same voice of peaceInitial feelings of the American children_Enola Gay&mldr;overlooking Hiroshima searching for the targetI release the atomic bomb from the aircraftHappy&mldr;the Japanese finally got what they deserved.I feel proud as I look back at the clouds of ash&mldr;the houses burning&mldr;and the destruction_Initial feelings of the Japanese childrenBeautiful morning&mldr;go to work unsuspectingHear airplane&mldr;look upward shielding my eyesUnconsciousness&mldr;shock&mldr;I walk in a dazeAnger towards the Americans&mldr;they, who caused us such pain and despair.I cannot walk without hurting, yet my feelings are numbConclusion of the American children_“I do feel some regret, but I keep in mind we are fighting a war&mldr;revengeRegret&mldr;sadness&mldr;and foolishness&mldr;all thoughts that go through my head when I remember that day.Though I cannot change the past, I know I will never do such a thing again._Conclusion of the Japanese childrenTime has passed now&mldr;slowly I realise that the Americans are not my enemy&mldr;but war itselfI am now full of hope for the rebirth of peace and the prevention of war.\"And then the two voices became one voice when they said:Peace",

    "title": "Where Did Chess Originate?",
    "article": "Chess originated in India around 7th century AD (around 1400 years ago). The game was then called Chaturanga – chatur meaning four and anga meaning parts. The game comprised the four parts of the army: elephants, horses, chariots and foot soldiers besides the king and his mantri (minister).The game was in fact a battle-plan drawn on a smaller scale, to find out ways and means of outsmarting the enemy.How was it played? In the game, one side of the army had to knock out or capture the opponent’s pieces from the board until the king was captured or ‘checked’, that is, made immobile. The player who ‘checked’ the opponent king’s movements won the game.It is still played in the same way.From India, soldiers and merchants took the game to Persia (present day Iran) around 600 A.D. where it came to be called Shatranj. At the same time travellers took the game to China where it was played in a modified form called Xianqui. The Japanese, when they came to know of it, called it Shogi.The Crusaders from Europe who came to fight the Holy Wars in Palestine against the Muslim Saladdin in the 12-13th century took the game to Europe. They called it ‘chess’ from the Old French word ‘echec’ meaning ‘check’.The pieces were made of ivory and consisted of a King, Rook or Castle (the elephants of Chaturanga times); knights (horses and cavalry) and Pawn (foot soldiers). To be in the good books of the powerful Catholic influence of the time, a piece called the ‘Bishop’ was also added. The most important piece, the minister, was replaced by the only female piece, the Queen.Chess became very popular in no time. Landlords during the Renaissance period of the 12th and 13th centuries even played with live people who were beheaded instead of simply being captured!In time players discovered that the first few movements called ‘openings’ could decide the outcome of the game. Experts then kept notes on the games of their opponents, how they played earlier and came up with strategies to preempt these moves.It was only in the 20th century that chess began to be played as a professional game. Seeing how popular these were, newspapers began to publish each game move by move. Then in 1924 the Federation Internationale des Echecs (FIDE) was set up to formulate rules to supervise the game. Players also began to be rated for their performance. They were called International Masters. If they were the best of the best they became known as Grandmaster.FIDE also laid the rule that every player must say ‘echec’ or ‘check’ when the king is in a position of being captured. The king is therefore checkmated ending the game. The word ‘checkmate’ literally means ‘the King is dead’ from the word ‘echec mat’ which in turn came from the Persian word ‘shah mat’.Computers too made the game easier to learn and play. While the average computer can beat an amateur, most experts can beat the computer.Today chess is a popular international sport made famous by India’s own Grandmaster Vishwanathan Anand. Other chess greats include the American Bobby Fisher, Russians Gary Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov, players with huge fan followings. There’s even a separate Olympics for chess, held every two years! Once a pastime of the old, today it is common to see children at six or seven years in international games.The same board is also used to play the game of Draughts or Checkers. Its origin? That’s another story!",

    "article": "Father’s Day, contrary to what many people believe, was not established in order to help greeting card manufacturers sell more cards. It began in the US about a 100 years ago when cards were not as common as they are now.It was started by Sonara Louise Smart Dodd who lived in Spokane, Washington, in 1909.Her father, William Smart, a Civil War veteran, was an outstanding dad. He had raised six children singehandedly after their mother died during childbirth. And Dodd felt that there should be a special day to honour her remarkable father as there was one to honour mothers.In fact, the idea to have a special day for fathers was born one day when Dodd was listening to a Mothers’ Day sermon. She approached her own minister and others in Spokane about having a church service dedicated to fathers on June 5, her father’s birthday. That date was too soon for the minister to prepare the service, so he spoke a few weeks later on June 19.Why is father� day celebratedFrom then on, the state of Washington celebrated the third Sunday in June as Father’s Day. Children made special desserts, or visited their fathers if they lived away.Soon, people’s organisations in other states began lobbying the US Congress to declare an annual Father’s Day. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson approved of this idea, but it was not until 1924 when President Calvin Coolidge made it a national event. Then in 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed a presidential proclamation implementing an official Father’s Day. It declared the third sunday in June as a special day to honour fathers everywhere.Since then, people all over America wear roses (red for for a living father and white if he is not alive) to honour fathers on the third Sunday in June.",

    "article": "Breaking news: Linus Torvalds, (a competitor of Microsoft) has decided to join hands with Microsoft! Alien spacecraft lands at Siberia. Scientists are rushing from across the world to investigate it!What is your reaction on reading these statements? Disbelief? Taken aback? Yes, this is exactly what people may want you to do on this day — take you for a ride! It is April First or Fool’s Day!Most people are fooled when they hear some such unsuspecting news! And that is where the fun begins! Why do people play pranks on this day? It has something to do with the New Year. No, no I am not pulling your leg. Its true! Read on. . .As per the Roman calendar, March 25 was the first day of the spring equinox. This day was therefore, celebrated as new years day. With the spread of Christianity, the day clashed with Easter festivities and new year’s day was shifted to April 1. However, the calendar was not exactly accurate and each year a day had to be adjusted to suit the change in seasons.In 1562, Pope Gregory introduced a new calendar taking into account this extra day. This became the leap year. In the new calendar, new year fell on January first. King Charles IX of France decided to adopt this new calendar and decreed that new year will begin from January 1 and not April 1.The change took some time to be implemented as people were not ready to adjust while others were ignorant of this change! These people continued to celebrate the new year on April first.Some people continued to celebrate the new year on April first.Since new year was a time of exchanging gifts, those who adopted this new change, gave mock gifts to others who were still celebrating new year on April 1 and called them ‘April Fools’. The idea spread and people tried to convince innocent and unsuspecting people that something false or impossible to happen was true!In France, pranksters secretly taped a paper fish on people’s back and cried ‘Poisson d’Avril’ or ‘April Fish’ when the prank was discovered. The custom made its way to England and later Scotland.In Scotland the favourite practical joke was to send someone on a cuckoo hunt. The festival came to be called April Gawk day as the word ‘gowk’ comes from the Scottish word ‘geck’, which means ‘someone who is easily imposed upon’.Many practical jokes are played on unsuspecting people on this day. We should understand though that this should be played in the spirit of fun and not in a spirit of meanness.",
