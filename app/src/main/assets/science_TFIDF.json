    "title": "A Fish with Three Hearts: Cuttlefish",
    "article": "It is said to be a royal among sea animals because it has blue blood, literally. And the cuttlefish has a large heart. Actually, it is not one but three hearts.And it is not even a fish but belongs to the same family as the squid and the octopus. They are called the cephalopods, which literally translated means head-foot.The blood of the cuttlefish is blue because of the huge amount of copper in it. While it uses two of its hearts to pump blood into the gills (the lung of the fish) where it absorbs oxygen, the third heart pumps blood into the other organs.Cuttlefish swimming in oceanWith their flattened bodies, cuttlefish are well suited to life on the sea bed, where they hunt for molluscs and small fish. They have a chalky internal shell called cuttlebone that often gets washed ashore. The cuttlebone has a use: it is fed to canaries and parrots.The cuttlefish is a master at camouflage; it can change its colour to match its background and hide from its predators. This is done by adjusting the size of the pigment sacs in its skin.The pigment sacs are small bags in which the cuttlefish carries several colours. If the attacking animal still manages to detect the cuttlefish, it ejects a black liquid blinding the attacker temporarily while it escapes.",

    "article": "Are you scared of lizards? There is no need to be unless you come face to face with one kind, called the Horned Lizard. It sprays blood from its eyes, and may just make you jump a bit.Not all time. Only when it feels threatened.Surprisingly, the Horned Toad or the Horned Lizard, found in North America and Mexico, is often kept as a pet.Biologists say it squirts blood from its eyes as a form of defence to keep predators away. But, it is a rare occasion when the Horned Toad feels threatened enough to do it.When it feels threatened, the lizard tries to hide itself by wriggling sideways in the sand until its entire body, except the head, is covered. If that does not work, it resorts to the blood weapon.How does the lizard do it? It has the ability to increase the blood pressure in its head, rupture the tiny blood vessels in its eyes and squirt drops of blood upto a distance of several inches. Its blood acts as an irritant in the attacker’s eyes and helps the lizard escape.The horned lizard is popularly called aThe Horned lizards live in desert or semi-desert areas. They feed on insects, particularly ants.There are about 14 kinds of Horned Lizards. They all belong to the Iguanidae family and can be recognised by the horn-like projections on their heads. They have flattened oval bodies with scales on the sides. They vary in length from 7 cm to 13 cm.",

    "title": "A New Camel Specie Discovered",
    "article": "Have you ever sat on a camel? Well, if you have, then you know how scary it is when the camel rises on its long wobbly legs. The rocking motion of a camel is a bit like a ship being tossed around in heaving seas. Small wonder then that the camel is often called the ship of the desert. Actually, the name owes its origins to the fact that camels were brought from the desert, to serve as beasts of burden in other countries.Among the oldest domesticated animals in the world, camels have been used by humans as beasts of burden for more than 10,000 years now. There are very few wild camels left.A Dromedary camel in the Rub al Khali or Empty Quarter. Straddling Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Yemen, this is the largest sand desert in the world.Most of us are only familiar with one species of camel, known as the Dromedary camel. This animal is single-humped, has long legs and is found in the deserts of Asia and Africa. Another specie (the two-humped shorter-legged Bactrian camel) is found in parts of China and Central Asia.A bactrian camel standing high in the mountains of Caucasus, Russia.Recently, scientists discovered what they think is a new species of wild camel that lives in a remote part of China. These mammals look very similar to the Bactrian camel but they have a unique feature – they survive by drinking salty water.Strangely enough, scientists knew about the existence of the animal, but had no idea of their unique identity – their ability to survive on salty water. As a result, researchers now admit that these animals are not Bactrian camels as initially thought, but a new species.The only visible physical difference is that the saltwater drinking specie has its humps further apart than the Bactrian camel. Researchers also discovered that the kneecaps of the ‘new specie’ are quite different from that of their domesticated cousins.Camels are most common in the African and Asian deserts, but fossil evidence shows that camels originated in North America about 45 million years ago. So how did they manage to trapeze into Africa? Well, millions of years ago, North America and Asia were connected by a land mass – the present-day Bering Strait.Scientists think that the camels migrated into South America and across to Asia, disappearing almost entirely from the land of its origin. However, many researchers say that the South American llama is a direct descendent of the camel.As for the new specie of camel, there are fewer than 800 of them left, for people hunt camels for their meat in this barren part of China. It seems to be more of an endangered specie than the giant panda and may well earn the distinction of becoming extinct at the time of its discovery.",

    "title": "A Smelly New World on the Web",
    "article": "Every time you blink, someone is forming an Internet company somewhere in the world. That is the pace at which the Internet fever has caught on with people. They could be young college students with dreams of making a fortune or middle-aged individuals trying to lure the goddess of wealth. Each one is searching for the one great idea that could make his web company click in a big way. And they are trying all sorts of gimmicks to attract people towards their websites.While some websites offer sounds, animation and dazzling graphics on screen to make their sites almost a movie-like experience for the viewer, others provide free downloads and contests.A company based in California, US, has decided to offer online smells to people who visit its website. That is, if a pizza image comes on screen your nostrils will catch the smell of baked bread and gooey cheese! All you need to do is attach a device called ‘iSmell’ to your computer. This smart little device, created by the company, contains some chemicals, which when combined in different proportions, can create a huge variety of smells.The company has invented software that converts the complex chemical composition of different smells into digital signals. An onscreen image, which is programmed with the appropriate digital signal, will activate the ‘iSmell’ device. The device will use the software to reconvert the digital signal and release the correct smell. This gadget reads the digital scent code from the website and creates the corresponding smell from its store of chemicals. This smell is then made to waft in the direction of the user with the aid of a small fan.To ensure that the correct smell is released, the company has created a ‘Scent Registry,’ which contains a digital index of thousands of scents. The company plans to permit website developers to integrate the appropriate smells (in digital code) to their games and images. The company is also hoping that Hollywood filmmakers will incorporate the smell technology in their movies. Imagine audiences getting the smell of rocket fuel as a spacecraft takes off on the cinema screen! Of course, filmmakers will have to be careful not to shoot in dirty neighbourhoods, which has a lot of rubbish lying around.",

    "title": "A Train of Villages on the Net",
    "article": "Most people have fond memories of train journeys, though some have unpleasant ones of being left behind at a station, while they waited for a steaming cup of tea or coffee. Many film directors, too, have been fond of shooting action-packed or emotional scenes at railway stations. The famous action scene at the end of the Hollywood Western ‘High Noon’ showed the cowboy hero, Gary Cooper, silencing the villain. In one Indian film after another, the hero and the heroine have rushed across a crowded station to meet each other never to be separated.Now the Indian Railways has stepped in to make a more effective use of its 7,000 stations all over the country. If the plan succeeds, the stations will connect hundreds of villages to the World Wide Web, according to a report by the British Broadcasting Service (BBC).It’s very simple, really. These stations cover all the major cities, towns and villages. All these stations are connected through cables that maintain telephonic communication between the stations.A team of railway engineers is planning to use the existing cable network to provide Internet connections on rail routes. This way they can avoid the time and money required to lay a fresh cable network to provide Internet connections to villages on the rail routes. This would make the Internet connections very cheap.Telephonic conversations are digitally coded into light and transmitted very, very quickly, over great distances through fibre optic cables. These cables have a much larger capacity than copper cables that is normally used. A single pair of light-transmitting optical fibres can carry over three thousand conversations simultaneously. One single cable contains more than 50 such fibre pairs! The Indian Railways plans to replace the existing copper cables with these high-tech optical fibres. After that is done, opportunities for Internet connectivity will increase tremendously.This Internet project also includes the setting up of cyber cafes in stations for local people who do not own a computer system. The engineers involved in the project are also thinking of developing low cost Internet monitors to make the computer more affordable to them. In India, the stations are located at an average distance of seven km, and each station will be set up to enable wireless Internet connection to more than a hundred households in the vicinity.The project is being tried out in a small area first. The railway engineers are using the cable connection along 40 km of railway track that links the southern towns of Vijaywada and Guntur. The track has five stations and each of the stations will also provide wireless Internet connections for 10 to 15 participating households within a 10 km radius.If the project succeeds, it would be a feather in the cap of the Indian Railways. But, it will still have to deal with the problem of frequent power cuts. The result may well be battery-operated computers, or perhaps computers powered by solar panels!",

Now, this is how the earth’s evolution happened&mldr;We know very little about what happened in the first three hours of the earth’s existence. The first signs of life appeared in the form of bacteria when the earth was four hours old.Then came the first vertebrates (animals with skeletons).

In this 12-hour life span, humans arrived only half a minute before 12! This means that the entire human history is just 10 seconds old – because the chain of evolution from the great apes to humans actually took up 20 seconds!Clocking human follyLet us look at this in yet another way.Compress earth’s existence into 100 years. This means that the dinosaurs came and left the earth about one year ago. Man arrived only two weeks ago. Humans started burning fossil fuels, like coal and petrol, only five minutes ago.However, in these five minutes, human actions have upset more than 99 years of the development of the earth’s environment.And, if we want to save the environment from irreversible destruction, we must act in the next four seconds&mldr;",

    "title": "An Earth Day Fable",
    "article": "Indians are masters of junk. And out of junk they produce masterpieces. One such junk master is the sculptor Nek Chand who fashioned his sculptures from waste. The story goes that Nek chand was once invited to America to fashion sculptures, works of art out of waste. Nek Chand came back disillusioned and glum complaining that their junk was not so good, that its feel and smell was so alien.If Nek Chand turned masterpieces out of junk (see picture below), the slum is a craft built around junk. Every citizen of a slum is a master of recycling. As an Indian scientist once put it “waste is the only resource of a wasted people”. For a slum, one man’s waste is another man’s lifestyle. We were masters of recycling long before it became fashionable.But, sometimes, our art forms become lethally ironic. This becomes clearest in our relation to plastic. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), New Delhi, India’s growth rate of plastic is the highest in the world. Like a virus, plastics have infiltrated every sector of the economy, from agriculture and telecommunications to consumer goods.An Earth Day FableYet, what is intriguing is the way we delay the disposal of plastic waste. Unlike in the west, we happily use it the second and a third time. The recycling industry in India is a Rs. 2000-crore economy. Accompanying it is a network of rag pickers and waste collectors. The figures speak for themselves. If Europe recycles seven per cent of its plastic waste, China 10 and Japan 12 per cent, India recycles 60 per cent of its plastic waste.Parivesh, the CPCB bulletin even talks of a new type of worker — the plastic mechanic who repairs buckets by fusing them. If English newspapers sell at Rs. 4 or Rs. 5 a kg and beer bottles at Rs. 2.50 per kg, plastic waste sells at Rs. 12-15 per kg. The tragedy begins here.Recycling of plastic waste only postpones the problem of disposal; it does not solve them. One has to visit Delhi’s Mundka village to understand this.Mundka is a village, which collects waste from hospitals. Here one sees waste mounds of glucose bottles, urinary bags, surgical gloves and syringes. All these are one-time use items which must be crushed and disposed of. But here everything is collected and recycled. A full cottage industry has grown around the use of such waste. The rag picker who is the hero of recycling becomes the villain of the fable.Worse still, once plastics are reused they are abandoned by the ragpicker. Take plastic bags. Once they are recycled, they have little economic value. They are completely ignored by the kabadiwala and condemned along with a mineral water bottle. The CPCB claims that they are littered in dumps and eventually choke up our sewers and storm water drains. The question we must ask on Earth Day – Is all recycling healthy?Or is one man’s recycling another man’s death warrant? Ecology is full of such ironies.The writer is a well-known anthropologist.",

    "article": "Try opening a bottle of jam. See how skilfully your fingers wrap around the lid and unscrew it?Now researchers at the Brighton University, United Kingdom, are carrying out an interesting study to see if the octopus, too, has the same skill. Makes sense considering it has so many ‘hands’ or tentacles!The scientists have even made a gigantic glass aquarium, specially designed for the resident pet octopus, in the university laboratory. They have named it Roger, after the British actor Roger Moore who acted as James Bond in the Hollywood filmOctopussy.The researchers wanted to test Roger’s intelligence and memory. So they lowered a bottle of jam with a crab in it, into his tank. Roger struggled a bit, but after 20 minutes of twisting and turning the jar, managed to open the lid.In three days, clever Roger had mastered the fine art of opening stubborn lids within a minute. The scientists were delighted!But after a gap of a few days when they tried the same experiment again, Roger had forgotten how to open the jar. Roger had a terrible short-term memory capability. However, the scientists have not given up hope and Roger is still under observation.Wild octopus under waterThe world of the octopusThere are about 200 species of octopus’ in the world. The biggest is the Pacific Giant Octopus, which weighs over 100 kgs and has a tentacle span of more than seven metres. The smallest is the Atlantic Pygmy Octopus. This one is just two centimetres long.This bag-like creature does not have any bones and it can squeeze itself into the tiniest of openings.Did you know that octopuses are related to slowpoke snails? But unlike their slow-moving cousins, octopuses can move very fast indeed. That’s because their tentacles are covered with small suction pads, with which they cling well to clammy rocks and slippery ocean floors.These suction pads are also super-sensitive to touch and taste. An octopus’ sense of taste is 10 to 100 times more sensitive than that of a human!Its eyes, too, are highly developed. Thus it can see clearly in dark or murky water. That equips the clever octopus to hunt at night. This clever creature lures its pray by wriggling the tip of a tentacle so that it looks like a worm.When it is threatened, the octopus secretes an inky substance. This is meant to confuse predators, which gives it time to escape.Most poisons produced by the octopuses are too weak to harm humans. Only the Blue-Ringed Octopus is an exception – it produces enough poison to kill a human being.",

But however big these animals may be, they can not size up to the colonies built by tiny little sea creatures – the coral. The colonies built by corals are called coral reefs. Coral reefs can be as huge as big islands or even as big as a country!These reef-building corals are not single animals. A coral is a colony made up of many individual animals called polyps. These are connected to each other.A cluster of brightly colored Acanthastrea coral also known as Pineapple coral, Artichoke coral, Starry cup coral.A polyp has a hollow, cylindrical structure. It is attached with its lower end to some surface like a rock or the shallow seabed. At the free end is a mouth that is surrounded by tentacles. The tentacles are used to gather food. They are armed with specialised stinging structures, called nematocysts.Polyp: the colony builderStructure of coral polyp. The coral polyps tend to live in colonies and form the building blocks of the reef.When a polyp dies, it leaves behind its skeleton, which is made of a form of calcium carbonate called aragonite. The skeletons are the bricks by which coral reefs are built.Over thousands of years, corals keep depositing their skeletons and newer corals thrive among the skeletons of their predecessors. These in turn form massive colonies, which combine to form a reef.The Great Barrier reef to the north of Australia is probably the most famous of them all. Remarkably, it is the only living organism that can be seen from outer space.Great Barrier Reef, AustraliaThe Great Barrier Reef is one of the planet’s 552 world heritage areas. It is larger than the United Kingdom and longer than the western coast of the United States of America.Because the reef is formed in shallow water, a large amount of sunlight penetrates through it. This is why it is a haven for other sea creatures.The Great Barrier Reef contains at least 1500 species of fish, 350 types of coral and 4000 varieties of molluscs. New species are being discovered every year. Six of the world’s seven species of marine turtle live in the Barrier Reef.However, the reef is in danger today. Partly due to the rise in sea temperature and the subsequent rise in sea levels, and partially because of pollution and fishing activities in the region.",

    "article": "You might have seen the recent English film Anaconda, where these snakes are shown as giant man-eating monsters. Well, that’s not all that can be said about these mighty creatures. Eating is but necessary for survival — and you never know, Anacondas might eat humans too, if one goes near them! But apart from their strange eating habits, these snakes are amazing in a lot of other ways too.The Anaconda (Eunectes murinus) is a semi-aquatic snake found in Central America and mostly in tropical South America. It belongs to the Boa family, Boidae, and is dark green in colour with round black markings. A smaller species is the Yellow Anaconda (E. notaeus), which is yellowish green with irregular dark blotches. Not only does it have a bright looking skin with a distinct colour pattern, but also it is also BIG, I mean, really LOOOO&mldr;…NG! It may reach a length of even 25 feet – which is roughly four times a reasonably tall adult human being! (Pythons, however, are much longer, and have been recorded to be of even 33 feet!)And what’s more, the Giant Anaconda or Water Boa may live upto even 50 years – which is more than what most animals do!With all that, would you believe that the Anaconda is not venomous? In fact, less than one-third of the 2,500 to 3,000 snake species known are poisonous and even fewer than 300 species may be fatal to humans. But sadly, snakes have, almost always, an ominous presence in the minds of people as dark and deadly poisonous creatures, which is created and perpetuated by myths, folklore, books, films, etc. Quite on the contrary, if you actually happen to come by a snake, in all probability it will be more scared of you than you will be of it! And it would not harm you if you don’t harm it either.But, our handsome friend here, the Anaconda, is quite different from other snakes. It kills by constriction, that is, it wraps itself strongly around its prey, squeezing and suffocating the animal to death. And then it swallows its meal whole! And sometimes it might take even several weeks to digest a single prey! Oh, what a lazy and gluttonous animal it is! Anacondas can swallow animals as big as full-grown deer.The Anaconda can glide smoothly and easily in water just like a submarine. Its eyes and nostrils are strategically placed on its small flat head, which peer above the surface of the water like a periscope. This allows the animal to ambush its prey, for example an unsuspecting water bird, without chasing it.The mating habits of Anacondas are rather interesting. Many males may fight among themselves to mate with a single female! Researchers have seen as many as 13 male anacondas writhe and wriggle in such a fight, which looks more like a slow-motion wrestling match that lasts for several weeks! The female and male are different in appearance – for the female is five times bulkier than the male! This difference in size between the sexes is much greater in Anacondas than in any other animal.Most snakes lay eggs which then hatch after a period of time to bring forth the young. The Anaconda’s eggs, on the other hand, hatch just before laying, and the mother Anaconda gives birth to several baby Anacondas. Sometimes, a clutch (the place where the young snakes are born) may have more than 70 newborns! With such a large brood, Mama Anaconda might be feeling rather proud! Researchers are uncertain, though, whether a single male or more father the offspring.But Nature sure has its own way of maintaining the ecological balance, for about half the young Anacondas are eaten by predators like caimans, etc. within the first year itself, and only few remain alive to grow up into big and strong adults. This is necessary, otherwise the Anaconda population would have increased at a very alarming rate. And you can imagine what would have happened if the predating animals didn’t eat the baby Anacondas. There might have been so many Anacondas in the world that they would have been everywhere — out on the streets and in our homes!",

All the students will have to do is download their text- books. Making notes and highlighting important parts of a lesson can be done just as generations of students have done on their textbooks.At present, the project is being tested out in a university.

    "article": "Trees shed leaves in autumn and snakes shed their skin once a year. In the same way, deer shed their antlers every year. Yes, those huge branches on antlers grow fresh every year. At any given point of time, a deer’s antlers will not be more than a year old.It is always the male deer which has antlers, except in the case of the caribou and the reindeer whose females also have antlers.It takes about two to three months for the antlers to grow to their full size. And then they break off when the mating season is over.Antlers: A Deer StoryThe antlers are basically a means to attract the opposite sex during the mating season. Stags use antlers in contests of strength with other deer — a winning male usually secures more female mates.It has been noticed that the deer also uses its antlers to defend itself. It also uses it to mark his territory. It makes marks on trees to let other antlers know that that particular area is his home.Antlers are often mistaken for horns. But, they are very different from a cow’s horns. They are never hollow and they have a honeycomb like structure. While in some deer, the antlers may be single shafts, in some, they could have as many as 11 branches each.The number of branches always varies with age. So, a deer’s age can be calculated with the help of its antlers.Antlers: A deer storyIn the first year, the deer grows two knoblike things on his forehead. These are called pedicles. When the antlers break off, they break from the pedicles and grow at the same spot next year. In the second year, a straight spike grows out of the pedicle, and in the third year, the first branch appears.When the antlers are growing, they are covered with a sensitive skin called the “velvet”. The velvet is filled with blood vessels which helps the bone to grow. When the antlers reach their full size, a ring is formed at the base of the antlers which cuts off the blood supply to the velvet. With no blood supply, the velvet withers, dries up and finally falls off. Whatever is left is rubbed off by the deer on the branches of trees.",

That would be like living 135 storeys below water!There is a very simple explanation about the explosions in their bodies. These fish have a gas-filled swim bladder which helps them float. They adjust the size of this bladder when they want to rest on the water’s surface.The problem arises when these fish are suddenly pulled out of the water by the fisherman’s hook or net. They do not get enough time to expel the extra amount of air in their bladders. As the water pressure decreases, the bladder expands and sometimes explodes. If the bladder doesn’t explode, the fish’s shape gets distorted. Often, the stomach is thrust out of its mouth.Fish that stay even 10 metres below the surface can also get injured if they are suddenly pulled up by a fisherman’s net.",

    "article": "A blow-fly was looking for an ideal place to lay eggs. Like rotting meat. So that when her little maggots were born, they could feed on the meat.As she turned a corner in the grassland, she smelt something stinking in the air. The smell of rotten meat! With great joy she perched on it and laid her eggs. She was happy that her children would have enough food to eat.The blow-fly did not know she had made a great mistake. What she had sat upon was not meat but a flower, which stinks. It is called a carrion flower.So, when the blow-fly’s eggs hatched and the little maggots came out, they had nothing to eat. They died of starvation.The carrion flower is one of the many flowers which give out dirty smells to attract flies. The Rafflesia stinks like rotting meat, while the tropical Lords and Ladies flower gives out a smell like rotting fish.A star shaped succulent Stapelia: Most Stapelia flowers are visibly hairy and generate the odour of rotten fleshThey do it for a special reason. Unlike mating birds, these plants cannot move from their place. But it is important for the male cell of one plant to get in touch with the female cell of another plant. Once that is done, the seed of the plant will bloom and give birth to another plant.A Stapelia in bloom : many of the commonly grown Stapelia flowers smell of rotting meat and are sometimes calledThe plant uses its stink to attract flies. As soon as the blow-fly sits on the flower, it is captured by the flower with strong hair. When the hair falls, the fly is free to fly – but it takes some pollen with it. And goes and sits on another plant. The male cell of one plant meets the female cell of the other. The seed gets new life.",

    "title": "Birds Sing in their Sleep",
    "article": "Just like humans, birds too rely on sound to communicate. However, they do not have a ‘language’ in the true sense of the word and instead emit a variety of squawks and chirps to convey different emotions.Often, birds recognise their mates (or young) by sound rather than sight. Hungry fledglings use begging calls to let their mothers know it is feeding time. Alarm calls, flight calls for flight coordination, and warning calls are other sounds emitted frequently by the adults.In addition to all these regular calls, some male birds develop elaborate songs intended to attract the females. Some feathered pairs keep in touch through duets; the female bird answers the male’s call so promptly, that the duet sounds as if a single bird has sung it!Believe it or not, but birds can pick out the call of a potential mate among thousands of other birdcalls and other natural sounds.A new study carried out by an American University shows that songbirds are perfectionists – they rehearse their melodies even in their sleep. The new finding emerged from a study of the electrical brain activity of a species of Australian songbirds called the zebra finches.Many birds recognize their mothers by sound rather than sight.The research team discovered that the activity in the brain of the birds that were asleep was similar to the brain activity produced when the birds were awake and singing.The team used tiny recording devices to measure the activity of individual brain cells in four zebra finches both when they were singing and when they were asleep.When the recording was played back the nerve cells’ activity (of the sleeping bird) was identical to that which accompanied singing, although the bird produced no sound.Apparently the bird stores a song after hearing it, then rehearses it later in its sleep. Scientists now believe the birds ‘dream of songs and tunes’ to help them master the fine art of singing and that sleep plays a key role in the learning process!It is commonly known that many songbirds learn to sing listening to adult birds of the same species. However, if separated from the adults, the chicks develop unintelligible warbles instead of normal song patterns.If taught the song of an adult of another bird species, the chick grows up singing the new song and passes on the foreign song to its chick.For instance, researchers carried out an experiment in which a male bullfinch was raised by a female canary. The bullfinch soon learned the canary’s song and when it was later mated to a female bullfinch, Mr. Bullfinch taught his children the canary’s songs.Early last year, a British survey of London’s songbirds revealed that the city’s birds are losing their melody. The research team noticed that birds like the cuckoo and the woodchuck had harsher songs with fewer notes and tones.They soon realised that birds could hardly hear one another, over the traffic din; as a result they had difficulty in learning songs and communicating with potential mates.And instead of copying the sweet notes of the adults, chicks were imitating sounds, which they heard most often – namely blaring car horns and beeping cellular phones!",

    "title": "Birds Which Eat Their Feathers",
    "article": "We all know that birds use their feathers to line their nests. But have you ever heard of a bird eating its own feathers?It is a bird which lives in water and is called the great crested grebe. It eats its own feathers and feeds them to her young ones too. And, it always prefers soft feathers, which it sheds throughout the year.Scientists believe that its feather-eating habit is linked to the process with which it throws waste.The grebe has a unique excretory system. It throws out one or two balls of excreta through its mouth on every alternate day. The staple diet of grebes is fish. So, the ball of waste has indigestible fish bones and scales apart from gastric parasites.It is important for the grebe to throw these parasites out. If it didn’t, they would attack the grebe’s intestines and make him sick.According to scientists, the feathers add roughage to its waste. It makes it easier to form the ball of excreta, to throw it out.The grebe’s feathers are silky to touch and are black or gray in colour. Sometimes, it may be reddish on top with white underparts. It is usually 7 to 10 inches long, has short wings and a pointed bill.Another unique feature of the bird are its toes. They are united to form a web near the base, while the remaining portions are rounded flaps. The shape of its toes help it to swim. In fact, the grebes are excellent swimmers and they use their feet only for propulsion under water.When preening, grebes eat their own feathers, and feed them to their young.The grebe makes its nest on floating leaves or plants and lays about two to 10 eggs in it. Although the eggs are white in the beginning, they begin to get stained as the leaves on which the nest is made begins to decay.Both the male and female grebe incubate the eggs and care for the young ones. The young grebes have stripes on them.There are 18 to 20 species of grebes living around the world, some of which are endangered.",

    "title": "Can Plants be Parasites?",
    "article": "All living things are dependent either on other animals or plants for their food. Animals must constantly go in search of food. But plants remain fixed at one place. Some plants make their own food by using energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to make sugar.Green leaves of the plants contain chlorophyll that carry out this process called photosynthesis. But a large number of plants are unable to produce their own food because of the absence of chlorophyll. These plants, therefore, feed on other plants or dead animals.Plants that feed on other plants are called ‘parasites’. Those plants that feed on dead organic matter are called ‘saprophytes’. Saprophytes play an important role in the decay process by digesting and absorbing nutrients from dead material. All fungi and bacteria are saprophytes and they cannot produce food through photosynthesis. Some of the flowering plants are also saprophytes.True fungi are mushrooms, toadstools, truffles, rusts, mildew and bread moulds. Mould is a collective name given to fungi that are not mushrooms. The fur moulds are sometimes seen on bread or vegetables. They grow on these food items and secrete an enzyme to break down the food into tiny parts that they can easily absorb.Some plants are parasites. That is, they do not make food on their own but get water, minerals and food from other plants. Parasitic plants may or may not have chlorophyll. Plants like the mistletoe have green leaves and make some of their own food and take only water and minerals from the host plant through specially developed roots, which secure the parasite to the host and grow into the host’s stem.Dodder (Cuscuta americana) is a parasitic climberTrue parasites such as dodders, which is a kind of morning glory, and cuscuta, are entirely devoid of chlorophyll and rely entirely on the host for food. Others like the mistletoe and rafflesia are partial parasites. Some are parasites of the stem and others attach themselves to the root.The mistletoe can only grow if its seeds are left on branches or tree trunks. When the seeds sprout it sends a single root that ends up as a sucker (or sucking mechanism). It slowly enters the host tree and eventually may surround an entire branch.When a dodder seed germinates, the young plant begins to grow in a circular fashion, searching for a mother plant. Once it gets a host, the thin stem of this plant twines around the host’s stem and starts taking food from the host. Broomrape and figwort are parasites of the root.Rafflesia keithii is a parasitic flowering plant. These flowers are considered to be among the largest in the world and can grow up to one metre in diameter.The most remarkable parasite plant is the rafflesia found in Southeast Asia. One species of this plant, the Rafflesia arnoldii found only in Sumatra, grows the largest flower which is over three feet across and weighs up to seven kg. Its flowers are purplish red and the entire flower can be smelt a mile away as it gives a distinct smell of rotting flesh! Though it grows large flowers, its roots and stems are small as it grows right on the forest floor attaching itself to roots of vines.",

    "title": "Can Two People have Identical Fingerprints?",
    "article": "I was once watching a detective serial on T.V. where the fingerprints of the suspect are required. The hero invites the villain to his home and offers him a glass of water. The bad guy takes the glass and drinks the water from it. After he leaves the hero dramatically whips out a handkerchief and picks up the glass. His expressions showed that satisfaction at a job well done.At that time, I found it amazing – how can smudges on a glass identify people? How can my hand be different from yours – apart from the size that is? It was only after my dad explained me the reason that the mystery behind that highly dramatic scene became clear.Scanning human fingerprint for a Biometric identification systemMy dad explained that if you were to press your thumb on an inkpad and then on a sheet of white paper you will leave a smudge or print, which no one else in the world can make. The same would be true for each of your fingers. The Chinese were the first to use fingerprints to affix their signature on important documents though they had no way of identifying or matching it with the owner.If you look closely at the inside of your palm you can see tiny lines all over. These are absolutely unique and they remain practically unchanged from birth to death.Each print is one-of-a-kind and no two people have the same characteristic. Scientists and criminologists (those who study criminal characteristics) determine the individuality of a fingerprint by a careful study of its ridge characteristics (minutiae) and not by its general shape or pattern.The surface of the skin has been designed to provide our bodies with a firm grasp and to prevent objects grasped from slipping. Skin is composed of layers of cells. The outer portion of skin is called the epidermis while the inner skin is the dermis. Separating the two layers is a boundary of cells called the papillae.Each skin ridge has a single row of pores that open out for the sweat glands. Once the finger touches a surface, sweat from these pores, along with other body oils layer the ridge of the skin and are thus transferred to that surface. The result is an impression of the finger’s ridge pattern. Such prints are referred to as hidden fingerprints because they are invisible to the naked eye.How this fact was discovered and now used by the police force worldwide is very interesting to trace. In 1823, John Evangelist Purkinji, a professor of anatomy at the University of Breslau in Czechoslovakia, published the first document on the nature of fingerprints.In 1856, Sir William Herschel, who was then working for the Indian Civil Service in West Bengal, used thumbprints on documents as a substitute for signatures. In 1880, a British physician Henry Faulds, who was then working in Tokyo, published a paper suggesting that fingerprints left at the scene of a crime could identify the offender. However, Faulds never got the credit he deserved!In 1892, an English scientist, Sir Francis Galton, published a comprehensive book on using fingerprints to solve crimes. At the same time in Argentina, a police researcher Juan Vucetich was also working towards a fingerprint classification system.However, it was in 1896 that Sir Edward Richard Henry, then serving as Inspector General of Police in Jalpaiguri district in West Bengal, India, developed a print classification system that will come to be used globally.Sir Henry and his assistant Khan Bahadur Azizul Haque, discovered that all fingerprints could be systematically classified according to their general ridge patterns. He divided them into three classes on the basis of their general pattern: loops, whorls, and arches.By counting the ridges between any two points in the pattern, each of the ten fingers could be classified into a particular group. Taking the group together as a unit you have a complete system of classifying fingerprints.In June 1897, the world’s first fingerprint bureau was set up in Calcutta and in 1901, Sir Edward Richard Henry was appointed head of Scotland Yard in London, where he implemented the system there. This system, called dactyloscopy or the science of fingerprint identification, is still used by police departments all over the world today with few changes.It works so well that fingerprints can be filed away by these groups, instead of by the name or description of the criminal. Even though millions of prints may be on the file in an office, the right one can be picked out in just a few minutes.Today, technology has improved so much that from even half a print, scientists can identify and match it with the prints in their files and today, fingerprints can be ‘lifted’ from most any surface, not just glass!",

    "article": "Do you think chimps are chumps? If the answer is yes, then you are in for a surprise – because chimps or chimpanzees are actually very, very intelligent. Chimpanzees are the most intelligent of the ape family. It was known that chimpanzees use tools intelligently to obtain food. They use rocks to crack open nuts or use sticks to dig the earth for choice insects and termites.Once a chimpanzee learns a certain method he/she teaches it on to all the other chimps in the area. Scientists say that different groups of chimps follow different customs or styles related to eating, grooming and courtship. So this teaching one group’s ‘customs’ to another group is an act of ‘culturally transmitting a ritual’.Chimpanzees at the Madrid zoo in Spain are a step ahead. They are now puréeing (mashing) up their food themselves. This has amazed both visitors and researchers alike for this is the first instance of an ape transforming food to improve its taste and quality.A contemplative bonobo?It all started with Linda, a chimp who had lost all her teeth. Linda could only eat mashed up fruits and vegetable as she could not chew her food without teeth. One day, Linda was seen eating hard apples. She first rubbed the fruit against a sharp corner of the wall. Then she licked the mashed fruit bits off the wall. Soon other chimps in Linda’s cage began imitating her unique method of mashing up fruit. The clever chimps now were eatting apples, carrots and oranges the same way.Primatologists (scientists who study the behaviour of monkeys and apes) agree that chimps are clever in using tools to open nuts and dig up insects. But they have never been known to pulp the food or mash or grind it before eating. Mashing or pulping food changes the quality adding taste and flavour to the food item.Although chimps are known to have learnt nearly 40 other behaviour methods in this way, researchers are still trying to understand how and where Linda learnt to mash food. Scientists are also not sure if chimps in the wild also mash their food in a similar way.Most scientists say that only captive animals display such human-like methods because the animals are bored and have the time to experiment. Adult animals, in the wild, cannot afford to waste time – they are too busy searching for a meal. On the other hand, young chimps have time to play around and are therefore, more inventive.It is amazing how much chimps and humans have in common. Over 90 percent of our genes are similar. Both humans and chimpanzees belong to a group of tropical animals called primates (which include monkeys and apes). Apes can easily be distinguished from monkeys, for they lack tails. Apes are larger than monkeys and have a more complex brain. Apes are also known as hominids – which means humanlike.Orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees are known as great apes because they are larger and heavier than the lesser apes like the gibbon. The Orangutan is also the only great ape found in Asia in the islands of Sumatra and Borneo.",

    "article": "Cigarette smoking is injurious to health – everyone knows that. Well, till a few decades ago, people were unaware that smoking could cause lung and heart diseases and cigarette packs never had a warning on them, like they do now.In recent years, research has shown that smoking is dangerous and it has now been made compulsory for all cigarette manufacturers to have what is known as, a ‘statutory warning’ printed on the cover. It states that ‘cigarette smoking is injurious to health’.However, cigarette manufacturers do not want people to stop buying their product by reading the warning. So, they have found a convenient way of dealing with the problem. They print the mandatory warning in such small letters that one can barely read them.While European health authorities are now insisting that the size of the letters used in these health warnings should be increased, one British engineering firm, Molins, that supplies machines to make cigarettes, has gone a step ahead. The company wants to patent a talking cigarette packet that recites a health warning every time you open it.A patent is a document issued by the government giving the company the exclusive right to the invention. Making it impossible for any other person or company to manufacture the product.How does it work?The talking packet uses a technology similar to the one used in musical cards. A stiff plastic strip is attached to the lid of the cigarette packet.When the pack is opened, the strip comes into contact with a tiny battery cell (the kind used in watches), which is wired to a small speaker on the base of the pack. This triggers a playback of the health warning.Will cigarette manufacturers opt for these talking packets?Anti-smoking organisations are thrilled with the invention and are insisting that all tobacco manufacturers should use these packs. However, without government intervention, cigarette manufacturers will pay no heed to the request and continue to use tiny-lettered health warnings on their packets.",

    "article": "Sea beaches around HongKong have a problem. They regularly face the threat of a ‘Red Tide’.The ‘Red Tide’ kills fish in sea farms and in the open seas. Actually, the ‘Red Tide’ is reddish brown algae that floats on water near the coastline. It enters the gills of the fish swimming about in the sea and kills them.The gills are like noses of the fish. They help the fish breathe. When the algae enters the gills, it creates havoc.The algae-infected gills fills with mucus and the fish die because they cannot breathe. Their noses do not get any oxygen.Algae can live in water and in moist soils. Like any other plant, they also use the green pigment chlorophyll to make food. But sometimes, the green pigment is covered by another coloured pigment. So algae may have various colours, like blue-green, red, yellow-green and brown. They make their own food and are a source of food for fish.But when fish approach them for food, some of them enter the fish’s gills, leading to disaster.Nearly 1,500 tons of fish have died in sea water fish farms in the recent past. As a result bodies of dead fish often float near the coast of HongKong.Initially, the Hong Kong authorities were not concerned about the algae menace. They thought it was because of sewage pollution.Sometimes, chemicals thrown into the sea brings about the growth of algae. If this happens in lakes and ponds, fish die as algae remove all the oxygen from the water by their rapid growth.Now the evergrowing reddish brown algae has left the authorities worried. Because it is not connected to sewage. And it could prove to be a health hazard too. As algae-infected fish are poisonous and could lead to loss of human lives.",

    "article": "Our solar system is like a busy traffic round-about. The sun is at the centre of this round-about which drives a large number of heavenly bodies, including planets, comets and large and small rocks around it.While the earth and the other planets chart fairly fixed paths around the sun, our smaller solar siblings, like rocks, do not believe in staying in their lanes. As a result, a large rock – the size of a small city – bangs into the earth every once in a while.Deep crater seen from helicopter. Myvatn area in Iceland.One such collision may have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. The effect of the collision can be seen on the plains of Mexico in the shape of a mile long crater. However, humans can do more than being sitting ducks if there is a similar shoot out now.That seems to be the idea of a group of scientists, from the Department of Space Studies, Southwest Research Institute, in Boulder, Colorado, US. They are trying to make the world agree to a standard procedure to deal with such a possibility.They propose that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (an US organisation that manages emergency situations like hurricanes or floods) should also recognise a meteor impact as a potential danger and respond to it the way it responds to floods, hurricanes and earthquakes.They want to make people and the government believe that the threat, though remote, is massive enough to lay down disaster management strategies for.An attempt has been made to identify objects that can strike the earth. These objects, which are a mix of comets and asteroids are called ‘near earth objects’ or NEO. The scientists have been able to identify 1,100 such potentially dangerous NEOs.A potential impact warning has to be calculated and reported years or even decades earlier as that is the amount of time that would be required to handle such a big threat. Scientists propose attaching the comet with a huge rocket to nudge it away or striking the comet with a nuclear warhead in an attempt to smash it to pieces.However, the scientists believe that such an operation would require space observatories, scientists and the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) to work together.One such threat was cited when astronomers announced that an object, known as 2000 SG344, had a 1-in-500 chance of hitting the Earth in 2030.

    "title": "Deception and Mimicry Among Animals to Fool Enemies!",
    "article": "All living beings have enemies. And they all have developed interesting ways to keep them at bay. Some animals hide, others run, or just fly away when faced with danger. These are their defence mechanisms.Some animals can hide without moving. They have the unique ability to change their colour to merge with the surroundings. They become invisible to the predator. This method of defence is called “camouflage”.Some rabbits change colour with the change of season. The snowshoe hare is brown in summer and white in winter. The white fur serves as a camouflage in the snow in winter.Many non-poisonous snakes take on colours similar to poisonous snakes in order to scare off enemies. This form of defence is called mimicry. Some poisonous snakes have very bright colours to warn enemies that it is near. This form of defence is called “warning colouration”.Fishes use another form of camouflage called counter-shading. The underside of most fishes is of a lighter shade than the top. The deeper colour on the top helps it merge with the shadows it makes.There is a kind of fish called the puffer fish which uses an extraordinary device to keep predators away. It swells up like a balloon when it is attacked. Then, its attacker finds it difficult to swallow it.Puffer fish can take in large amounts of water to swell up like a balloon making it very difficult for its attacker to swallow it.Animals which cannot protect themselves in these ways develop other means to do so. Some have claws and teeth which they use to fight, others have poison fangs. Snakes bite, bees sting and skunks squirt an unpleasant smelling liquid to ward off enemies.And then there are animals like the porcupine, whose body is designed to defend itself. It has quills all over its body which could injure an enemy.Like animals, plants too have interesting ways of protecting themselves. But, they have a disadvantage. They cannot move.So, the cactus has developed long spines instead of leaves. These spines act as thorns and prick anyone trying to eat it. Vines have thorns to keep animals away. Some plants have poison, which could be harmful to a predator.",

    "article": "Honey comes in a variety of colours, flavours and fragrances. While some are amber, others are red, brown or yellow. Have you ever wondered why the honey made by the same bees have different colours?Simple. It is made from different kinds of nectar, or the juice that the bees suck out of flowers. Different flowers have different kinds of nectar. And, all of them have different colours.While the nectar collected from the clover plant is usually light in colour, the amber colour comes from poplar, eucalyptus, marigold and magnolia plants. And sometimes, it is really dark in colour.The honey created by the nectar of a kind a wheat called buck wheat is dark in colour. It is found in the United States and in some parts of Europe. It is used by bakers to make a special kind of bread.Different colors of honey",

    "article": "Wondered how plants talk to each other? They do not have the same language as humans but they have their own ways. Recent research by scientists at Kyoto University, Japan, describes how the Lima bean plant protects itself and its neighbours from the spider mite or the red spider. It sends out clear distress signals. Its not like they make weird noises to attract attention, though. It does it very silently.The Lima bean plant emits chemicals to send the message of a troublesome intruder to all its neighbours. That is the signal for all the plants to get their defense mechanisms working.Plants all over the world have qualities, which make then special in their own ways. Some plants produce chemicals that give the leaves and stem a strong taste or smell of chillies, spices and herbs used for cooking. These substances either discourage or even kill insects and other animals that might try to eat the plant.Since plants cannot escape from creatures that feed on them, many have evolved features to protect them against herbivorous or plant eating animals. The two main defenses that plants use are armour and poison.In the Galapagos Islands cacti grow a thick stalk more than two metres tall putting the tender leaves well out of the reach of the giant tortoises.Opuntia cactus at Galapagos island grow a thick stalk more than two metres tall putting the leaves well out of the reach of the giant tortoises.Japnese azaleas produce toxic chemicals that let them survive even among hungry deer. Some of these chemical substances may even prevent the growth of nearby plants. For example, radishes produce a chemical substance, which slows the growth of spinach Similarly, walnut and apple trees cannot grow together because chemicals released from walnut tree kill the apple tree.So it is not just a self-survival instinct that plants have. They also have an instinct for community feeling, as the Lima bean plant shows. Nature is full of unending surprises!",

    "title": "Do Aphasics Make Great Lie Detectors?",
    "article": "Believe it or not but it is true. There are people who lose the ability to understand or use words due to brain damage. But they become extremely good at something else. They become experts at spotting liars. By the changing expressions of people’s faces and the tone of their voice they can make out lies from truth.The condition in which people lose their power to understand or words due to brain damage is called aphasia. A study conducted in Massachusetts, USA, has clearly proved that aphasics make good lie detectors.In the last 100 years, many neurologists, or doctors studying the brain, have mentioned examples of this amazing power of patients suffering from aphasia. Some have even compared an aphasic’s powers to that of a dog with an ability to sniff out people who are faking.Recently, scientists conducted tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied the powers of a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasic. And it was proved clearly that the normal volunteers still got fooled by words. The aphasics were far ahead of them in recognising false speech. The results of the study were reported in the magazine ‘Nature’.Fourteen years ago, famous American neurologist, Dr Oliver Sacks, wrote about his experiences with aphasic patients in a book. The book’s name was equally interesting: ‘The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat’.Dr Sacks remembered a particular incident in a hospital. Patients from the aphasia ward were watching TV. Their president, Ronald Reagan, was giving a speech. Since he had been a film actor earlier, making a flashy speech was no problem for him. He was trying to put feelings into each and every word of his speech.Cogs in the shape of a thinking mind illustrating brain injury and neurological memory loss .But his speech had an opposite effect on the patients. They did not get impressed with him. On the other hand, the entire ward shook with their laughter. The aphasics knew that he did not mean a word of what he was saying. The President was lying!Many doctors have always seen aphasic patients as people who are not totally normal because they lack the ability to understand words. Dr Sacks saw aphasics as more gifted than normal people. Normal people get carried away by words. An aphasic cannot understand words. But he or she can still understand what is being said. For Dr Sacks, that was an indication of their superior sensitivity.He said most of the aphasics had this superior understanding. So, while normal people think of aphasic patients as brain damaged, they actually seem to understand human expressions better.",

In other words, the banana tree is a clump of leaves!A banana plantAt the top of the plant is a chunk of leaves looking like a palm tree. The flower bud grows in the stalk, which is right in the middle of these leaves. From this flower bud grows the bunch of banana fruits, all of which point skywards. There is only one bunch at a time. But, it can be quite heavy. Sometimes, it could weigh up to 45 kilograms!It is believed that the banana originated in Southeast Asia and came to India thousands of years ago. It is, in fact, one of the oldest known fruits to mankind, and is eaten as a fruit as well as vegetable. Some roast it green or boil it, or even make wine out of it. And others just can’t resist the banana split.The word banana is of African origin. Experts believe that it may have a link with the Arabic word banan, meaning a finger or fingers.",

That is because we have been told that washing would clean our food and that cleanliness is necessary to keep diseases away. But, have you seen cows, dogs or cats wash their food? They don’t.But there is one kind of furry mammals called racoons, which wash their food before eating. And it has been noticed that racoons refuse to eat if they cannot find water around. Even if they do, they don’t look too happy about it. Some other kinds of racoons eat without washing their food.Do raccoons wash their hands before they eat?The reason for this unconventional behaviour is not known. What is known is that it is not because they have a sense of cleanliness. Because they don’t seem to mind if the water they are using is dirty. And, they also wash the food they have caught in the water! Probably, they like their food wet.Clean Habits!Actually, most of their food is found in muddy waters. They eat mainly crayfish, clams, fish and frogs that they hunt for in the night. They also eat nuts, berries, fruits and young sheaves of corn whenever they find them. They live in places where there is water and trees for dens. Usually, they set up home in a hollow limb or trunk of a tree.Racoons have young ones once a year, with four or five to a litter. And, within a few months, the young raccoons are big enough to start life on their own.Found in the stretch between southern Canada and Panama, they are grey or brown in colour and may have yellow stripes on them. They have a bushy, ringed tail, which is 25 centimetres long. Racoons vary in size from about 65 to 90 centimetres long. In weight, they range from one to over 11 kilograms.

    "title": "Do Some Animals Farm?",
    "article": "We all live the way we do in villages and cities because a long, long time ago, the early humans gave up hunting for farming. They domesticated plant species by cultivation, ploughed the land and harvested the grain. That was the beginning of civilisation as we understand it.But, do you know that certain ant species were actually farming fungus years before humans learnt how to farm?For many millions of years, ants belonging to the attines group were farming and cultivating fungi in their anthill nests. They had actually domesticated various wild fungi!How did it all begin? The first ant to pick up a fungus perhaps accidentally discovered that the fungi growing on the bits of food were more nutritious than the food itself. The ant then started bringing in decayed leafs to feed the fungus and then to eat the fungus.Under the attini genera or group there are around 200 species of gardening ants. They are found largely in Central and South America.Illustration of ants on fungiThe attines are divided into lower and higher categories. The fungus-growing ants come in the lower category while leaf-cutter ants and several others form the higher category.The lower attines generally have smaller nests with a few hundred workers. They pick up dry and dead vegetation and use it grow their fungus. These include grasses, leaf-litter, the fæces of other insects, and dead insects themselves.The higher attines, on the other had, actually cut leaves from plants and feed their fungus garden. Their nests are larger, with thousands to millions of workers and they live in intricately designed nests.Both categories of the attines continue adding bits of fungus to their garden. The fungus growth in the garden may be as small as a golf ball or as large as pumpkins. Within a few weeks, they have fresh mushrooms (mushrooms, too, come in the category of fungus). These are not the actual mushrooms you see under trees, but are fungal tissues which are eaten by the ants.Just as humans develop new crop strains as the old ones get diseased, ants too gather new crop strains. They do it by going back to the original wild varieties of the crops and experimenting with them. These wild crop relatives help them survive in changing conditions.After an ant domesticates a fungus, that fungus changes genetically and becomes different from the wild variety. Sometimes the fungus dies or changes its genes, and when the ant disperses it, a new variety is formed. From the number and variety of genetic differences, scientists are able to predict how far back ants have been farming. And they have traced it to 15 million years ago!The attines and the fungi form a great relationship that is called symbiosis. Each is beneficial to the other. The ants provide food for the fungus, which they can’t eat themselves. The fungi feed on the plant parts, which get converted into proteins and sugars. These are in a form that the ants can eat. Thus the fungus is the attines’ best friend.Inside the garden, the ants chew leaves to make them softer and speed the growth of the fungus by adding decayed matter that acts like manure. They also weed out any rival fungi that sprout in the garden. Finally, the ants even help disperse the fungi. When a new queen leaves the nest to start her own nest she takes some fungus with her to create a new garden.",

    "article": "Dolphins and whales live in the deep blue sea, but strangely these animals are not able to see the colour blue!Leo Peichl of the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt and his colleagues discovered during routine tests that seals do not respond to the blue colour. Intrigued, they carried out similar tests on few other species, such as dolphins and whales, and found the same results.According to fossil evidence, whales are believed to have descended from a four-legged primitive ungulate (hoofed mammal) which lived on land and was similar to the modern day hippopotamus. Like the hippopotamus the whales come to the surface for breathing to this day. However, tests carried out on hippopotamuses and river otters (close relatives of seals) showed that both species are receptive to the blue color.Do Dolphins see Blue?Peichl and his team believe that millions of years ago, whales and seals lost their colour vision after they split from a common ancestor. But, a handful of Paleontologists (people who study prehistoric animal and plant life through the analysis of fossil remains) are of the opinion that early whales, dolphins and seals lived in coastal waters, where debris including rock, mud and sand tended to blot out the blue light.Over a period of time, their eyes adjusted to the lack of blue and even though, today, whales live in much deeper waters, they still lack the ability to see blue!Most mammals have two types of pigment cells in their eyes, called cones, that pick out blue and green light. Humans and other primates have a third cone for red light. The cone cells help you see finer details of an object, such as colour, while other cells, known as rod cells, respond to light stimuli over a general area, without being able to distinguish details.Dolphins may not be able to see blue, but, unlike humans they can see very well even in murky water, because a dolphin’s eye has 7,000 times as many rod cells as a human eye.",

It spends most of its life on trees in an upside down position.Unbelievable, but true. Sloths eat, sleep, make babies and even give birth to their young ones in this position! But, don’t they fall off when they fall asleep, one might wonder. They don’t.A Sloth hanging upside down on the treeThat’s because the sloth’s muscles do not relax like ours do when we are sleeping. If they did, the sloth would fall off the tree. The muscles become fixed and relax only when the animal awakens.Sloths move about tree tops very slowly. They use their hooked claws of both their toes and fingers to hold on to the trees.What is interesting about the sloth is that its body is made to suit this inverted lifestyle. It can actually turn its head round completely so that it does not see things inverted. And, its hair grows in a direction opposite to that of most other animals we know. It runs from the sloth’s belly round to its back. This ensures that rain water runs off its back.It has a blunt nose and peg-like teeth. It has no tail. It eats leaves, buds and fresh twigs of trees.Does a Sloth live its entire life upside down?If you want to see a sloth, it will be very difficult to spot one. Sloths have green algae on their hair. As a result, they merge with the surroundings and look almost like a part of the tree. This helps them keep predators away.There are two main species of sloths. The Unau sloth and the Ai sloth. While the Unau sloth has two toes on the front feet, the Ai sloth has three.Another creature which spends a large part of its life upside down is the bat.",

    "article": "Largest of the cobweb weavers, the black widow or Latrodectus Mactans is a poisonous spider. They get their ignoble name because the females commonly eat their mates after mating (as is common among spiders) and hence are often widows. They comprise about six species and inhabit warmer regions of the world.Shiny black in colour with a reddish hourglass shape on the underside of her spherical abdomen, the female black widow is about one inch long. The male is about half her size and may have a pair of reddish stripes on the side of his abdomen.They are commonly found on the underside of ledges, rocks, plants and debris, wherever a web can be strung.The webs that the black widows spin lack shape and form. Though the webs are erratic in appearance, the silk is stronger than almost all other arachnids.The diet of the black widow consists of insects, spiders and centipedes. After ensnaring the prey in the web, the black widow makes small punctures in the victim’s body and sucks out the liquid contents.Adult male black widow spiders are rarely seen because the female usually eats them after mating.The adult male black widows are harmless with smaller bodies and longer legs. They are often found wandering in search of females and do not bite or prey on other spiders. They are very rarely seen because the female usually eats them after mating.The female lays several eggs in batches, each containing upto 750 eggs each in one summer. The egg case about half an inch in diameter is suspended in the web. It is pear shaped, white to tan in colour and has a paper-like texture. The young black widows are coloured orange and white when they emerge one to four weeks later. The female black widows may live for more than a year-and-a-half.The black widows prefer to nest near the ground, in the dark undisturbed areas. Nest sites are often near holes produced by small animals or around construction openings and wood piles. The females are shy and nocturnal in habit. They rarely leave their web but will bite if threatened. They are also prone to bite when guarding an egg sac. The bite itself is often not painful and may go unnoticed. But the poison from a widow bite can cause abdominal pain producing cramping and nausea. The black widows inject a toxin that affects the nervous system. Muscle and chest pain or tightness are some of the most common reactions to the widow toxin.Other general symptoms include restlessness, anxiety, breathing and speech difficulty.Only the bite of female, usually the adult female is potentially dangerous. Although extremely painful and temporarily debilitating, fatalities from untreated widow bites are uncommon. Death usually results from respiratory paralysis.",

Scientists have recently discovered that bottle-nosed dolphins can recognise themselves in the mirror – much like you and I can!When you see a zit on your face, what do you do? Go to the mirror time and again, and wonder what it is still doing there. Well, this is exactly what two male bottle-nosed dolphins, Presley and Tab, do as well. So, these lovable aquatic animals are not just seafarers’ friends, but they are also aware of their bodies – almost like humans!A Reuters news agency report in The Telegraph newspaper reports says that Presley and Tab stay in a pool with reflective glass walls in the New York Aquarium.Researchers in the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Osborn Laboratories of Marine Science noticed that when Presley and Tab saw their own reflections, they did not seem to think that they were looking at another dolphin.Dolphins are very social creatures, and are friendly with humans as well as their own kind. This got the researchers thinking. Perhaps the dolphins recognised their own images? So they decided to find out.Using non-toxic ink, they made marks on different parts of the dolphins’ bodies, changing the place every week. Every time their bodies were marked, the dolphins made more trips to the mirror than usual. If the ink mark was on their tummy, they would expose their tummy to the mirror and look at it for a long time.Now doesn’t that sound familiar? Imagine the dolphins wondering – “Now where did that mark come from? I wonder how long it’s going to stay?”Till now, only the great apes like the chimps, the gorillas and the orangutans have displayed this quality of recognising their images in the mirror. All other animals have failed this test.The researchers feel that these findings may increase human sensitivity towards dolphins, which are being hunted and slaughtered in great numbers. Dolphin fins are considered as delicacies in several South-East Asian countries.",

    "title": "Dropping Trees from the Sky – Hydroseeding",
    "article": "Finally there is a simple solution to the growing problems of deforestation and the greenhouse effect – dropping millions of trees out of an aircraft.The idea may sound bizarre but it has come from The Lockheed Martin Aerospace Company, USA. The company has proposed to transform equipments installed in huge C-130 military transport planes for laying carpets of landmines across combat zones, to plant trees in barren areas.A company named Areal Forestation Inc. has already been set up to market the idea. According to a spokesperson at Lockheed,“There are 2,500 C-130 planes in 70 countries, so the delivery system for planting forests is widely available as most planes are lying in military hangers, waiting for someone to hire them.”The promoters believe that with the new planting system, almost 900,000 young trees can be planted in a day. The possiblities are amazing as planes can fly at 1,000 feet, planting more than 3,000 trees cones a minute in a pattern across the landscape. Each cone contains a sapling and that’s around 900,000 trees in a day.The tree cones are pointed and designed to bury themselves in the ground at a uniform depth as if they had been planted by hand. They contain fertilisers and a material that soaks up surrounding moisture, watering the roots of the tree. The containers are made of a kind of metal that biogrades immediately so that the tree can put its roots into the soil.Agricultural aircraft are used for hydroseeding. Here an an agricultural aircraft, sometimes called a spray plane or crop duster, applies chemicals to a field of crops.The argument is – a man on the ground can only plant 1,000 trees a day so if we are to combat global warming, airborne planting is probably the only way. It is believed that the system will work in any area that used to contain trees and even in deserts.We can take comfort in the fact that new forests have been ‘grown’. But there is not much awareness of the harm such manipulated forests can cause to depleted ecosystems.Replacement trees are less able to resist drought, cold, pests and diseases because they grow only in a specific type of land, and not in the complex forest ecosystems that have evolved naturally over the years.The question is – what should be done?Should we plant trees? Yes, of course, plant billions. But can we reforest the Earth in such a way that it will stay reforested forever?Thus we come to the crux of the matter – the trees could save us, if only we would save the trees.These interesting facts come from the ‘Woodpecker volume 2000’, an annual compilation on the state of the planet, published by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehradun, in north India.",

    "title": "Elevator Physics",
    "article": "You get into an elevator (or a lift, as we sometimes call it) and for a second or two, just as the elevator moves down, we feel weightless. On the other hand, if we go up in an elevator, we suddenly feel heavier just as the elevator lurches upwards.To understand this feeling of weightlessness, we need to understand a few basic things first.Mass: The amount of matter that constitues us results in our mass. Mass is the property which “resists” a change in acceleration (linear or angular). It is this “resistance” that results in inertia.Elevator PhysicsWeight (or Actual Weight): When gravity acts on matter (our body), you have a weight (actual weight). But this, theoretically, means that actual weight can only be computed when you consider all the gravities from all the different bodies in the universe acting on the mass. The sum of all these gravities is equivalent to the net gravitational force or the gravitational field (which is not necessarily the same as ‘g’ of the ‘free fall acceleration’). Actual weight only depends on the net gravity and the mass it is acting on.Apparent Weight: As opposed to actual weight, apparent weight is what your weighing machine shows you. When you are standing on a platform, and that platform is neither going up nor down with respect to the earth (whose gravitational field basically dominates every other graviational field), the platform pushes up against your feet in the opposite direction of the earth’s gravity. This “pushing you up” by the platform is what enables you to stand “on” the platform. Your actual weight is — always — gravity acting on your mass. But your apparent weight is the “opposite, pushing-up force’ applied by the platform. Therefore if you are standing on a weighing scale, this opposite force is what the weighing machine can measure.Weightlessness: This is actual weightlessness, and corresponds to actual weight — and this occurs when no gravity acts on your body’s mass, which is an impossible situation in the universe.Apparent Weightlessness: As opposed to actual weightlessness, apparent weightlessness occurs when your apparent weight zeros out. Now, if you remember, apparent weight was the opposite, pushing-up force applied by the platform or the weighing machine on which you were standing.However this opposite force is not always equal to the actual weight. When does such a strange thing happen? Here are two examples. Suppose you are floating in a tub full of water, and try to stand on a weighing machine on the floor of the tub. Though your actual weight remains unchanged, since the buoyancy of the water in the tub exerts an upward force on your body, you can no longer “press” down with as much force as earlier on the weighing machine. This is why the weighing machine will register a lighter apparent weight.In the second example, consider that the platform, on which sits the weighing machine, on which you are standing, begins to fall down at terminal velocity, so that you, the scale and the platform are all falling at the same velocity towards the earth. (For a definition of “terminal velocity”, please go to the end of this article). Now you can no more practically “press” down on the weighing machine, therefore it will register nothing. Your apparent weight has zeroed out and you are in apparent weightlessness. This is what happens to astronauts too in a spaceship orbiting the earth. However you still have actual weight.Conversely had the platform suddenly started climbing upward away from the earth, then you would “press” down harder on the weighing scale for a moment before all the velocities equalized, and the weighing scale would register a higher apparent weight. It’s not as if you really gained a couple of pounds by stepping into the elevator!!So the key concepts to grab are the definitions of weight or actual weight, and the meaning of apparent weight. An experiment on an elevator with a bathroom weighing scale can drive the point home.To conclude (quoting from wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_weight ):An object’s apparent weight is equal to its actual weight, except if:• The object has an acceleration, as in a lift, a rocket or a rollercoaster.• Some force other than the earth’s gravity and the normal force is acting on the object. This may be buoyancy, magnetic force, or the gravitational force of another body.Terminal Velocity: The velocity when a falling object is no longer accerlerating; the force due to gravity is equal to the opposing force of air resistance.. When an object continues to fall steadily until air resistance becomes so great that it equals with the pull of gravity and the object can fall no faster.",

    "article": "There is good news for those who love splashing around in rain puddles and don’t want to get their clothes dirtied. Or those who play soccer but don’t want their shirts to get soiled or wet with sweat. British scientists have created a fabric that never gets dirty or wet!The cloth is treated with a special non-sticky chemical that repels grease and water. This ensures that the clothes remain squeaky clean. But the scientists are not yet ready to make public the formula of this “miracle” chemical, says a report in ‘The Times of India’ newspaper.A well known French company recently launched a new range of jackets that have Teflon in them. Teflon is the plastic coating on non-stick pans that we use in our kitchens. The material has a special characteristic: it does not react to anything. It does not form bonds with other molecules, like grease or water. As a result, dirt and water slip away from the teflon fabric, as easily as a parantha slips out of a Teflon-coated pan.American scientists have gone a step further. They have integrated insecticide in the textile fibre that kills mosquitoes on contact. This new anti-mosquito fabric found immediate buyers. According to reports, several mosquito net manufacturers are trying to outdo each other in the bid to ‘net’ a contract with the company for use of this new technology.",

    "article": "How do you make tea? Simple, put a teaspoon of tea into a boiling cup of water. Strain the water, pour some milk and sugar to taste and the tea is ready! Interestingly, everything that we prepare has a recipe and is made up of simpler ingredients.For example, what is sugar made of? It is made of sugar molecules, which in turn, are made up of atoms. The atom is the building block of all substances.The concept of the atom was first introduced by the Greek philosophers Democritus and Leucippus around 450-420 B.C. The word ‘atom’ comes from a Greek word that means ‘indivisible’. Infact, until recently, the atom was considered to be indivisible.3d model of an atomHow small is an atom?Atoms are very tiny, with diameters like one ten-thousand-millionth of a metre. So, approximately 50,000,000 atoms of solid matter like iron, lined up in a row, would measure one centimetre (0.4 inch).However, Carl Sagan in his book Cosmos says that if you cut an apple-pie into equal halves and further divide each half into smaller and smaller pieces, in about 90 cuts you will reach a single atom. But, there is no knife that can cut so fine. And the apple-pie would become invisible to the human eye in about 20 cuts.How do atoms create other substances?Two or more atoms join together to form a molecule. The molecule is the smallest part of a substance known as a compound. For example, when two atoms of oxygen combine with one atom of carbon, it forms carbon dioxide gas.These compounds group together to form bigger complex substances.What are atoms made of?Is there a recipe for the atom? Yes! As with every other thing, even the atom is composed of smaller particles. These particles are called neutrons, protons and electrons. They are necessary ingredients to make an atom.Scientists have also found substances which make up electrons and protons. So we have a recipe for electrons and protons as well.Everything around us is actually made out of something else, in an unending chain of ingredients and recipes.",

    "title": "Excerpts From 'The Wonderful World of Insects'",
    "article": "What is an Insect?An insect is quite different from you and me. It has a body that is divided into three parts: the head, the middle which is called the thorax and the abdomen which is usually the largest part of the body.Did you know that many insects can see in more than one direction without turning their heads? This is because they have compound eyes. Compound eyes are made up of lots of cone-shaped units packed close together.Excerpts FromAn insect has something else which we don’t. It has two antennae sticking out from the top of its head. Insects use their antennae to tell them about sound, touch, taste and smell.Now we almost have the complete insect; a body divided into three parts, compound eyes and two antennae. But we’ve left out something… the legs. Guess how many legs the insect has? Well, multiply two by three and you have the answer.The insect has six legs. Add two pairs of wings to the insects that fly and you have the complete picture.This is true of most but not all insects.Have you ever wondered how an insect walks? If I had six legs I’d probably get them all tangled up! Well most insects move three legs at a time. This means that they rest three legs on the ground, while they lift the other three. But which three do they move to keep their balance? They move the first and last of one side, plus the middle leg of the other side. Have you got that?Stranger still is the insect walking upside down on the ceiling. Don’t worry, it won’t fall on you. This is because the legs are tipped with claws by which the insect is able to hold onto any surface. What’s more under its claws it has a sticky pad which allows it to cling to any surface and even walk upside down on the ceiling.Last, but not least, did you know that insects taste partly through their mouths and sometimes also through their feet!Ears or No EarsI hope you’re all ears for what comes next, because it may surprise you to hear that only a few insects have ‘ears’. Among the insects that have hearing organs are the grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, cicadas and some moths. The short-horned grasshoppers, often called locusts have their hearing organs located on the side of their abdomens.The long-horned grasshoppers, katydids and crickets have their ears on their front legs.How do other insects hear? Most insects have some hair on their bodies and when these vibrate, they know that something is approaching. They also use their antennae to tell them about sound.Talking about sound, you must have heard the cheerful chirping of the grasshopper or the shrill song of the cricket. Neither of them sing like you and I do because they don’t have voices.They are clever musicians or fiddlers. Grasshoppers make music by drawing their hind legs like a bow against the edge of their wings, and the brown cricket, lying low on the ground, sings its song, by rubbing its two front wings together.If you locate this talented musician, you will find that it is a male. It sings to call the female. Because crickets have ears, the female actually responds to the song.First published by National Book Trust, India",

Well, there is a variety of fish called the lungfish, which are found in Africa. When the rivers overflow, their water spreads to the dry regions around. It forms small lakes or ponds. The fish lives in these ponds.And, when the lakes dry up, the lung fish don’t die. They bury themselves in the wet mud where they can live for months. Specially, if they go deep underground. Sometimes, these fish have been found several metres below the soil.Dipterus is an extinct freshwater lungfish from the Devonian Period of Australia and EuropeLungfish are one of the most ancient bony fishes found on earth today.

    "title": "Footprints on Earth",
    "article": "Have you ever been to a national park? If so, you must have tried to trace or locate a wild animal by trying to see its footprints on the soil. For example, people who go to Jim Corbett National Park, in Uttar Pradesh, India, spend most of their time looking for tigers. They do so by trying to look for its pug marks on the soil. If they find even one, they return happy and spin tall tales of adventure to their friends, about “How I saw a tiger”. We know because we have done it.Footprints on EarthWhile we humans try to locate wild animals through their footprints, Planet Earth quietly keeps a record of our footprints. Human footprints – of every individual, every community, every country. How, you may ask. Simple. The earth provides us almost everything that we need to live, eat, sleep, work, play, travel and entertain. Many of us manage to do all this in great comfort, especially in the cities. Of course, one has to have money to do all this, which more people in the cities have more of than anywhere else. The poor have a bad time even in the cities, be it regarding food, drinking water, sanitation, or shelter.To do all this, one uses up the earth’s resources – its land. Because some of us have more buying power, we end up using more resources than we actually need. We do it because we have unlimited desires and wants. What we need to ask is how much of the earth’s resources are we using up. We also create a great deal of waste and pollution. So we need to think how much land we use to dispose that waste.Two things happen. Vast sections of the world’s population get much less resources than they need to live with dignity. They live surrounded by dirt, disease, drought and famine, as Indians living in Rajasthan and Gujarat are experiencing. Secondly, the earth also undergoes a lot of wear and tear.Paw print of a royal bengal tiger at Sundarbans National Park, West Bengal, India.The amount of resources we use are like footprints. They show whose lifestyles are a burden on the earth and whose aren’t. The lifestyles of individuals as well as countries. For, the earth does not have unlimited resources. Because of the few who eat up most of the earth’s resources, the majority has to bear the consequences – like pollution. This is the ecological footprint that the earth keeps in its memory.Some years ago, a distinguished expert, called William Rees, developed this technique of the ecological footprint. Today, this technique has become like a magnifying glass. It allows us to see whether we are living lives in a way that keeps the earth in a reasonably good shape. Once the earth goes out of shape, there is no hope for living beings.Countries like the United States and Canada are the big gobblers and they have big ecological footprints. Rees calculated that the average amount of energy and materials consumed by a Canadian is the same amount as an area of 4.3 hectares can produce.India has a footprint of 0.4. This means that the energy and materials consumed by an Indian is the same as what 0.4 hectares of land can produce. But if we look carefully, we will find that within India, the footprints of the city Indian are much larger than the rural Indian. And if we look carefully, the urban rich Indian’s footprint may be even larger than the entire size of the poor Indian.",

    "title": "Fox",
    "article": "If there is one animal that lives by its wits then it is our very own Fox. Sheer ingenuity has made him a survivor literally. And it is due to its own dexterity that the Red or common fox is doing very well in Britain, North America and North Africa unlike it’s cousins the wolf and the wild cat. Man is his only enemy. Ironically though, he still prefers to stay close to humans.The fox is the smallest member of the dog family, Canidae. They are agile predators that usually weigh under 7kg. They scavenge carrion, wild fruits and hunt small rodents, rabbits, birds and invertebrates. They hunt small prey sufficient to feed only one animal and hence are solitary predators who do not hunt in packs.The male or dog fox marks out his own area and regards it as his own.Nocturnal by nature, foxes come out of hiding in the night after sleeping through the day in a hole in a sandy bank or some other hiding place under brambles and bracken. With a keen sense of smell, they can figure out the slightest movement.The dog fox and the vixen (female) look exactly alike. Their coat is thick and reddish or yellowish brown with creamy white hindquarters and underparts and a fine tail or brush which often has a white tip. Their ears, legs and feet are almost black. The cubs have shorter muzzles, dark brown wooly coats and little pointed tails. At three months old, they begin to look like their parents and before long wander off to find hunting grounds for themselves.The breeding season usually falls in winter. The vixen with her weird calls (which sounds like the scream of a peacock) announces the arrival of the season. This is a signal to all the dog foxes in the neighbourhood, who quickly make their way to her patch and fiercely fight one another, vying for the vixen’s attention. She may mate with more than one, but the courting season is brief.The vixen ceases to call and the dog foxes depart. The dominant male may stay in the area for a while, without sharing the earth or taking much interest in his mate.In about two months time, three, four or perhaps five cubs will be born, blind at first, snub-nosed and tiny, more like kittens than foxes. Their mother tends and suckles them at least for four weeks, leaving the earth only to find food. Then they begin to come out from the hole, to romp and play near the entrance while the vixen watches. Their mock fights are a good practice to hone their skills that they will soon need in the wild. The vixen brings them mice, beetles and worms to eat and at three months old they try catching things for themselves.Luckily for fox, his sense of smell is so keen that he can catch the scent of a man a long way off. Both sexes leave their own scent everywhere as well, partly by urinating on bushes and posts, partly through scent-glands in the pads of their feet. These scents enable hounds to follow the fox through fields and hedges, often for great distances. Without them they would never find his private paths and lairs, which he knows like a map and which are well hidden.The fox uses his wits, as usual, and as human populations increase and towns grow bigger he has discovered that that he can live quite well in the suburbs, where there are neither hunts nor gamekeepers and food can be snatched from dustbins and rubbish heaps.Many people living near towns or villages would be astonished to learn that the fox could be their friendly neighbour. He is so clever at keeping out of sight, so quiet, so cautious, that they would never believe that he goes through their dustbins in the dark, catches rats by their chicken run and spends the day in a secret lair not a stone’s throw away, curled up like a cat with his thick soft brush tucked snugly over his nose.",

    "title": "Great White Sharks Heading for Extinction",
    "article": "If you want a beach crowded with surfers and swimmers and other sun worshippers to empty out within a minute, cup your hands by the side of your mouth and shout loudly, ‘SHARK’ and wait for this miracle to happen.Because the very word conjures up images from Steven Spielberg’s movie ‘Jaws’. An image of a gaping mouth with rows of razor-sharp teeth and a greyish white shark thrashing around in murky water, grappling with its catch.Great White Shark f ending at Guadalupe Island MexicoSharks are the most misunderstood creatures on earth and myths and rumours have spun a web of terror around this predatory carnivore. For centuries people have labelled sharks as man-eaters, lurking undersea for an unsuspecting swimmer to appear. The presence of a shark’s dorsal fin cause waves of fear and panic resulting in bathers and surfers scuttling for shore.There are about 380 known species of sharks, ranging from 20-centimeter lantern sharks to the massive 12-metre long (but harmless) whale sharks. However, truth is, most sharks are timid creatures. They are curious and may come to inspect you but they are as frightened of you as you are of them.The diet of great white sharks consists of turtles, seals, penguins, dolphins, and other fish. But sadly enough, the six-metre long Great White shark, has gained notoriety as the most dangerous shark alive today!So, are sharks really dangerous? The answer is yes and no. There have been attacks on humans by great white sharks but they are not potential man-eaters. Also, they do not spend their time scouring the sea for humans. If they did that, there would be many more fatalities. The fact is, only about one-third of shark attacks have been fatal while in the remaining cases, victims have survived!Attacks on humans occur only when the shark feels threatened or lacks its usual prey. Most of the times they mistake splashing swimmers (the kicking and thrashing resembles the movements of an injured prey to the shark) causing the sharks to investigate. The panic reaction of frightened swimmers leads to an attack.Sometimes the presence of blood in water also causes shark attacks. The presence of other sharks at the site excites them to a feeding frenzy. This often causes attacks on each other and injured sharks (regardless of their size) get devoured by the others!Sharks have an acute sense of smell and hearing. They can detect a drop of blood dissolved in over one million gallons of water. Sharks do not have external ears, instead, sharks detect sound through the hundreds of pores along the side of the shark’s body that are highly sensitive to wave movements, pressure changes and vibrations in the water up to over two kilometres away.Great White Shark breaching for attack – jumps out of water with open mouthGreat white sharks are found in warm coastal waters and have sighted on every continent except Antarctica. The maximum number of great whites are found off the Australian and South African coasts, sometimes coming in very close to the beach.Adult female sharks reach maturity between 14 and 16 years of age and can reach 7 meters in length. Males generally mature around 10-12 years of age and can grow to over five meters. Female great white sharks are ovoviviparous – which means they hatch eggs inside their bodies and give birth to live young sharks (unlike birds that bear eggs and then hatch them).The embryo takes just over six months to develop and the mother shark takes another six months to give birth. Baby sharks are born in litters of between seven and nine and they are between 120 and 150 cm long.Unfortunately, these sharks are commercially hunted. The situation is so drastic that North American biologists recently published a paper (after years of extensive study) stating that great white sharks should be labelled ‘endangered’ and stricter measures be taken to protect the species.Biologists say that great white sharks are in danger of extinction, primarily due to over-fishing, pollution and destruction of their habitat. Also since the great white shark is slow to reach maturity, the number of fish capable of breeding is very less, leading to lowered population growth.Nobody is quite sure what the real population of great white sharks is, but researchers say that approximately 100 million great sharks are killed each year, many for their fins alone! The dorsal fins are highly relished by the Chinese and shark fin soup is a delicacy in South-East Asia. The fins fetch up to $90 a kilogram in Singapore and Hong Kong.This hunting and killing of sharks, particularly the great white, has forced the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) to tag the species as ‘vulnerable’ or critically endangered. This means that they face the risk of extinction in the near future.So why are sharks hunted? Many humans use certain parts of the great white sharks in rituals, and of course, for food. Almost every inch of the shark is valued. Its liver yields an oil, rich in Vitamin A. The shark’s tough skin is used to make luxurious leather, while the flesh is sold, over the counter, at butcher shops!Sharks play an important ecological role in oceans. Just like the carnivorous animals on land help in keeping the herd healthy, sharks too prey on sick and weak animals under sea to keep the ocean ecosystem healthy.And the commercial hunting of sharks has really endangered the life of the creature, which in the longer run can really harm the ocean food chain.",

    "title": "High-tech Crane Migration",
    "article": "As winter sets in, millions of birds leave their nests in the northern hemisphere and head towards warmer lands in the south. During spring, they once again wing their way back to their original nesting grounds. This yearly ritual is known as migration.While some birds are great travellers, flying from one country to another; others merely flap down from the high mountains to sheltered valleys for the winter. The Arctic tern (of North America) is the hardiest traveller of all. Each year, these birds fly as far south as Antarctica and back, covering a mind-boggling distance of 29,000 kms.Most migratory birds travel along well-defined flight paths that often follow either the coastline or the sea currents. Research shows that birds who migrate by day judge direction by the angle of the sun, while night travellers steer by star patterns. But the actual manner by which the birds convert what they see, into navigational aids, remains a mystery.Migratory birds often suffer drastic losses en route – while some fall prey to predators, others die of exhaustion. American wildlife experts are now attempting a unique experiment, which they hope will establish a safe (and easier) migration route for endangered whooping cranes.A distinctive long-necked bird with a white body, black wing tips and a red crown, the whooping crane stands about 4.5 feet tall and has a 6.5-foot wingspan. It is the tallest North American bird.It is estimated that there are barely 411 whooping cranes left (of which only one migratory flock exists, moving between the Northwest areas of Canada and USA). Experts say another migratory flock is needed to ensure the crane’s survival in the wild.However, instead of risking experimentation with whooping cranes, scientists have chosen a species of cranes, called sandhill cranes, which are plentiful and have similar characteristics to whooping cranes.Sandhill Cranes in flight at sunsetThese sandhill cranes are ordinary birds with a slight modification in their upbringing – they have been hatched and raised with aircraft noise constantly in the background. A pilot is leading a flock of sandhill cranes as they wing their way from the eastern US state of Wisconsin to the south-eastern state of Florida. (Believe it or not, but the pilot is dressed to look like a giant crane and bird puppets are attached to the aircraft).Cranes fly in a V formation to conserve energy. Except for the bird right in front; each bird in the formation gets an added push from the air currents created by the bird ahead. With a plane leading the way, the cranes are still flying in a V-formation with the flock leader flapping close to the plane’s wingtip – close enough get a push from the air currents generated by the plane.If the experiment succeeds, and the sandhill cranes cover the 1,500 km-long migration route, it could help establish a migratory flock of rare whooping cranes in the eastern United States too.",

    "article": "A few months ago, a turtle in Thailand was grievously injured when it was run over by a truck. The animal hardly seemed to have any chance of survival. However, with the immediate help of the Thai Animal Guardians Association, it did survive. The Association admitted the turtle to Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University for medical treatment.The plucky little survivor was named Jikko and the Bangkok Post (a local newspaper) kept readers updated on the animal’s progress. According to veterinarian Nantarika Chansue, Jikko is now quite fit and a fibre-glass shell has been placed over its broken outer shell to speed up the healing process.This means that Jikko is the only turtle in Thailand (and possibly in the world) to have a fibre-glass shell! This artificial shell is made from denture plate material and would crack and fall off when the natural shell is fully restored.More about turtle and tortoise shellsTurtles and tortoises are reptiles, both easily identifiable by their shells. The fossils of these animals date back to the Triassic period (about 245 million years ago). This means that these reptiles existed even before the first dinosaur groups emerged (the oldest one dates back to 200 million years ago). Turtle (and tortoise) shell is made up of a series of bony plates covered with a horny shield. Although the shell is hard, it is a surprisingly sensitive structure because of the many nerves embedded in it.Contrary to popular belief, it is impossible for the animals to crawl out of their shells. This is so because their vertebrae and ribs are attached firmly to the inside of their shells, providing additional support.So what is the difference between turtles and tortoises? Well, turtles have a relatively flattened shell and live in water, whereas tortoises have a dome-shaped shell and live on land.Turtles found in freshwater are called terrapins. They are quite different from marine turtles (like the leatherback and the Olive Ridley) as their legs have webbing and claws. (Marine turtles have limbs that are modified as flippers). The leatherback is the largest living turtle that can attain a weight of about 540 kilograms! The giant tortoise, Geochelone elephantopus (found on the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador) is the largest species of tortoise.",

    "article": "Tibet is known as the roof of the world. That is because it is on a region which has the highest altitude in the world. The Himalayan mountain range merges into the Tibetan plateau to form this region known as the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau.Besides being the roof of the world, this plateau also has a deep impact on the climate of the world, says a report published in the May, 2001, edition of Nature, a science and environment journal. How the scientists made this connection is a very exciting story.Winds and storms carry huge amounts of sand and dust from one region of the earth to another. Over millions of years, layers of such deposits gather on the earth’s surface, each distinguishable from the other.Yaks in the Tibetan plateau – Himalayas Have a Deep Impact on the Climate of the WorldSince the dust and sand carry the unique properties of the region it is carried away from, it can be studied to find out more about the region, such as its climatic conditions.These deposits provide a record of climate that can be read like the pages of a book. “You can dig down into these deposits and read the story of past climate,” says John E. Kutzbach, a climatologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Center for Climatic Research and a co-author of the paper published in Nature.By studying ancient dust deposits in China, the North Pacific and Indian Ocean, scientists from China and the United States have constructed a detailed portrait of the effects that Himalayan mountains and the great Tibetan Plateau have on the climate of Asia.They have established that the rise of the towering Himalayas and the adjacent Tibetan Plateau, were the primary driving force behind the Asian monsoons, which originated about 8 million years ago.They also suggest that this high altitude region may also have helped set the stage for the Ice Ages that began about 2.5 million years ago.Using a computer model, the scientists showed how the formation of the mountain and the plateau enhanced both the winter and summer Asian monsoons and gave rise to a drying trend in central Asia.The mammoth mountain chain has created a wall that has blocked rain from the central Asian plains of Mongolia for the past 8 million years. This has helped create the Gobi and Mongolian deserts. This drying up allowed loose and fine dust to be carried on prevailing winds from the deserts east to China and beyond where it left a record in both land and ocean sediments. These are the sediments that the scientists have used to piece together the sequnce of events during this period of Earth’s geological history.",

    "title": "How Bad is the Sting of a Scorpion?",
    "article": "Ever seen a scorpion scurrying across with two crab-like claws and its tail high in the air? Well this tail is what has to be watched out for! The zing in the scorpion is in its tail for it has a sting.Scorpions are poisonous animals. They are arthropods belonging to the class Arachnida and are relatives of the spiders and ticks. Though they are considered creatures of the desert, you can find them in most climates, hot or cold. They can be found in snow-covered peaks, in caves, in grasslands and forests. You can even find them in your homes.There are approximately 1,300 species of scorpions in the world. Scorpions have a long thin body and a tail that is marked by segments. At the tip of the tail is a tiny hooked sting. Just before the sting is a bulb-shaped structure that contains the venom or poison glands.Scorpions are nocturnal animals. They feed on a variety of insects, spiders, centipedes, and other scorpions. The larger scorpions occasionally feed on animals, such as smaller lizards, snakes, and mice.Scorpions have two pairs of pincer-like claws and four pairs of legs like other arachnids. The claws are called pedipalps. The claws are used to hold the prey while the scorpion lifts its tail and stings the prey.The sting is connected to the poison gland. The poison is used to stun and paralyse the prey and sometimes even kill the prey.How bad is the sting of a Scorpion?The pedipalps are also used for self-defence. The body of the scorpion has a carapace or head shield that bears a pair of main eyes and two or more pairs of lateral eyes. Scorpions detect their prey through vibrations. Fine sensory hair on their pedipalps and on the tips of the legs detect vibrations in the air and on ground.Depending on the species, scorpions give birth to live young ones within four months of mating to sometimes after a year. A female may give birth to between 20 and 30 baby scorpions. Once they are born, the mother assists the babies to climb on to her back.A week after birth the young scorpions get off the mother’s back and live on their own. The average scorpion lives for three to five years, but some may live longer.Despite their murderous reputation, few scorpions are truly dangerous to humans. Only 20 species across the world have venom dangerous to humans. Scorpions use their venom to stun and kill their prey or in self-defense. The venom is a complex mixture of poisons that affect the victim’s nervous system.Normally a scorpion sting produces severe pain and swelling at the site of the sting. The area becomes numb and sometimes leads to frothing from the mouth. Since it affects the nervous system, respiratory paralysis and convulsions follow. The cure for it is anti-venom.Although they are equipped with venom, scorpions themselves are preyed by other creatures, such as insectivorous lizards, owls and mammals like shrews and bats.",

    "title": "How Can We Correct Crooked Teeth?",
    "article": "Smile! A smile actually brightens up your entire face and is the most striking part of your face. But sometimes you are ashamed to smile. Why? Because you have buckteeth? Your teeth are crooked, stained? Have you seen some kids with a mouthful of metal? These are called braces.Today, doctors can work wonders with your teeth. They can straighten your teeth and put a sparkle on it. All this without dentures, mind you!Just as you go to a doctor with an upset stomach or an eye doctor to test your eyes, your teeth also requires attention and care. Teeth help in chewing.Mom and son smiling to show their colorful bracesCrooked teeth will not allow you to chew food properly so partially unchewed food will go down to your stomach. Crooked teeth are also hard to clean and they also hurt the gums. Gaps between the teeth are also dangerous.Sometimes food morsels get stuck between the teeth. If they do not get dislodged with a normal brushing they tend to decay the teeth and form cavities.The best way to correct these problems is when you are a child and your permanent teeth haven’t set. The dentist corrects the teeth by stretching your mouth so that the teeth fit in correctly in its place. This is done by means of braces.Treatment works best between 8 to 14 years of age. By 12 or 13 years of age the milk teeth falls out and permanent teeth come in. It is also at this age that the jaw is growing so it is usually the best time to get treatment.As a child is growing his jaws are still weak and reshaping is easier. Applying pressure to the jaw makes the jaw grow in the direction of the pull. Putting braces thus helps change the shape of your jaw.What are braces? These are metal pieces fitted into the mouth around the teeth to set them in order. They are attached to the teeth by means of bands, which are tightened periodically by the doctor.Braces or orthodontical brackets were first constructed by Pierre Fauchard in 1728. These braces consisted of a flat strip of metal, which was connected to teeth by pieces of thread. In 1841, bands were invented that consisted of a strip of metal with an adjustable screw.In 1915, a doctor called Edward Angle invented the orthodontic brackets. The brackets consisted of little hooks of metal attached to bands that covered the teeth. In 1928, the design was modified to made the edgewise bracket.Sometimes one of your jaws, mostly the upper one, is small and the lower one protrudes out. A special device is then fixed to make the jaws fit together.A closeup of dental bracesThe dentist uses a device called the palatal expander so the teeth and jaw fit together. Buckteeth are corrected by means of a clip-like device called a facebow. Other devices can correct irregular canines, teeth growing over another, etc.Teeth can be corrected at any age. However, as you get older the treatment takes longer and hurts more. The older you are the more painful it gets as the jaws and permanent teeth have set in. Certain people may even need corrective surgery.",

    "title": "How Did Pencils Originate?",
    "article": "Not many people know that the pencil they use everyday can trace its history back 2000 years! Early writers, or scribes as they were called, of ancient Egypt, Rome and Greece wrote on forms of paper called papyrus.They used a stylus which was a metal rod made of lead. That is why we still call the black core of the pencil as “lead” even though it is made from graphite!Graphite was discovered sometime in the 16th century in England. Legend has it that people found bits of shiny, black graphite clinging to the roots of a fallen tree. The whole countryside was abuzz with talk about this mysterious mineral, which soon came to be known as “plumbago” or, more commonly, “Blacklead.”Graphite left a dark mark, making it ideal for use by writers and artists. But it was so soft and brittle that it required a holder. At first, sticks of graphite were wrapped in string. Later, the graphite was inserted into wooden sticks that had been hollowed-out by hand! The wood-cased pencil was born.Graphite, was discovered in the 16th century. People found that graphite could be used to write on paper. But graphite was very soft and would break easily. People would wrap it with twine or string so that they could hold it to write.Strings were not very efficient and sometimes came undone when writing. Someone then thought of taking two pieces of wood and tying it on both sides of the graphite and tying it with strings.Much later it was found that wooden pieces could be drilled through and the graphite inserted within. Thus, the humble pencil was born.Pencils soon came to be produced commercially. In 1662, Germany started manufacturing pencils. These were highly polished pieces of wood and unpainted.As more and more manufacturers started making pencils, they needed some way to distinguish the makers of the pencils. By the end of the 19th century, the wood casings began to carry the manufacturer’s name.Commercially manufactured common yellow pencils.Early American pencils were made from Cedar. Cedar wood, either red cedar or incense cedar was used as the wood was strong and didn’t break easily. Later pencils were made from tropical rainforest trees.However, pencils are no longer made from wood as forests are getting depleted and trees are getting scarce. Most pencils today are woodfree or are made from plastic.The inside of a pencil or the ‘writing core’ is made with a mixture of graphite and clay. By varying the ratio of graphite or clay, manufacturers can increase or decrease the “hardness” of the core.The hardness of the core is often marked on the pencil in numbers and with alphabets. The higher the number the harder the writing core like 2, 3 or HB. The letter “H” indicates a hard pencil and the letter “B” indicates the blackness of the pencil’s mark. So a pencil marked “HB” means it is hard and black; a pencil marked “HH” is very hard but light. The letter “F” indicates that the pencil sharpens to a fine point.Some pencils come with small erasers attached to its back. Earlier erasers were not part of the pencil. In 1858, Hyman Lipman of Philadelphia filed a patent to attach erasers to pencils. These small erasers are called plugs and these are crimped on to the pencil in the factory itself. These erasers are not true rubber at all but made from synthetic rubber or vinyl.Pencils are useful in more ways than one. For one, they can write 40,000 words or draw a line, if you are interested, for 70 kilometres! They can write in zero gravity, or even under water! So if you ever decide to go scuba diving or take a space walk and have an urgent desire to write something, be sure to have a pencil in your pocket.",

    "title": "How Did Santa Claus Originate?",
    "article": "Its nearly midnight and with a jingle of bells a sled comes streaking from the north, pulled of course by Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer. Sitting in the sled is a jolly round red robed figure with flowing white beard and a bag slung over his shoulder that lands on the rooftop with a merry ho-ho-ho.Hey! Its Christmas and its Santa Claus. If you’ve been nice, he slides down the chimney and loads up little stockings hung there with lots of toys and goodies. If you’ve been naughty, then you get fewer toys!Well, this is what everybody believes and all kids look forward to Christmas.Santa Claus was originally Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a bishop who lived in the 4th century in the city of Myra in Asia Minor (now Turkey). At that time Romans ruled Asia Minor and they persecuted all Christians. The Roman emperor Diocletian imprisoned Nicholas.Legend has it that Nicholas appeared in a dream to emperor Constantine the Great to plead for three people who were unjustly condemned to die. The next day the emperor enquired about the case and found that the people had been falsely accused. The emperor immediately set Nicholas free.Detail of an ancient byzantine fresco of the council of Nicaea. From the church of St Nicholas, Demre, Southern TurkeyNicholas was renowned for his pious and gentle nature and his extreme love for children and the poor. In 1087, his remains were taken to the Church of San Nicola at Bari, Italy, and buried there. The Pope made him saint and his Latin name became Sanctus Nicolaus.From the 11th to the 16th centuries, people throughout Europe, particularly in Norway, Greece and Russia, worshipped St. Nicholas. Many churches were also named after him. He became the patron saint of sailors and children as it was said that he helped ships brave the storms and saved many lives.Some ships even had his statue or at least carried his an image to ward off danger. In Norway, December 6 came to be associated as St. Nicholas’ Day. It was said that a bearded saint, whom they called Sinterklaas, would come riding a white horse to give presents to good children and carried a stick to beat naughty children.In the 17th century when the Dutch, along with the English, moved to America to settle there, they landed at New York, which at that time they called New Amsterdam. Since the sailors revered St. Nicholas, they decided to dedicate a day for him.In the next two centuries, the image of the Saint changed with passing generations. In 1823, Clement Clark Moore, son of a bishop, composed a poem “Twas the night before Christmas…\" with the picture of the saint as a jolly old elf riding a sled pulled by flying reindeer. He even named the reindeer by the names we know today. The poem and the image became widely popular.In 1860, Thomas Nast, the caricaturist who created the donkey and elephant images to depict the two political parties in the US, drew a caricature of Santa for Harper’s Illustrated Weekly. Nast added some details to the Santa legend, including a workshop for toys at the North Pole. People soon believed that Santa lived in the North Pole.In 1925, it was discovered that there are no reindeer at the North Pole but they live in Lapland, Finland. In 1927, Markus Rautio who compered the popular ‘Children’s hour’ on Finnish radio revealed the secret of Santa’s address. He declared that Father X’mas lives on Lapland’s Korvatunturi (meaning ‘mount ear’) mountain in Savukoski county, Lapland, Finland.Santa Claus on his sleigh in the nordic countrysideIn 1931, Swedish artist Haddon H. Sundblom was asked by the American soft drink company Coca Cola to do a promotional campaign for them for Christmas.Coca-Cola was a client of Sundblom’s advertising agency from 1924 until his death in 1976. Sundblom painted Santa Claus as a human, a chubby white-bearded fellow dressed in a red coat (Coca Cola’s house colours) trimmed with white fur, red pants, high boots (for walking in the snow) and a leather belt around his middle.This life-like endearing illustration promoted by Coca Cola revolutionised forever the way America and the rest of the world viewed this merry ho-ho-ho-ing figure.From Saint Nicholas to Sinterklaas in Dutch to Santa Claus in America, to Father X’mas in Britain and Père Noël in France, this gift giver is known and looked forward to by children the world over.And to all those who really want to know whether Santa has an address and whether letters written by children reach him, the answer is Yes! There really is a Father X’mas (Santa Claus) address and post is delivered to him. The official post office is in the town of Napapiiri, near Rovaniemi, near the Korvatunturi mountain in Finland. However, the mountain itself is out of bounds to people.",

    "title": "How Did the Indian Postal Service Start?",
    "article": "Although methods of postal delivery varied from one country to another, it is believed that in India, Emperor Chandragupta Maurya who ruled the country between 321-297 BC, was the first to introduce a form of postal communication to dispatch confidential reports to distant posts in his empire.However, the first recorded mention in history is to be found in the writings of historian Ziadduin Barni. He mentions that Ala-ud-din Khilji of the Delhi Sultanate, who ruled Delhi over 700 years ago, organized a regular horse and foot runner service called harakuras in 1296 AD. These runners carried a baton with bells and ran across the allotted territory with mail. Runners changed after each mile and the post was delivered in record time.Mughal Emperor Babar developed the horse courier service and maintained a regular courier postal service.At this time in France, a certain Monsieur de Velayer had the idea of creating a small post office and in 1653, he offered his customers small pieces of paper mentioned ‘receipt for the payment of transport’. Letters with these pieces attached were to be put into letterboxes to be later sent to their destinations.The world’s first pre-paid postage stamps were issued on May 6, 1840 in Britain. Called the Penny Black stamp and the two Penny Blue stamp they carried the portrait of Queen Victoria, who was the British head of state then.Initial public reaction to this idea was not very favourable. But by January 1841, 72 million Penny Blacks were printed and issued.The method was rapidly adopted by other countries and the postage stamp came into being. India, a British colony then, was one of the first countries to adapt this system.Earlier in 1727, the East India Company (a company that had come to trade in India but ended up ruling it instead ) established the first post office in Inidia. In 1786 the first General Post Office was set up at Chennai.Following the Penny black, India issued a half-anna stamp in 1852 (an anna was the earlier Indian currency before the rupee system was adopted. 16 annas equalled a rupee). The world’s first circular stamp, the ‘Scinde Dawk’ (provincial), was issued on July 1, 1852. The stamp was embossed on circular red wafers with the logo of the East India Company. All India stamps for half anna and one anna were issued on October 1, 1854.India was soon leading the world with different variations of stamps. In 1866, for instance, Indian stamps were issued with the word OFFICIAL or SARKARI or SERVICE overstamped on them.Stamp printed by India, shows post office. rook76 / Shutterstock.comSo common are stamps that we take for granted the every tiny detail that goes into the making of this utilitarian product. But to millions of stamp collectors (the hobby is called philately) the issue of a new stamp is an eagerly anticipated event.Among various collector’s items from India are the stamps with multilingual inscriptions or inscriptions in several languages. Between 1871-1948 stamps from the then State of Hyderabad (now Andhra Pradesh) were inscribed in four languages – English, Marathi, Telugu and Urdu.Another collector’s item is the three country stamp. Stamps for Ethiopia portraying King Haile Selassie in his coronation robes, were lithographed (offset printed) at Nasik, in Maharashra state in India, and the value of these stamps were added by letter press printing at Khartoum in Sudan! Thus three countries left their ‘stamp’ on this stamp.Most stamps are printed at government security presses as these stamps have monetary value. However, there have been instances in India when stamps have been printed by other printers.Diamond Soap Works, Kishanganj printed a series of halftone stamps for the princely state of Kishanganj between 1913-16. Between 1911-28, the Jail Press at Jaipur in Rajasthan also printed stamps and for the princely state of Bundi, the ‘Times of India’ a daily newspaper, printed stamps at its press in 1947!And finally for some postal trivia. Mahatma Gandhi is the only person in the world to be honoured with a stamp by over 43 countries of the globe. Over 80 stamps honouring him have been printed including one from the Republic of South Africa.It was in South Africa that Gandhi had once been thrown out of a first class railway carriage for being Indian. To the racist South African regime, Indians were ‘black’ and only white people were allowed to travel in first class!India is also the only country that has a camel post service in the state of Rajasthan, a pigeon post service in Orissa state and a dog post service at Siachen glacier high up in the Himalayas!Today, India has the largest postal network in the world with 1,53,454 post offices, and 5,62,000 letter boxes serving 6,04,341 towns, cities and villages in the country!",

    "title": "How Do Fish Survive in Icy Waters?",
    "article": "In cold winter months, lakes and rivers freeze over forming ice. Yet, fish and other aquatic animals manage to survive.Animals like seals, penguins, walruses and a wide variety of sea birds are all fish eaters. They live in the Arctic and Antarctic Circle, amidst the icecaps. The land is completely frozen. Yet these animals manage to live in this region. How do they do it?The icy waters of the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans support a great amount of marine life. For millions of years life has remained unchanged, making it possible for these animals to adapt themselves to these particular patterns of existence.But they do get some help from nature. All liquids have a boiling point and a freezing point. When water boils at a certain temperature it turns into steam. When it is cooled to a certain temperature it freezes and becomes ice. Water boils at 100 degree Celsius (100 °C) and freezes at 0 °C. When the outside temperature falls below the freezing point of water, lakes and rivers get frozen.However, only the top layer of the lake or river freezes. Underneath the frozen upper layer, the water remains in its liquid form and does not freeze. Also, oxygen is trapped beneath the layer of ice. As a result, fish and other aquatic animals find it possible to live comfortably in the frozen lakes and ponds.Jellyfish: Fragile creature of the seaBut why doesn’t the entire body of water freeze, like a giant, lake-sized ice-cube? Generally, all liquids expand on heating, but water is an exception to this rule. If water is heated, its volume gradually decreases. (This decrease in volume continues till the temperature rises to 4 °C.) At temperatures over 4 °C water starts expanding. It then keeps expanding with the further rise in temperature, till finally at 100 °C it turns into steam.In other words, at 4 °C, water has the least volume (occupies the least amount of space) and maximum density (is at its heaviest). This irregular expansion of water is called anomalous expansion. This anomalous expansion plays an important role by only freezing the upper layer in lakes and rivers.During winter months in colder countries the outside or atmospheric temperature is very low – it drops to below freezing – and the upper layers of water in the lakes and ponds start cooling. When the temperature of the surface layers falls to 4 °C, the water body acquires maximum density and sinks down. The water that sinks down displaces water below, and the lower layers of water simultaneously rise up. This also gets cooled to 4 °C and again sinks down.When the temperature of the water body finally goes below 4 °C, the density or heaviness of water decreases and as a result water does not sink down. The surface water finally freezes at 0 °C while the lower part still remains at 4 °C. The light frozen layer of ice floats on top.Ice does not allow heat to pass through it easily, so the freezing of the waters below is a very slow process. At depths below 30 metres, temperatures are cold and stable, but food is scarce. As a result animals have adapted to this situation by growing more slowly.There are other dangers that fish face in freezing waters – like death. The body fluid of an ordinary fish can solidify if the temperature of the surrounding water drops below -5 °C. So Arctic and Antarctic fish have adjusted to their surroundings in an interesting manner.Certain species of cod, flatfish and polar fish have a reduced metabolic rate and produce antifreeze molecules called glycoprotein to reduce the freezing point of their body fluids. One could look at it as the fishy version of bears hibernating, a survival tactic that has seen these finned friends outlive many other creatures on Earth.",

    "article": "Remember walking to the school or the bus stop on a cold wintry morning? You can see the beautiful crystal drops of dew, and if you happen to be on the grass, they could well be soaking your shoes.Ever wondered why there is no dew in the summer or rainy seasons? Well, special as it looks, dew needs special conditions to form as well. When a warm and clear day is followed by a cool evening and night, which is clear (cloudless), dew is formed.How Does Dew Form?On a clear day, water evaporates from the warm ground into the atmosphere. When night falls, the ground radiates the day’s warmth into the skies. The ground becomes much cooler, causing the water vapour to condense. This condensed vapour is dew.On a cloudy night, the clouds send the heat back to the ground so the ground never gets cold enough for the dew to be formed.When the nights get colder, this dew gets transformed into frost.One may also wonder why dew does not get formed on the soil of the flower beds. The answer is that the plants in the bed keep the ground warm.So, unlike raindrops, dewdrops don’t fall from above. They are formed on the ground itself.",

    "title": "How Does Ice float?",
    "article": "A cool glass of water topped with huge chunks of ice is sure to quench your thirst on a hot summer day. But, before you guzzle the water, look at how the ice floats on the water surface. How do these large ice pieces manage to stay afloat?Ice floats because it is less dense than water. (If you take a one-litre container with ice and weigh it, it will be lighter than a similar container with water.)How Does Ice float?Density : How dense it isAll materials are made up of molecules. These molecules are either bound tightly to each other or are loosely bound. This packaging of molecules is called density. The tighter the molecules, the higher the density of the material.Water flows because the molecules are loosely bound. When you heat water, the molecules go farther apart, converting water into a gas called water vapour.When you freeze water, the water molecules come closer and increase the density. But, this process stops after a point. If you freeze water beyond four degrees Celsius, the water molecules stop contracting and start moving apart. This is called the anomalous expansion of water.You can check this by filling a plastic jar with water and putting it in the freezer overnight. The next day, you will see that the jar has stretched (or even cracked) and the ice has extended beyond the point till which you had filled water.This happens because at four degrees Celsius, water molecules are packed as tight as possible and any attempt to push them closer (by lowering the temperature) only causes strain – the water molecules begin repelling each other and move apart.At freezing point, the molecules form a type of structure that has a lot of air gaps – making the ice much less dense than liquid water.  In other words, the density of water reaches a maximum at four degrees Celsius and lowering of the temperature only decreases the density.Since water freezes well below four degrees Celsius (at zero degrees Celsius), ice is less dense than water and so it floats.",

    "article": "Nine ‘o’ clock. It’s time for your favourite serial on television. Have you ever wondered how the same serial can be viewed by millions of people across the world?This is possible because of satellite television technology. It uses man-made or artificial satellites to send your favourite serial to your television set. But why do we need satellites for this purpose?How Does Satellite TV Work?The earth is roundTo understand this, we have to first take a look at the shape of our earth. Indeed, the earth is a sphere. This means if I were to send signals from one place to another on the earth’s surface, the signals would sooner or later get lost on the curved surface.This is the reason why radio and television towers are very tall. The taller the tower, the farther the signals go. Each tower gathers signals and beams them to the television sets which capture them using their antennas.However, making and maintaining these towers can be very expensive. Also, the area to which a television tower can send signals is small. This is why we need a satellite. It is used to send signals to television sets all over the world.A geo-stationary satelliteA geo-stationary satellite is one which remains fixed over a particular area on the earth’s surface. Actually, it rotates at the same speed as the earth. Hence, it appears to be fixed.These satellites are quite useful things. They can be used to beam a signal to any part of the earth’s surface. When you send a signal to it, it can reflect it back to the earth or transmit it to another satellite. This way, it can reach anywhere on earth.Television broadcasting companies convert television programmes into signals. These are then beamed to satellites, which, in turn, reflect it back to the earth, where they are gathered by dish antennas, installed by the cable operators. The cable operator then transmits these signals through the local cable network to your television.In this entire broadcasting process, satellites behave only as reflectors in the sky that gather and re-transmit television signals.",

He had already set his alarm clock to wake him up at 4 a.m., He wanted his mother to take him to the venue well before the scheduled time.Soon after the initial formalities of flag hoisting and the entry display of the various tableaus came the march past of troops from the armed forces.Royal Navy helicopter hovering close to land. msaunder1972 / Shutterstock.comSuddenly with an ear shattering roar flew the fighter planes, doing aerial acrobatics, amidst thunderous applause from the audience. Then came the moment Rahul was so eagerly waiting for. His father’s name was announced and he could see a helicopter come chattering towards them.The moment it reached above the dais of the President and the Prime Minister, the helicopter stood still in mid-air and showered flowers on the V.I.P guests.“Oh my God!,” thought Rahul, “What is papa doing?. . .He’ll fall down! After all how can something as heavy as a helicopter stand still in mid-air?”However, thankfully a few seconds later, the helicopter flew away without falling down from the sky. But Rahul was very angry with his father. He couldn’t wait to meet his father and ask him why he did that.Later, when his father explained why – Rahul felt very mollified and happy and proud of his father.His father explained that a helicopter is a machine that can fly in any direction: forward, backward, upward or sideward. It can even hover over a single spot. To understand how this is done, we must understand how a helicopter flies.A helicopter has two pairs of propellers – the larger ones at the front, above the cabin and a smaller one at the tail. The larger ones help in flying while the smaller ones stop the helicopter from spinning round when the big blades are turning.As the propeller blades of a helicopter slice through the air, it creates a strong wind. The wind moves downward pushing the helicopter. The air beneath the blades thus, has greater pressure than the air above them. The blades are then twisted slightly so that air is forced downward. This creates a lift.Flaps under the wings of an airplane create a lift in the same way. In fact, the rotor blades of the helicopter are really moving wings. The difference is that the whole airplane has to move forward in order to get lift, whereas the helicopter needs the propeller to fly in the air.This is what enables a helicopter to go straight up or down or hover over one spot. In front of the pilot, is a ‘cyclic stick’. He moves it in the direction he wants to go and the helicopter flies that way. The cyclic stick works by changing the pitch of one blade at a time as it passes the side of the helicopter.This means that one side of the rotor disc has more lift than the other, and the disc tilts. When the disc is flat, the helicopter hovers because all the lift force is straight up, keeping the helicopter in the air. If the disc is tilted, most of the force is still up, keeping the helicopter in the air, but some of the force pushes it and as a result the helicopter moves in the direction it is pushed into.Helicopters can make sharper turns than airplanes and they don’t need a long runaway to take off or land – they can even land on top of a building.In India, the armed forces use helicopters for many different jobs – because of their manoeuvrability, they are ideally used to transport people to places hard to reach easily: people trapped in jungles or mountains; patients to hospitals; or to rescue people in floods and landslides.In certain countries, helicopters are also used to monitor traffic conditions and by the police to catch criminals!That was it! He would also become a pilot, like his father, thought Rahul.",

    "title": "How Does the Steam Engine Work?",
    "article": "In 1804 the first steam-powered engine ran, carrying some iron in Wales, in Britain. But it was almost twenty five years later, in 1829, that George Stephenson, a British engineer, designed the “rocket” that paved the way for railways all over Europe, Asia and America.The steam engine is an example of a heat engine. Heat engines are those that convert heat energy into mechanical work.Heat engines are of two types: external combustion engines and internal combustion engines. In an external combustion engine the fuel is burned outside the cylinder that produces power. In an internal combustion engine the fuel burns inside the cylinder.The steam engine is an example of an external combustion engine while a car has an internal combustion engine. The steam engine consists of:(i) a boiler(ii) safety valve(iii) cylinder(iv) steam reservoir(v) piston and(vi) a drive wheel.A steam engine needs steam to get it going. Coal from a coal tender is fed into the firebox where it is burnt at a temperature of 1400 degree C. This heat is used to turn water, also stored in the tender, into high pressure steam.This high-pressure steam energy is made to pass from the boiler to the steam reservoir through steam pipes. A slide valve in the piston opens and shuts two steam ports, alternately. This ensures that the steam passes through alternate ports.The piston is connected to a drive wheel. When the steam enters into the slide valve, it pushes the piston to the right and turns the wheel. The left valve closes and the right valve is opened letting in steam on the other side of the piston.At this instant, steam entering this valve pushes the piston to its left and drives the wheel to a complete circle. This process goes on repeating and drives the train forward.A traction engine is a self-propelled steam engine used to move heavy loads on roads, plough ground or to provide power at a chosen location.The heavy drive wheel is fixed to the crankshaft of the engine. A speed governor regulates the speed of the engine. In certain engines some of the steam that has passed through the piston and is still hot is used to re-heat some of the cold water before it enters the boiler. The rest of the spent steam billows out of the chimney.Today, most of the functions of steam engines have been taken over by internal combustion engines fueled by diesel which in turn are being replaced by the more ecologically sound electric engines.",

    "title": "How Far Away are the Stars?",
    "article": "The sun is a star, just like the thousands of others we see in the sky each night. But it looks so very big. Is it the biggest star? No. The only reason the sun appears so big is because it is closer to us than any other star.The sun is just 93,000,000 miles (or 14,88,000,000 km) away from the earth. That seems an awful lot of distance, but light can travel so quickly that the sun’s rays reach the earth in a little more than eight minutes! That is the wonder of light.Many of the stars that we see at night, are more than 1000 times farther away than the sun. Obviously, this means that their light, too, would take 1000 times more time to reach the earth. And most stars are so far away that their light takes hundreds or even thousands of years to reach us.The distance travelled by light in a year, is called a light year (for those who have a head for figures, one light year is 58,780,000,000,000,000 miles).Therefore, if light takes 100 years to travel from a star to the earth, we say that the star is 100 light years away (100 x 58,780,000,000,000,000 miles.)Some of the stars we can see in the night sky are so far away that it takes thousands and thousands of years for their light to reach us.Scientists have only been able to see some nearby stars. One of them is Alpha Centauri, which is 4.35 light years away.Yet another star, Alpha Canis Majoris, or Dog Star, which is the brightest star in the sky, is 8.48 light years away.Giant spiral disk of stars, dust and gas is 170,000 light-years across. The spiral galaxy M101 is estimated to contain at least one trillion stars. [Cleaned and retouched image, original by ESA-Hubble]A look into the heavens or a plunge into the pastHere is something interesting to think about. If it takes 8.48 years for us to see the Dog Star, then doesn’t it mean that we are looking at it the way it looked 8.48 years ago? So, in that sense, aren’t we looking back into history?By this logic, if the Dog Star were to die today, when would we come to know about it? Only 8.48 years later, as we humans would continue to see the star till then.The deeper we look into the universe, the farther away we go both in time and space. And that is why scientists believe that if they could see the centre of the universe, then they would actually be able to see the events that led to the creation of the universe.So the next time you watch a movie by the name of Back to the future, you would surely know time travel is as simple as a peep into the night sky!",

    "title": "How Green is Your School?",
    "article": "Here’s a little check – list from the New Delhi based children’s newspaper Gobar Times, to rate your school.Getting ThereOptimum use of the school bus fleet: School bus routes should cover a lot of area, with the fleet picking up as many students as possible.Car pooling: This is quite a workable idea today. Students coming to school from the same neighbourhood should be encouraged to car-pool, after working out the cost of petrol and vehicle wear and tear.The ClassroomSaving energy: Sometimes, we’re so busy making the world a better place that we forget to switch off the fans lights when we leave the classroom.And paper: At the end of a year, there are usually lots of blank pages left in exercise books. These make great rough books and note-pads when torn out and stitched/stapled. Re-using the flip-side of photocopied notes also saves paper. Also photocopy on both sides of the paper.The watering holeThe green canteen: Plastic and thermocol throw-away cups may be cheap and convenient, but they are extremely eco-unfriendly. Investing in some good reusable crockery is cheaper in the long run.School taps: Make sure that drinking water taps and bathroom taps aren’t left running and don’t leak. This will save precious water.Catch water: A school could work out a system of catching rainwater and storing it. Take a space of 25 sq metres, perhaps the roof, in a city that gets 50cm of rain in a year. The amount of run-off would be close to 12,500 litres per year. That’s two months of water supply for a family of four – for everything that a family of four does !The Green PatchOver-watering: Many schools have a field, a lawn or a green patch that is its pride. The mali often leaves the hose spouting water, making soggy patches all over the grass. This does not make the grass any greener. If possible, use sprinklers or a drip-system of watering. These are much more efficient.Home’s best: Plant indigenous or local species of plants and trees which are acclimatised and aren’t water-guzzlers or need artificially-heated hot-houses.Clubbed TogetherAn eco-club that invites interesting speakers to speak at the assembly, organises trips to successful projects or gets involved in green networks is a must.Wall Mag : An eco-mag that’s informative and entertaining, but easy to produce, serves as a platform for sharing new ideas and good experiences. Good work and upcoming events should be displayed on a notice – board. The third alternative is combining these to make a Wall-Magazine.Wasting AwayRecycling garbage: If you have the space, make a compost-pit to turn organic waste produced in the kitchen, etc, into soil-enriching manure that can be used on school lawns. This reduces the use artificial fertilizers.School VastuThe design of a school building should be such that it optimises on natural lighting and air flow. This can reduce the use of lights and fans to a very great extent. So, orienting a building and its doors and windows so that catch the dominant wind and light directions is very important in energy – saving, besides influencing the atmosphere. Doesn’t a dark artificially lighted school make you feel dull?Your school may not have done all of the following, and we certainly haven’t covered everything, either. Its aiming to get there that matters.[ Courtesy: Gobar Times, a children’s newspaper produced by the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment. It aims to create environmental awareness among children by dealing with issues in a language that is simple, quirky and fun, along with innovative visuals.]",

    "title": "How Is Jelly Formed?",
    "article": "Had a good dinner? Now how about some cool custard with jelly on the side for dessert? Doesn’t the jelly look inviting, a transparent red-coloured blob sitting pretty on the plate, making you long to dig your spoon into it?Called Jell-O in the United States of America, jelly changes shape with the change in temperature. It stays sets at room temperature, which is between 0 degrees and 20 degree C. Warm it to about 27 degree C and watch it disintegrate into a watery mixture. Cool it and it thickens until it sets again.Do you know what substance makes jelly set? It is gelatin, a special gel-making agent. Gelatin is made from collagen, which is a fibrous protein found in certain tissues in animals’ bodies. So, your plate of jelly is actually a non-vegetarian dessert!Gelatin is made when animal skin or bone is boiled in water. Strands of collagen separate out of the tissue and react with water to become gelatin. Even one per cent of collagen, when dissolved in water, will make the gel. Gelatin contains millions of long chains of protein that separate into tiny filaments when mixed with warm water.How is jelly formed?Each filament attracts water molecules to itself. This reduces the number of water molecules free to flow through the mixture. As the mixture cools, the water-rich filaments begin to bump into one another and intertwine. The remaining water gets confined within a thicket of protein filaments and the mixture thickens into a gel.Gelatin is used in other foodstuffs like marshmallows and ice creams as well. It is also used to bind chemicals used in photographic film, in pharmaceuticals and glue.Did people use gelatin before it was sold in shops? Yes. People made gelatin at home. And that meant boiling bones, or using isinglass, a kind of gelatin obtained from fish.But today, apart from gelatin, starch and pectin are also used to gel or thicken foodstuffs. Starch is used to thicken sauces and to make confectionaries like Turkish Delight. Pectin, which is obtained from fruit, binds fruit preserves.Starch and pectin are types of sugars formed into long molecular chains. Also called complex carbohydrates or polysaccharides, they are excellent sources of food energy. But gelatin is not. Since it lacks an essential amino acid, gelatin does not have high protein content.",

    "title": "How Lizards Defy Gravity",
    "article": "Lizards slithering up walls or dangling precariously from overhead lights are a common sight in tropical countries. These slimy creatures zipping up walls are called geckos. They are the only lizard species that make any sound, other than hissing — in fact they make a loud clicking noise that sounds like “gecko”, hence the name.Recent studies show that the gecko’s ability to cling on to surfaces could well lead to the creation of the world’s first non-sticky, self-cleaning adhesive! According to scientists at the University of California, gecko feet function a bit like the tape we use for sticking. Of course a gecko’s tenacious hold is far, far stronger than any earthly tape.How Lizards Defy GravityScientist have often analysed the feet of geckos in order to understand the lizard’s sticking prowess. For years scientists assumed that the pads on the lizard’s feet created suction. This idea was discarded when experiments proved that lizards continued to cling on to surfaces — even in a vacuum.Researchers have only recently discovered what really enables geckos to scuttle across ceilings and walls without losing their grip. By carefully examining the tiny hair that cover a gecko’s toes, the team discovered that the microscopic hair split up into even tinier pads called spatulae. These spatulae are incredibly minute (each is about a lakh times smaller than an inch). The combined adhesive property of these pads is quite impressive — in fact the adhesive power is so effective that a gecko can dangle from the ceiling by one toe!By filming geckos, running up walls, the scientists discovered that geckos carefully uncurl their toes as they take each step. And when they take their feet off the wall they simply reverse this process – an act similar to the peeling off of tape from a surface. The tiny hair on the toes rolls out to stick to the surface, as the gecko walks, and then peels off as the gecko lifts its toes. Curiously enough gecko feet do not contain any gummy substances, so the lizards do not use glue or liquid to grab on. Nor do they need a special surface to cling on to – like Velcro requires.The fact that gecko hairs function very, very differently from a regular adhesive (or Velcro) is of great interest to scientists. Researchers are now keen to use gecko hairs to make the world’s first dry adhesives! Scientists also noticed that gecko hairs are self cleaning – apparently, the teeny hair, on the gecko’s toes, always remain ultra-clean and springy. Scientists have yet to figure out why, and when they do – we can get rid of messy glue and opt for a dry, self-cleaning alternative.",

    "title": "How Many Kinds of Rhinos are There?",
    "article": "A modern day rhino or rhinoceros looks pretty much like its ancestor that existed on earth more than 30 million years ago.Its status as an animal “biggie” hasn’t changed much either. The ancestors of the modern-day rhinoceros – the 4 feet tall Uintatherium and the 15 feet high Indricotherium – were the largest land mammals ever. Today’s rhino is the largest living land mammal, after the African elephant, in terms of size and weight.The name ‘rhinoceros’ is derived from two Greek words ‘rhino’ meaning ‘nose’ and ‘keros’ meaning ‘horned’.A pair of African Rhinoceros at the lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya, Africa.There are five different kinds of rhinoceroses in the world. Two of these are found in Africa and three in Asia. The two African varieties are the black and white. The Asian varieties are found in India, Java and Sumatra.The largest rhino is the African white, measuring six feet high at the shoulder and weighing over four tonnes. The smallest is the Sumatran rhino, standing at about four-and-a-half feet at the shoulder and weighing less than a tonne.This powerful animal has one or two curved horns, which grow on top of its nose. The African and the Sumatran varieties have two horns, while the Indian and Javan rhinos have only one horn. White rhinos have larger horns, which can grow up to five feet in length!Rhino horns are entirely replaceable. They are made up of hair-like growth that thickens and grows above the nasal and the frontal bones. The horns are not attached to the skull and may even be torn off during a fight. When this happens, the horn grows back again.A pair of Asian Rhinoceros Bardia National Park, Nepal.Rhinoceroses are herbivores or plant eaters. They are shy and solitary and love to wallow in a muddy pool to beat the heat of the day. As they stomp out of the pool, they have a thick layer of mud, which on drying keeps the rhino cool and also protects the animal against insect bites.While all rhinos have thick hides, the Indian variety, which is found in the northeastern state of Assam, is distinguished with pleated skin that looks like armour plating. At first appearance, when their hides are clean, both the white and black African rhinos look very similar and confusingly have the same colour – grey.However their feeding habits differ. The white rhino is a grazer and eats ground plants and grass. So it has a wide, flat mouth. The term ‘white’ has nothing to do with its colour. It is a corruption of the Afrikaans word (language of South Africa) “wit” meaning “wide” rhino.The black rhino is a browser. It feeds on leaves plucked from shrubs and bushes. So it has a hook-like upper lip.Rhinos belongs to the ‘odd-toed’ group of ungulates (hoofed animals). They have three toes on each foot, each toe ending in a separate hoof. Each front foot actually also has a fourth toe that is no longer used.Rhinos are nearsighted animals, but have good hearing and an excellent sense of smell. When they hear a strange noise or smell something new, they lumber across on their short legs. Their power and sheer weight gives them confidence and, since they can’t see well, they charge without warning.A female rhino bears one calf at a time. The calf is born about 18 months after the mating season and remains with the mother for several years. Though these animals are shy, they are known for unprovoked attacks, especially when there is a young calf around.But the rhino population is dwindling. Over the centuries, man has hunted the animal for its horn, believing that this cone of matted hair contained magical properties.The African black, the Indian one-horned and the Javan species are heavily poached. In fact, the Javan is facing extinction with less than 50 individual rhinos left.The white rhino population has recovered a little over the last 20 years due the rigorous policing of the Kruger National Park in South Africa. To deter further poaching, game wardens sometimes cut off the horns so that these animals are not unnecessarily killed.",

    "title": "How Will our Sun Die?",
    "article": "Everything that is born must die. Not only living beings, but inanimate objects like stars too.The birth of a starThe universe has massive clouds of hydrogen floating around. Sometimes, these clouds come together and form very dense and huge balls of hydrogen gas. As the clouds come close, their temperature increases. This is called a proto-star (original star).The increase in temperature triggers off nuclear reactions at the core of the star. Nuclear reactions inside the star occur when the nucleus of two hydrogen atoms fuse to produce a helium atom. This reaction which is actually the same as that inside a hydrogen bomb, release huge amounts of heat and light. This is what makes a star glow.Our sun is also a star and the heat and light we see is actually the burning of the hydrogen fuel in its heart.Like all things that are born, a star also dies. It dies when it runs out of fuel. It is a little like a car without petrol. But, the petrol tank in a car can be refilled. The star usually does not get a refill.And the death of a star is much more dramatic than a car without petrol.Solar Eclipse ‘Elements of this image furnished by NASA 'How will our sun die?Once the hydrogen inside the sun’s core is used up, the sun will expand rapidly. It will grow and grow till it reaches the earth’s orbit. And by then, it will be so hot, that it will consume the earth too.Such a huge star is called a red giant. Our sun will eventually become a red giant star some 5 billion years from now. And this will be the beginning of the final stages of its death. Slowly, the outer surface of the red giant will dissipate leaving behind a tiny, white and shimmering core called the white dwarf star.As the white dwarf star cools down, it will reach the final stage of its evolution and become a cold and inert heavenly object. This is often called the black dwarf and will be the final stage in the life of our sun.Whenever something dies, it creates something new. The death of the sun will create new substances which will form newer stars and newer planets. The entire universe is actually made of the ashes of dead stars.",

    "title": "How Wool Came Into Existence",
    "article": "It must have been a very intelligent human who looked at a sheep walking past and thought of the use its fleece might have!Although the oldest surviving textile made out of wool is around 3,500 years old, the oldest fine woolen fabric dates to the fifth century BC (about 2,500 years ago) and was found in an ancient Greek colony.How Wool Came Into ExistenceWool was probably the first fiber to be woven into a textile. Because when primitive man stopped hunting and started herding animals, it was his first step from a primitive life to a civilised one. Sheep were sort of a stone age convenience store for the nomadic lifestyle of our primitive ancestors, a walking food supply that required little care. Sheep provided for all the basic needs – meat and milk for food, skin and bones for clothing, shelter and tools.The loose wool was less essential, but as the animals shed their coats each spring, tufts of fleece were gathered and used to soften some of life’s harder edges. Slowly, it dawned upon someone that the fleece was the best part of the sheep.Eventually, sheep destined for mutton roasts and sheep destined for fine woven rugs were distinguished, as good eating does not necessarily mean good quality wool. Early wild species of sheep had long, coarse outer hair protecting their short fleece undercoats. It is this under-layer that is desirable for textile use and has been selectively bred into modern sheep.Early civilizations tended flocks of sheep and great empires were built on the backs of sheep and their wool. Around 1800 BC the civilization of Babylonia was famous for its wool. In 45 AD, the Romans conquered Spain, where they bred their own sheep with breeds from Africa and Europe, and in the process, developed a new breed that would come to be known as the Spanish Merino, with the whitest, finest wool ever known. Today, the Merino is the most highly regarded breed in the world.Spain and Great Britain rose to power on the strength of their wool industries. The Merino sheep became so important that, during the Middle Ages, Spain dominated the wool market and accumulated great wealth. Death was the penalty for anyone caught taking a Merino sheep out of the country.Hogging all the wealth from the secrets of a fabric seem to have been the done thing in ancient times. The Chinese held onto the secret of silk for thousands of years, before Europe even got a clue about how to put two strands together. With wool, they seem to have got their revenge.",

    "title": "How are Earthquakes Recorded?",
    "article": "When an earthquake takes place, people say that it measured 6.2 or 6.5 on the scale. The scale they are referring to is the Richter Scale developed by Charles Richter in the 1930s.The Richter Scale measures the magnitude of the seismic waves or vibrations that travels across the earth’s surface. The scale uses a logarithmic formula using high-frequency data collected from seismograph stations.However, long before Richter developed his scale, a Chinese philosopher Chang Heng invented a device to measure earthquakes in 132 A.D. He constructed a large urn that had eight open-mouthed dragon-heads holding a ball each in their mouths, on the outside.Each head faced one of eight principal directions of the compass. Below each dragon-head was a toad with its mouth open.When an earthquake did occur, one or more of the eight dragon-mouths would release the ball into the open mouth of the toad below. Depending on which dragon released the ball, the direction of the earthquake was identified.After an earth-shattering rumble, one of the first question people ask is “where was it?” Unfortunately, the earth is not transparent and we can’t just see or photograph the earthquake disturbance.When an earthquake occurs, it generates an expanding wave front from the hypocentre (The calculated location of the focus of an earthquake) at a speed of several kilometres per second.Scientists have for centuries tried to device a method to study the force of these seismic waves. Before the advent of electronic instruments, scientists built large spring-pendulums to record the vibrations produced by quakes.It was only in the late 19th century that a 10-point scale was conceived by François-Alphones Forel and Michele Stefano de Rossi. In 1902, Italian volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli created a 12-point scale of intensity.Mercalli’s scale measured the intensity of shaking during an earthquake. This is calculated by inspecting the damage caused by the quake and interviewing the survivors later.However, this was not very accurate as the intensity of shaking varies from place to place and different ratings were given for the same earthquake.Unlike the Mercalli scale, the Richter scale measured the magnitude of an earthquake at its epicentre (a point on the earth’s surface directly above the hypocentre of an earthquake).Seismograph instrument recording ground motion during earthquakeThis was more accurate as there can be only one measure taken no matter where you record it. Magnitude is calculated according to the amount of energy released during the earthquake.Earthquakes are recorded by a whole network of seismographic stations located at strategic places across the world. A seismograph is a simple instrument that consists of a suspended weight with a pen attached to it. Next to the pen is a large paper roll.Under normal conditions the pen draws a straight line. As the ground vibrates due to the tension released from below the surface of the earth, energy is released and travels outward in waves.When the frame vibrates, the pen draws a zigzag pattern. This line is called a seismogram and records the amplitude of the seismic waves at the site.The ground motion at each seismograph is recorded electronically at the recording site. As the wave expands from the earthquake, it reaches more distant seismic stations. Each station measures and times the distance and time the wave front passes the station and this is then tabulated until the epicentre is located.With new technology, it became apparent that the Richter Scale was valid only for certain energy frequency and distance ranges. So scientists have developed new magnitude scales that are an extension of Richter’s original idea.These include body-wave magnitude, surface-wave magnitude, and moment magnitude. For very large earthquakes, moment magnitude gives the most reliable estimate of earthquake size.Sometimes the magnitude is reported by different networks based on only their recordings. This difference is a result of the different instruments used and their locations with respect to the earthquake epicentre.",

If there is food scarcity or predators on land, they can jump into the water and if they want to catch juicy flies they can hop back on to land.Like other amphibians, frogs are cold-blooded and prefer to live in moist climates. This means that they can regulate their body temperatures with the surrounding temperature. If it becomes too cold, some frogs burrow underground or in the mud at the bottom of marshy ponds. They can survive in a frozen state for weeks and months.The red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) is native to rainforests in Central America.But is there a difference between frogs and toads? Technically, toads are frogs and both are classified under the order Anura. Under this group, animals with a dry warty skin with short hind legs are called ‘toads’, while animals with a moist skin and long strong hind legs for swimming and jumping are called ‘frogs’.However, scientists refer to this group as frogs as there is a very thin line separating the two. For instance, there are certain frogs with a warty skin while some toads have a slimy moist skin.Both have adapted themselves admirably to their environment. They are found in all continents, from deserts to mountains to the coldest region in the Arctic. Everywhere except Antarctica. The Indian Common Toad has been found in the Himalayas at a height of 8,000 metres (26,000 feet) and the same species has also been spotted inside a coal mine at a depth of 340 m (1,100 ft).On an average, a frog is more adapted to living on water. They have strong legs with webs between the toes to help them swim. Their two front legs have four toes each, while the hind legs have five toes each. Land dwelling and tree dwelling frogs have shorter hind legs to help them in walking or climbing. Tree frogs have large, round toe pads that have suction cups like lizards, to help them cling to branches or to wet and smooth surfaces.Some frogs can fly. Well, not exactly fly, but glide. The Malayan flying frog and the Indian flying frog use their webbed feet as a parachute to glide from a treetop to the base of another tree.Frogs are voracious eaters, eating anything they find from insects and shrews to worms and smaller fish. Some frogs are vegetarians like the Indian Green Frog that eats leaves or vegetable matter, while the Indian Bull Frog is reported to eat mice, birds, other frogs and even snakes!Both frogs and toads try to blend into the surroundings they are found in. And become near invisible among the leaves and marshes unless you look very closely. However, some frogs of Central and South America do not want to camouflage themselves and instead are brilliantly coloured in yellow, orange and red. This colouring is a warning to their natural enemies to avoid eating them, as they are sometimes poisonous.It is interesting to note that there are many non-poisonous frogs that try to bluff their way through with similar colouring. Since predators avoid attacking the poisonous frogs, these non-poisonous animals too escape.Though these creatures look ugly and repulsive, frogs are very useful to mankind as they eat insects, particularly mosquitoes and flies, that we consider pests. However, their most important contribution is the secretion of certain chemical compounds from their skin.Some chemicals were recently isolated from the skin of a South American frog which led to the discovery of a painkiller that is more powerful than morphine but less addictive.",

    "title": "How are Stars Named?",
    "article": "Till now we have only seen roads, railway stations, airports, places etc. being named after famous people. But imagine paying money to get a star named after you. If that can happen, then anything is possible in this world!Well, there are organisations in different parts of the world that sell names for the stars in the sky. All you have to do is – go there, fill out the long, detailed form that they give you and buy star names or name stars after someone.However, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in France disapproves of this. It says that this practice is neither valid nor ethical. The IAU also dislikes these companies “selling” fictitious star names or “real estate” on other planets or moons in the Solar System. It says that though some stars have traditional Arabic names, most other stars have just catalogue numbers and positions on the sky.How are Stars Named?IAU explains that naming small groups of well-known bodies, like the planets or stars that can be seen by the naked eye, is fine. But there are hundreds of millions of stars. How can all be named? If they were all named, then finding any one star would be like trying to find Bank Street in India or Queen’s Road in Britain. Can you imagine doing that without a proper pin code number?Similarly for stars, having a particular pin code number, instead of a name, would help in locating them.It’s true that ‘gifting a star’ would be a unique present and would please anybody on this earth. But it is also true that the stars in the sky are for all of us to enjoy, and so they should not be for sale.So if you have a passion for the stars and the sky, then go to a planetarium and enjoy the beauty. Better still, lie down on your terrace and gaze at the starry sky. It sure is more pleasurable than spending huge sums of money just to get some fictitious star named after you.",

    "article": "Huge amounts of polluting gases are being released into the earth’s atmosphere by the large scale burning of fossil fuels or natural fuels found under the earth. These gases are the main culprits behind the phenomenon of global warming and other climatic changes.In order to find cleaner fuels, scientists around the world are trying to find a fuel or source of energy which produces little or no pollution on being burnt.Quite amazingly, a new technology points out that water can be used to generate electricity. But burning water? How is that possible?How can We Use Water to run Cars?Split water, burn water, get waterActually, the idea is amazingly simple. Water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen. Scientists plan to make a cell (gadget which produces electricity by chemical reactions), which will break water down into its two components.Take a close look at any cell, you will see that it has two sides. One side is marked with a ‘+’ and the other with a ‘-'. The side with the ‘+’ is called the anode and the other is the cathode. The fuel cell is also like that. In this, the hydrogen is passed though the anode and oxygen through the cathode. With the use of a catalyst (something that enables a chemical reaction), hydrogen produces a stream of electrons. This stream of electrons is nothing but electricity.That is not the end of the story. When hydrogen reunites with oxygen it forms water all over again. Hence the end product of the electricity generation is pure clean water.Scientists plan to create a cell which will be able to convert water into water and in the process create electricity as well. They have named this cell, the fuel cell. Along with other uses it can also be used to drive vehicles. In fact General Motors has unveiled the Precept concept car which works on a fuel cell.Does that mean that we will soon be driving around in a vehicle that uses water instead of petrol to run it? Well, if so, then it will take a long time for this to become a reality.",

    "title": "How did Christianity Come to India?",
    "article": "Would you doubt my word if I say that Doubting Thomas, one of the Apostles of Christ visited India and established Christianity? Don’t. For its true.Among Christ’s 12 apostles, Thomas Didaemus or Doubting Thomas, along with Peter and Paul were pre-eminent. Thomas Didaemus was called Doubting Thomas because he doubted Christ’s word that on the third day after his crucifixion, Christ would rise again.There are many schools of thought as to how Christianity spread in India. Some claim it is through St. Thomas who came to India in 52 A.D. Others claim that a Syrian merchant, Thomas of Cana, came to Travancore in Kerala and established a Christian colony there.Church in the backwaters of Kerala, IndiaThomas Didaemus is believed to have visited India in two phases. His first mission took him to the Parthian empire in the Indo-Scythian border province of Kandahar (now in Afghanistan). Christians believed that king Gundapar who ruled in India, allowed Thomas to preach the gospel in his kingdom.For 10 centuries, the existence of such a king was doubted. However, a large number of coins discovered in Kabul, Kandahar, and in the Punjab, bear the name of Gondophores. Research indicates that Gondophores probably ruled Peshawar between 20 and 45 A.D. However, there is no further evidence whether the first Christians were converted here or not.In his second visit to India, Thomas landed at Musiris (Cranganore) in Kerala in 52 A.D. He made his first converts of Jews and Hindus in Cranganore, Palayur and Quilon among other places.At Palayur, he organized the new coverts and appointed priests from among the leading families. Alongside he organised the erection of the first church in India at Palayur, now in Trichur district. He is also credited with establishing six other churches in India.St. Thomas then moved on to the east coast of India making conversions and crossed over to China. Returning to India he shifted base to Madras (now Chennai). But the people here did not appreciate the new religion and he was persecuted and killed in a cave in what is now called the St Thomas’ Mount in 72 A.D.Armenian Christians discovered his grave in the sixth century and a church built on the site, a village now called Mylapore, in Chennai. Traders called this village ‘Betumah’ or ‘Town of Thomas’. Marco Polo in his travels was supposed to have visited this church.In 1523, Portuguese settlers built a Church over his grave and called it San Thome after the apostle. This is now the nucleus of the present San Thome Basilica.In 1606, the Diocese of San Thome was established at the personal request of King Philip II of Portugal to Pope Paul V. In 1898, Dom Henriques Reed de Silva, the first Bishop of Mylapore, built a new neo-Gothic cathedral over the old site. is a small bone of his hand, together with a portion of bloodstained earth and head of the lance, which struck him down.However, the remains of St. Thomas were later shifted to Edessa in Iraq and later to the Greek island of Chios. From Chios they were shifted to Ortona in Italy where they remain to this day.",

    "title": "How did Sign Language Originate?",
    "article": "Have you ever seen people deep in conversation with each other without a single sound coming from their lips? Their hands and fingers move animatedly as they silently ‘speak’ sentences that sometimes you can also guess at. These people are actually conversing using sign language because they are hearing or speech impaired.Across the world, people have developed sign language to communicate with each other and with the rest of the world. Signs and gestures have always been in use. Medieval monks who have taken vows of silence, Native Americans, African bushmen and others are fluent in the art of gestures and sign language communication. These could be signs such as asking for food or water. In England, the medieval monk Venerable Bede devised a number code based on manual signs.English alphabet in sign languageIndian classical dancers also make use of a rich vocabulary of gestures called ‘mudras’. Most ‘mudras’ describe actions, such as eating, while others represent emotions, animals, even gods and goddesses. For example, by joining the thumb, the middle finger and ring finger, while the other two are fully extended, the dancer represent a deer.Sign language, as we know it today, originated in the 16th century when an Italian physician called Geronimo Cardano, decided to teach deaf people by writing a combination of symbols and associating them with the thing they represented.However, the real breakthrough came in 1755, when a French priest, Abbe Charles Michel de L’Epée, founded a school for deaf people in Paris. He developed a form of communication through a system of gestures, hand signs, and finger spelling for easy communication. The Abbe improvised his system after studying existing signs and gestures used by deaf people. This ultimately became a finger-spelt version of spoken French of the time.The L’Epée system became the forerunner of modern day French sign language. In 1816, Dr Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet adopted this system after seeing it in Paris. In 1817, the first permanent school for the deaf was established at Hartford, Connecticut in the US. This sign language was merged with various gestures already in use to form what came to be known as American Sign Language.Around the same time, in 1778 in Germany, Samuel Heinicke was working on a system to teach deaf people the science of lip reading. Heinicke developed a system of teaching through oral patterns wherein deaf people could understand words by studying the lip movements of speakers.The most important element of manual communication is the use of hands and fingers to simulate concepts and ideas or express words through finger spelling.Some gestures are universal. For example putting a finger to your head and twirling it is universally understood to mean “slightly mad”. Or the forefinger rubbed across the lips to mean “you’re lying”! Modern day sign language uses both single hand, as in the American system, or double hand spelling, as in British and other European systems.Since each country has its own sign language with gestures, an international sign language called Gestuno has been developed. In international conferences and events, Gestuno has found a ready audience.Listen spelled in sign languageSign language works beautifully between two people knowing the language. But when a hearing/speaking person who doesn’t know sign wants to ‘talk’ to a hearing-impaired person, he needs to keep some things in mind.He or she must first draw the attention of the person s/he wants to speak to so the person can see the speaker. Speak clearly without mumbling and never turn your head away while speaking. If the person cannot see your lips, you may as well be talking to a wall.Be precise and if what you say is not understood, repeat what you said without shouting. Shouting distorts the mouth and lips and it becomes difficult to lip read.Never belittle or waive a sentence off, if you think the other person hasn’t understood. The responsibility for communicating clearly lies with you.",

    "title": "How did the Modern Horse Originate?",
    "article": "Many millions of years ago a fox-like animal roamed across the plains of what is now the American continent. At that time the continents were not even divided as they are today.This animal had four soft toes on its feet like a cat or dog. This animal came to be called the ‘eohippus’ by modern day scientists who discovered skeletal fossils of this specie.Horses running in snowThe skeletal remains of this animal had many things in common with the skeletal structure of the modern horse, especially in the structure and distribution of its teeth. That is why scientists concluded that the eohippus is the ancestor of the modern horse even though the two don’t even look alike.Why did the eohippus change? In nature, animals develop according to the environment. If they had plenty to eat they increased in size. If they had to depend on speed, their leg muscles became strong. They changed colour to provide them with a natural disguise.The eohippus was a grass eater. It did not have fangs to protect itself or a hard shell like a turtle in which to hide. To escape the larger meat eaters the eohippus needed to run fast. Since it could run faster on tiptoe its outside toes were not used and became useless.Gradually the outer toes disappeared and the middle toes developed. This process of change is called mutation. After millions of years, the eohippus changed through various changes (otohippus, mesohippus, merychippus) so much that it was called ‘pliohippus’ – the first of the prehistoric horse. The pliohippus was still small but it had developed its centre toe with a thick horny nail.A million years ago, the first horse developed that resembled the modern horse. This was named ‘equus’. The equus lived in America at first, moving slowly southward. From here it shifted to Asia, Africa and Europe.From this equus four main types of horses developed, each with mane and tail and a hard hoof. In Asia, it divided itself into two types – the tarpan and Przhevalski’s horse. Both are strong sturdy animals that still look exactly as they did a million years ago.The tarpan is a stocky mouse-coloured horse with short legs, a large head with a shaggy coat against the cold. The Przhevalski’s horse (named after the Russian discoverer) or the ‘horse of the steppes’ is also short (four feet tall) and stocky.Przhevalsky horses — named after the Russian geographer and explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky.The tarpan is still very untameable and wild and both types inhabit the steppes of Russia and China, Mongolia, and the Altai mountains of central Asia.In Europe, the climate is milder than the cold barren plains of Mongolia and here developed the Equus robustus or ‘Great Horse’. This was a big strong horse that looked like the draught horses of today, the same breed that knights used to ride on with their heavy armour.In Africa and in Central Asia developed a faster moving horse and because of its agility it was called Equus agilis. From this type came the Arabian and Greek strains of horses. This was a lighter, taller, and swifter horse than the rest.Like the oxen, goat, dog, cat and other animals which man tamed and domesticated, early man found the horse very useful and he thus domesticated it.Through selective breeding, man developed different breeds of horses for different purposes, like racing, breeding, pulling carts, and so on.The very word ‘equus’ comes from the Greek word ‘acer’ meaning ‘quick’ or ‘swift’. Coincidentally, both the Mesopotamians (modern day Iraq) and ancient Indias (about three thousand five hundred years ago) called this animal – ‘asva’, meaning swift – from the Sanskrit word for horse!",

    "article": "What prompted people to call banana a banana and a pineapple a pineapple and not something else?Actually there is a reason behind the names given to each and every thing; be it a fruit, vegetable, an animal or inanimate objects like stars, planets, etc. However, sometimes the names are misleading, Take the example of pineapple: no it doesn’t come from a pine tree, nor is it an apple.When you look at a pineapple you may think you are looking at one fruit. Actually, the pineapple is a group of tightly packed small fruits!How did the Pineapple get its Name?The pineapple is native of southern Brazil and Paraguay in South America. Native Indians spread this fruit, called Ananas, through South and Central America to the West Indies. In 1493, Columbus, on his voyage to the Caribbean, found the fruit on the island of Guadaloupe.To the European eye, this curious new fruit had an abrasive, segmented exterior like a pinecone and inside the fruit had a firm interior pulp like an apple. So combining the two they called it ‘pineapple’.In Europe, sweets and fresh tropical fruit were not common. These were imported at great cost from various voyages and expeditions. In such circumstances, this ripe yellow fruit, which was bursting with natural sweetness, made the pineapple a coveted fruit. It was such a luxury that King Charles II of England posed for an official portrait where he is seen receiving a pineapple as a gift! For many years after, rich Europeans carefully grew the pineapple in private greenhouses.Today pineapple fields exist in many parts of the world, including the West Indies, Florida, Northern Africa, Hawaii and Australia. The pineapple plant grows about 2 meter high with a spread of 3 to 4 ft. It is essentially a short, stout stem with a rosette of waxy, strap like leaves and bears its fruits at any time of the year. The leaves of the pineapple plant are also useful for they contain a fibre that can be made into cloth.Pineapples are grown from new vegetative growth. Home gardeners prefer the top or the crown of the fruit. The crown is removed from the fruit by twisting until it comes free. The bottom leaves are removed and the crown is left to dry for two days, then planted.Next time your Mom makes the “Oh! So delicious pineapple pudding” for you, you can surprise her by reeling off all the details you know about the fruit – I am sure she will happily make another equally tasty dish for you!",

    "title": "How did the Safety Match Originate?",
    "article": "Fire was invented when two flint stones were struck together igniting a spark. From earliest times people made fire by either striking flint stones or by rubbing a hard stick against a soft one so that the friction caused soft flakes to peel off and start to smoulder.The only improvement on these primitive methods was the tinder box that contained some steel, flint, and some dry tinder for the spark to ignite. This tinder was often pieces of linen or silk. But this was a time-consuming process especially if the tinder was damp or cold.In the 18th century matches were invented which immediately made the process of transferring the flame from the tinder to where it was needed easier and simpler. Early matches were strips of wood or cardboard or waxed paper with one end tipped with a chemical.Initially these splinters of wood were dipped in sulphur. Sulphur was discovered much earlier and it is reported that the Chinese used such sulphur matches as early as the sixth century. However, while sulphur flared easily, it produced dangerous fumes. Though these matches became popular as they were cheap, the tinder box was still needed to produce the first spark.A breakthrough was made in 1827 by John Walker an English chemist. He invented a match that had a combination of antimony sulphide, potassium chlorate, gum arabic and starch on its head. The match burst into flames with a series of small explosions that showered the experimenter with sparks. Walker called them “friction lights” as the flame was created by friction.Old matches: Small wooden sticks with much sulfur on itBut these friction lights would sometimes ignite accidentally making them dangerous. Thankfully in 1844, a Swedish chemist Gustav E. Pasch came up with the idea of putting only some of these chemicals on the match head and the rest on the side of the box in which the matches could be kept and carried. The match then, could only be ignited when struck against the side of the box. This idea of “safety matches” was taken up and they began to be mass produced.But what do present day matches contain? Red phosphorus is the main substance used in the match industry. Matches are of two types: Lucifer or friction matches and Safety matches.Lucifer or friction matches light when rubbed against any rough surface. The match is basically a wood splint slightly longer than a normal matchstick. The tips are of two colours – red and white or blue and white.The tip of the wooden strip is first dipped in molten sulphur or paraffin wax. The small white tip is made from the paste of phosphorus trisulphide. The red tip is made of various chemicals and substances – antimony trisulphide (to act as kindling material), potassium chlorate (to support combustion), glass or silica powder (to cause friction) and gum (to act as binder).Lucifer matches can be struck against any hard surface that provides friction. When the stick is rubbed, the white tipped portion first ignites the match and when the tip has caught fire the red or blue part of the tip burns and carries the flame up the rest of the matchstick.In the case of safety matches they can only be ignited by striking them against a special surface usually located on the match box. In addition red phosphorous is used to ignite the matchstick instead of phosphorous trisulphide.Because of the fact that they easily burst into flames, Lucifer matches are no longer in general use. However, they are very popular in Westerns where cowboys are seen lighting the match on their boots, on the seat of the pants and even lighting it from their nails!",

    "article": "It was party time for the 40 giant teddy bears. They had succeeded in achieving what most fashion conscious people in the world would give their right arm and eye for: a party dress made by the most famous couturiers or dress designers on earth.And it was all for a grand auction in the tiny principality of Monaco, in Europe. On October 15, world celebrities, both rich and famous vied to make the highest bid for each of the 40 giant stuffed teddies so that their money could be donated to a charitable cause.And the next day, photographs of Princess Stephanie of Monaco could be seen cuddling next to a rather serious looking teddy.But you might say that the teddy is used to attention. After all he’s got the nickname of one of America’s most famous presidents, Theodore ‘Teddy’ Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 and under his presidency America’s stature grew in world affairs. And therein lies a tale.The year was 1902. Forty-four-year-old Roosevelt, who had stepped in to become President following the assassination of William McKinley, in 1901, was in a mood to go hunting.Having had a frail and asthmatic childhood, he had gone out of his way to lead a rough outdoors life. In 1898, during the Spanish-American war, he even led one of the toughest units, called the US Rough Riders, into Cuba.So there he was, in Mississippi on November 15, and in a mood to hunt. The presidential hunting party went after and lassoed a frail black bear and tied it to a tree to make it easy for Roosevelt to shoot the animal.The incident was made famous by cartoonist Clifford Barryman of the ‘Washington Post’ on the front page the next day. His cartoon pictured Roosevelt wearing a “cowboy” hat, standing with his back to the animal signaling his refusal to have it shot.The cartoon took America by storm, particularly a shopkeeper in New York. Morris Michtom ran a stationary and novelty store and was quick to spot a winning business opportunity. He immediately displayed two toy bears made by his wife, Rose, in his shop window.A teddy bearHe asked for and was granted permission by the president to call his bears “Teddy’s Bears”. The rest, as we say, is history, for Teddy’s bears became an instant success. They have remained so to this day, coming in all sizes and levels of softness.For Michtom, it was time to ride on the success of the stuffed toy and expand his store under the name of Ideal Novelty and Toy Corporation.Coincidentally, a stuffed bear made its appearance in Germany at the same time (1902-1903). Made by Margaret Steiff of the Steiff company, it was displayed commercially for the first time during a business fair at Leipzig, Germany, in 1903.The stuffed bear attracted the curiosity of an American who ordered a couple of thousands to take back with him.What must he have felt on landing in America with his bears and then seeing similar teddy bears sold all over! Can you guess?",

    "article": "Remember the last time you played hide and seek. You hid behind a bush while your friend tried to find you. If you were wearing a green dress, the chance of you being seen was automatically reduced as you could be mistaken for a bunch of leaves.Hide and seek is a very old game and it seems human beings are not the only ones to play it. Small fish use the tactics of the game to hide from bigger ones, while moths and butterflies use them to hide from birds and other attackers.A well-camouflaged rockfish is hard to discern from the backgroundSome creatures have colours that help them to merge with their surroundings, while others change their colour to do the same. This is known as camouflage.Butterfly camouflage: this butterfly merges with the bark of the treeThe wings of some butterflies, like the curve-toothed geometer, look like leaves. They even have leaf-like veins on them. This allows the butterfly to blend into the foliage on a tree without a trace. Similarly, a goatweed butterfly fades seamlessly into a leaf litter. Some species of tree frogs can change their colour to match the colour of the trees they are sitting on.Snake camouflage: A copperhead snake is hard to see when coiled among leaf litter on the forest floor.How does an animal change its colourAll living organisms are made up of tiny building blocks called cells. All the organs of our body like the heart, lungs and even the skin, are made of these cells. A certain type of these skin cells called melanophore cells carry small packets of colours called pigments. These impart colour to the skin.Chameleons are known for their quick color-changing abilities. But it is not necessarily for camouflage. Thy also use their color changing ability to signal their intentions to others and also to regulate their temperaturesThe green garden lizard owes its colour to the green pigment in its skin. These cells are controlled by the nervous system, which changes the concentration of pigments whenever needed. The colour changes depend on several factors such as the presence of light, temperature of the atmosphere, emotions like fright and a sense of danger.So, the next time you see a war movie and find the soldiers wearing green uniform and have leaves stuck to their uniform, you will know what they are trying to do.",

    "article": "Humans have invented new and advanced ways of communicating with each other. Television, radio, telephones and of course email. You will be surprised to know that animals who seem to have very simple methods of communication – using their bodies and voices – are also capable of long distance communication.Foot stomping and low frequency rumbling created by elephants can travel upto 20 miles and is used by elephants to signal other herds or members, says an article in the Hindu newspaper.Seismic communicationAn elephant often launches a mock charge along with stomps, frantic screaming and ear flapping if it feels threatened. Elephant researchers have discovered that there is more to such a mock charge than obvious to the eye.Foot stomping and low-frequency rumbling generate waves in the ground that can travel nearly 20 miles along the surface of the Earth, the article said quoting a study in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA).It is even more surprising to know that elephants may be able to sense these vibrations through their feet and interpret them as warning signals of a distant danger. These waves travel from their toe nails to the ear via their bones and special receptors (nerves which can receive signals like those in our ear) in the foot. This way elephants may be able to communicate over long distances, says the study.Asian elephant couple in embraceOther animals known to communicate through such seismic signals include the golden mole, the elephant seal and a variety of insects, fishes and reptiles.Fin whales are known to produce low frequency sounds which are used to communicate with other members who may be miles away. Researchers have found that even elephants can produce such sounds and use them as a method of communicating with other herds.Caitlin O’ Connell-Rodwell, author of the JASA study points out that elephants can use their body like an antenna to sense the environment.",

    "title": "How do Chameleons Latch on to Prey Using Just Their Tongue?",
    "article": "Have you ever seen a chameleon flick its tongue at a fly? Well, this small reptile with a foot long body has an extremely long tongue. Its nearly three-fourths the length of its body!A chameleon can launch its tongue out at targets up to two body lengths away. It flicks its tongue and can snap its prey in 1/25th of a second! This is faster than you can blink your eye!Once the tongue makes contact with a prey, the prey gets attached to the sticky tongue like glue. The chameleon then withdraws its tongue, with the prey firmly attached into its mouth. The chameleon’s sticky tongue is capable of gripping anything – sometimes even lassoing lizards nearly the same size as itself.How do Chameleons Latch on to Prey Using Just Their Tongue?Biologists have often wondered how chameleons manage to latch on to larger animals using just this sticky adhesive power. Chameleon tongues aren’t big enough, or for that matter, sticky enough, to bag big prey with mere adhesion.Recent research has revealed the secret of how a chameleon’s tongue sticks and grips its prey – the tongue latches itself on to its victims with suction. The muscles beneath the tip of a chameleon’s tongue, forms a flat pad at rest, but turns into a conical depression when in flight acting like a suction cup.A study carried out over an extended period of time was recently released in a Biology journal – the reaction of the chameleon’s tongue on a hollow straw and a sealed straw were observed.Since the former allowed air to enter – the suction effect was less obvious, however the chameleon clung with two-and-a-half times the strength to the sealed straw, due to airtight conditions.Ten species of chameleons from Africa and Madagascar were put through this test and the team of international scientists arrived at the same conclusion. Since the chameleon is not a very fast moving animal, its tongue’s ability to adhere to objects is essential for the survival of the species.Chameleons belong to the lizard family and are well known for their ability to change colours. This sudden change in skin colour occurs when the reptile is frightened, or in reaction to light and temperature changes.Hormones that affect special pigment-bearing cells in the skin cause the chameleons to ‘change colour’. Contrary to popular belief, the colour-change does not always match the surroundings.",

    "article": "When you get out of the swimming pool or bathtub, you are soaking wet. Had you been a duck, you would be swimming in water and yet not look really wet. It sounds crazy, but it’s true.The secret lies in the layer of smooth feathers, which keeps the water out and also helps the duck float. Moreover, these smart ducks make a kind of oil, which they spread on their feathers with their beaks. And since oil and water do not mix, the water just rolls off their bodies. Isn’t it a bit like having your cake and eating it too?A colorful male mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), eurasian wild duck. The Mallard is a medium-sized waterfowl and is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks.Ducks have their special swimming gear, like humans, but it is certainly not a lifejacket or a swimsuit. It has to do with the kind of feet they have – broad feet on which the skin stretches between the toes. They Ducks use these feet as paddles in water. But their short legs and webbed feet are not so good for walking on land.",

    "title": "How do Earthquakes Happen?",
    "article": "Simply put, the shaking of the earth caused by a sudden shifting of rocks below its surface, is called an earthquake. The earths crust or outermost layer, is not made of one single piece of solid rock. It is actually made up of independent sheets of rocks called tectonic plates.The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century.These plates slide against each other, giving rise to physical changes in the earths topography. The places where these tectonic plates meet each other, are called fault lines.To understand what happens when two plates slide against each other, try out this experiment:Break a thick block of thermocol into half, and place the two pieces on a smooth table.Put the rough edges of the thermocol pieces together.First put a light pressure to push the two pieces together.Almost at the same time, push the thermocol under your right palm away from your body, and pull the other piece toward yourself. See how they stick?Keep pushing and pulling, increasing the pressure with each stroke. See the thermocol pieces give a sudden jerk – a little piece will fall from the crack (the fault). Then the two pieces will suddenly slip past each other.That sudden jerk and breaking away of the thermocol is the earthquake. That’s just what happens along a fault.",

    "title": "How do Flush Toilets Work?",
    "article": "Toilets are an amazing invention. Nearly every home has at least one. It is a very necessary utility needed in all homes to maintain hygiene. It is really amazing how this system works – you press a lever or pull a chain and whoosh! About two gallons of water rushes down into the porcelain bowl in three and four seconds. Gurgle-gurgle-urp it is clean and ready for use again!Toilets were known in India as early as three thousand years ago! Excavations at Harappa revealed drainage facilities with effective sanitation. However, the Chinese were the first to use flush toilets. Archaeologists found a two thousand year old antique latrine belonging to the Han Dynasty complete with running water, a stone seat and a comfortable armrest. It was a fact that French king Louis XIII had his toilet fashioned after his throne.A collection of flush toilets or water closet as they are called in some parts of the world.The toilet is a simple mechanism. Let’s plunge into the depths of the toilet tank to know how it works. Does your toilet have a tank that is visible? Remove the cover and take a look inside. You can see a float ball attached to a handle and a U-shaped tube protruding from the water.Whatever the design, every toilet commode consists of a bowl, the flushing mechanism and, a refill mechanism.The basic toilet mechanism is the bowl. Even without a tank to flush water, the bowl does all the functions a toilet needs to perform. Most Indian homes have only the bowl which is called an Orissa Pan.The bowl is attached to a pipe with a U-bend to the sewer. When you pour a bucketful of water in the bowl, the water comes in fast. The excess water goes through the bend and is sucked out and sent to the sewer pipe. As water empties out the bowl, air rushes in and this makes the distinct recognizable gurgling or “flush” sound. The air then stops the siphoning process.However the siphon doesn’t work if you pour a glassful of water. The water level does not rise as the excess water spills into the bend immediately.The tank attached just above the bowl acts like a reservoir. It stores enough water to send it fast enough into the bowl to activate the siphon. The tank takes a minute or so to fill up. When you press the lever or pull the chain all the water in the tank is dumped into the bowl in less than three seconds that is equal to pouring in a bucket of water.The chain or lever is connected to the flush valve. It lifts the flush valve allowing water to slip through a drain hole. The drain hole is connected to the bowl and water flows in. As the tank of water enters the bowl rapidly it fills and activates the siphon and all the water and waste in the bowl is sucked out.As the tank empties, the flush valve goes back to cover the drain hole. Now water comes into the tank to refill it.Here is where the float ball comes in. The float ball is connected to a valve that automatically turns the water on and off. When the water in the tank reaches a certain level it holds up the ball so it floats level, shutting off the refilling mechanism. When the tank is empty the float ball falls free allowing the valve to open and fill the tank.In the house, the toilet is the largest consumer of water as it washes down nearly 2.2 gallons at every flush. Considering the lack of adequate drinking water in most parts of the world it is perhaps best if we all shift over to gassifiers, a new water-free system of waste disposal scientists are working on.",

    "title": "How do Houseflies Spread Diseases?",
    "article": "The housefly (musca domestica) is one of the most common of all insects. It is a major health hazard, particularly in parts of the world where sanitary conditions are poor.The housefly has a dull gray, bristled body that is about 7 mm in length. It has large reddish compound eyes. Its mouth cannot bite but consists of a spongy pad.It has a peculiar system of feeding itself. At first it releases saliva and digestive juices over food and then sponges up the resulting solution. One can well imagine what we are eating after a fly are taken a ‘sip’ of our food.Because of the way they eat, flies contaminate large amounts of food. They carry germs of several deadly diseases and cause millions of deaths every year.Another way that the housefly contaminates food is by rubbing its legs together. Do you know why it does so?The whole body of the housefly, including claws and padded feet, is covered with bristles. Its tongue is coated with sticky glue. A fly rubs its legs together to clean itself. In the process of rubbing its legs, it rubs off scraps of some of the material that has gathered on its bristles.How do houseflies spread diseases?This is how it drops germs of dangerous diseases on our food. When we eat this food we may get infected. Some of the most common diseases spread by the housefly are typhoid, tuberculosis and dysentery, all of which, if left untreated even for a short while, can cause death.Flies gather such germs from garbage and sewage, where they usually live and breed. The female lays about 100 eggs at a time and as many as 1000 during her lifetime. The eggs hatch into larvae in 12 to 30 hours.Within a few days, the pupae become adults and the cycle begins again. Most houseflies have a lifespan of about 30 days during summer and longer when the weather is cooler. Cold weather usually kills off the adults, but larvae and pupae are able to survive the winter.",

    "title": "How do Human Cannonballs Fly?",
    "article": "Even been to a circus where they featured a human cannonball? A person enters a huge cannon and when the fuse is lit, he comes shooting out with a bang, flying in the air before landing on a net!My god! I thought that was the most horrifying thing I had ever seen. What a crazy thing to do. How does he do it without being blown to pieces, I would wonder.Though scary, it was one of the most captivating items for me, and the hundreds of children and adults who would watch the circus item with their mouths open.Then the questions came cannoning into our minds: how does the human cannonball fly? How can this man not be blown to pieces when that cannon fires? Was there a catch somewhere?Yet, the cannon was real as we kids went and touched it. It was only recently that I interviewed a circus clown and got the answer to this childhood mystery.The cannonball run is more or less equal to the girl who is cut into two by a knife in a magic trick. The danger of a mishap is there but hours of practice have made the trick perfect.For trick is what it is. Human cannonballs are not blasted into space from the cannon with gunpowder. They’re shot into space, catapulted with the help of compressed air. The loud bang, flash and smoke are supplied by fire crackers that makes you believe that the cannon was fired!How do human cannonballs fly?The first human cannonball was a woman called Zazel who performed this trick on April 2, 1877 in London. Zazel used hidden coils of springs and enthralled the audience. The released springs propelled the ‘ball’ in the same principle that works with the pogo stick.Soon, others, too, caught up and various devices were tried out and used.Today, those who do the trick prefer to use compressed air to propel the human cannonball. The ‘cannonball’ climbs into the cannon. Inside the cannon, at the bottom, is a cylinder holding compressed air.When compressed air is released, the cylinder moves forward, propelled like a bullet that stops just short of the mouth of the cannon. The ‘ball’ is shot forward due to the momentum of the cylinder and lands about 100 feet away on to a net.This is an extremely dangerous sport and like any other risky action venture, it has a high accident rate. Though the distance that the human cannon is estimated to travel is measured and a net is tied across, sometimes the ‘ball’ does overshoot or fall short due to human error.It happened once with two human cannonballers. They were launched simultaneously from two opposing ends. However, instead of passing each other by in this daredevil act, they collided in mid-air and one of them ended with a broken back.Even if accidents can be avoided with excess precaution, the force at which the person is projected at such speeds cause blackouts that doctors worry may lead to brain damage.This sport is still popular in the United States as seen from the Discovery channel coverage. Stuntmen perform at select venues and even try to set world records in how much distance they can cover.",

    "title": "How do Humans Balance on Two Legs?",
    "article": "Four-year-old Rohit couldn’t understand why his parents and grand parents were so happy on seeing his 10-month-old sister, Ruchi, take a few unsteady steps towards her favorite toy. What was so unusual about her walking -after all, he could walk and run without anyone’s help, yet no one ever clapped nor hugged him, the way they were doing it for his sister.Unable to hold his curiosity any longer he decided to talk about it to his closest friend and guide – his mother. His mother explained him unlike animals, human children cannot stand on their own feet soon after birth. They take time to do so.Wandering indian tightrope walker on a beach in Goa. Katoosha / Shutterstock.comLike most animals, babies too are dependent on their parents to teach them everything. Animals teach their puppies what to eat, how to search for food, who are enemies and who are friends.Similarly, humans too teach their babies a lot of things. A human child cannot do things on his own till he is at least 3-4 years old.The most difficult task of all is to teach the child to balance himself/herself on both their feet and eventually walk. What seems so easy for Rohit now, required lot of hard work and dedication on the part of his parents.Giving it serious thought Rohit felt that just being able to stand up or to walk, was one of the most amazing tricks that he had learnt! It is a trick that every human being has to learn. In fact if ever any animal was bestowed with the power to think, it would be amazed at the way it can do this balancing act without even being taught how to!When you stand still you are performing a constant act of balancing. You change from one leg to the other, you use pressure on your joints, and your brain tells your nerves and muscles in your legs to go this way and that way.Can you believe that just to stand still we use 300 muscles of our body? That is one reason why we get tired when we stand for long. Our muscles are constantly at work. In fact, standing is work.While walking, we not only use our balancing trick, but we also make use of two natural forces to help us. The first is air pressure. Our thighbone fits into the socket of the hip joint so snugly that it creates a sort of vacuum. The air pressure on our legs helps keep it there securely. This air pressure also makes the leg hang from the body as if it has very little weight.The second natural force we use while walking is the pull of the earth’s gravity. After our muscles have raised our leg, the earth pulls it downwards again, and it keeps swinging like a pendulum.So next time you see an acrobat walking across a tightrope and balancing himself, remember he is doing a more difficult trick of balancing than you do every day. And like you, he had to learn and practice it for a long, long time.",

    "title": "How do Nails Grow?",
    "article": "Put your hands face down and look at the fingernails on your hand. Are they long or short? Dirty? Covered with polish? And the nails on your toes? Are they tearing up your socks? When my nails do that to my socks I know that it is time to get hold of a nail trimmer to cut them down to size.Meanwhile, my sister wants to show hers off. So she spends hours every day polishing her nails endlessly. She wants to look different. But whatever people do to their nails – paint them, cut them, grow or colour them – yours, hers, mine and everybody else’s nails are made of the same material called keratin.Keratin is the same protein that makes up hair and the outer layer of the skin. Nails look as if they grow only from the tips of the fingers or toes and this is the portion, which we cut or trim.But in fact, nails start growing from the nail bed, a small surface that is just below where your nail disappears into your fingers or toes. Like hair, nails, too, are attached to tiny blood vessels that feed it.The anatomy of a human nailThe blood gives the nail the pale pink colour and when you press the flesh of your fingertip, you can see the nail becoming pinker and pinker as blood rushes in below it.Nail cells multiply under the skin. Each cell keeps dividing and creating more cells. The new cells push the old cells above the skin surface.Once the nail cells are out on the surface, they are pushed from below by new nail cells, towards your finger or toe. However, once they come out they lose the ability to multiply. They become dead cells.Nails grow very slowly – and fingernails grow faster than toenails. The root of the nail where it appears on your skin is called the cuticle. Cuticles help to protect the new formed nail and the nail bed. At the tip where the nail comes out of the skin is a whiter half-moon shaped structure called the lunula.Nails protect the fingertips and toes and help you grab things.Multicoloured nails of a young woman.They need to be trimmed weekly. When you play or scratch, tiny particles of dust and dirt get under the nail and skin. This may mix with your food if you do not clean your hands properly, and cause diseases.Biting or chewing nails is a common habit, but it could lead to an infection. Sometimes people are forced to work with paints, chemicals, or oil. They should be careful as chemicals weaken the nails.Similarly, the nail polish removers that are commonly used can also weaken the nails, so one must always be careful when using them.When trimming nails, one must be careful to trim it straight. If nails are cut in a curve, the edges tend to poke through the skin and flesh. This causes a painful condition especially in toes called in-grown nails. When this happens surgery may be necessary to help ease the pain.Nails normally get broken off if grown over a certain length. However, the record in nail growth is held by an Indian from Pune, called Shridhar Chillal. The nails of his left hand measure a total of 242 inches.Chillal’s thumb nails are the longest at 56 inches! He hasn’t cut his nails since 1952 and takes great care to see that they remain unbroken.",

    "title": "How do Satellites Stay Up?",
    "article": "Satellites orbit the earth because of the force of gravity. To understand why this happens and why the satellite does not get pulled in and fall, we have to understand what forces do. A force will change the motion of an object; it might speed it up, slow it down or change its direction. For example, if you are running and someone pushes you from behind, you speed up (the force is in the direction of your motion). But if someone pushes you in the chest when you are running, you slow down (the force is in the opposite direction to your motion). If you are running and someone pushes you from the side, you move away from them, changing your direction. (the force is at right angles to the motion). This idea is calledNewton’s First Law.To make something move in a circle it must be moving and have a force that is always at right angles to the motion so that it constantly changes direction. This force is called the centripetal force.How do Satellites Stay Up?Imagine swinging a rock on a string around your head. The tension in the string pulls the rock round in a circle (this is the force at right angles to the motion). So the tension is the centripetal force. If we cut the string, the rock will continue in a straight line because there is no longer a force to change its direction. For a satellite, the centripetal force is the gravitational force, the pull of the earth. If we could switch gravity off, we would lose all our satellites as they move off in straight lines!Going back to the rock example, we need to put energy into keeping the rock moving because the rock is moving through air and is losing energy constantly because of air resistance. We don’t need to do this with satellites because they are moving through space where there is no air, so no air resistance acts on the satellites and they don’t slow down.Many people think there is a centrifugal force acting which pulls the satellite (or rock) outwards. This is not the case; there is no such thing as a centrifugal force. Imagine riding in the back seat of a car as it turns the corner. Let us assume the back seat is very slippery and you don’t have a seatbelt on. As the car turns the corner, you slide from the inside to the outside. You could argue that a force is pushing you outwards. In fact the reason you move outwards is that there is no force keeping you moving in the same circle as the car. What you really do is continue in a straight line. Eventually you will hit the far door and the door then pushes you providing the centripetal force to keep you moving in the same circle as the car. If the car door was open you would not have a centripetal force acting and you would continue in a straight line out of the car! (Don’t try this at home!)",

    "title": "How do Spiderwebs Help Skydivers?",
    "article": "While dusting the house have you ever cross jhalis (webs) in the corners of the wall? Sometimes you may come across them under table corners or at rarely used places. Yes, the webs are woven by spiders.It’s a nuisance clearing them for just when you manage to remove one sticky web, the spider scurries off to a corner to spin yet another!But before you destroy these webs with a sweep of the broom, here’s some food for thought – you are about to dismantle one of the strongest structures in the natural world!Once caught in a spider web, even insects that are larger and stronger than spiders cannot escape from these silken threads. Spiders are very useful creatures around the house as they trap flies, mosquitoes and other pests in their webs and eat them.However, when a web gets wet it can shrink to as little as 55 per cent of its original length. Now, for a spider that is good news since old droopy webs will self-tighten when it rains.Scientists and researchers have tried to work on the same principle to design parachutes of super strong spider silk. But they were going nowhere, for while such a parachute would be incredibly strong but at the same time lightweight, a jumper unfortunate enough to get caught in stormy weather would plunge to his death as the silk would shrink!Dew drops on a spiderwebMeanwhile, new research by American scientists doing a chemical analysis of spider silk revealed that the most probable cause of shrinkage was a certain arrangement of 11 molecules known as amino acids.The team then managed to figure out a similar string of molecules that could replace the amino acid block, thus resulting in a silk that’s just as strong but not as water sensitive as to shrink.Skydivers in mid air formationBut this is rather complicated and will involve inserting the required arrangement into the spider – a process known as genetic coding.Perhaps in the near future we shall soon see spiders and humans working together, the spider spinning its silk and the human weaving it to make a parachute.",

    "article": "To many of us, building a house of ice doesn’t sound too good. One might wake up from a good night’s sleep to see it melted. All these things don’t matter to Eskimos, who live in north Canada, Greenland and Alaska. They build igloos or houses of ice knowing that they will not melt. At least, not till winter passes by. The reason is that the walls are made in a special way so that they become rock hard.How do they Make an Igloo?Building an igloo takes about a couple of hours. It is made in the shape of a dome. First, they cut a trench or pit. It is about 1.5 metres long and 50 centimetres deep in the snow. Then they cut blocks of snow from the trench and place it around the trench in a circle. These blocks are shaped in such a way that they lean inward when one is kept on the other. Their edges are trimmed so that the circumference slowly reduces, forming a dome-shaped structure. The blocks are cut from the inside of the house as the man works. Then a big block, which is wider than the rest, is put on top. All the cracks are filled with soft snow.After the main structure has been built, the woman gets into the house and lights a lamp. She lets it burn till it is really hot. Then she closes the door with a block of ice making the structure airtight. This way the lamp’s heat is trapped inside and the snow begins to melt. But, because the dome’s roof is curved, it does not drip. Instead, it gradually soaks into the blocks so that they become wet.How do they Make an Igloo?When the blocks are sufficiently wet, she puts out the lamp and opens the door, letting in a gush of cold air. This draught of biting cold air freezes the melting snow and the fragile structure made of ice blocks becomes a strong dome of ice. It becomes so strong that a polar bear can crawl on it without breaking it.",

    "title": "How does a Juggler Juggle?",
    "article": "Yesterday, after seeing a circus show, I made up my mind about a career. I was at home busy throwing an orange in the air with one hand to catch it while the other hand was passing me a second orange. I wanted to juggle oranges the same way a clown juggles balls.I could manage it with two. But my hand started to fumble when it came to the third. The clown we saw yesterday was throwing plates in the air and I knew my mother would kill me if I broke any!A clown juggles ballsJuggling is something one sees at a circus. It is a performing art and quite difficult as I soon found out. So how do people master this art? Down the ages, there have been jugglers. In fact ancient Egyptians used to have jugglers. In a tomb unearthed at Egypt, there are pictures of a juggler dating to the Middle Kingdom period, roughly 1994 BC to 1781 BC (more than 3,700 years ago.)In the 20th century, studies have been conducted to understand the art of juggling. In the 1970s, researchers at the world-famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in America, investigated how people master the art of juggling. The MIT juggling club, one of the oldest organisations devoted to juggling, was established.A juggler juggles large knives while another artist lays flat in the path of a possible miss. Avignon Theater Festival in Avignon, France. sansa55 / Shutterstock.comAll amateurs start with juggling two or three balls in a “shower” or circle pattern with one hand throwing and the other catching. However, it is far easier to learn juggling if they attempt it by throwing the balls alternately with both hands in the “cascade” or the figure eight pattern.Depending on one’s skill, it may take hours or days to learn to juggle three balls. The time increases to months to move on to four balls and years to master five or more object!Someone has even set a world record in juggling: 12 rings, 11 balls and eight clubs. Actually it is easier to juggle rings and balls than clubs as the weight and grip also affects the rhythm of the thrower.The main drawback is gravity, which limits the number of objects one can juggle at a time. Each object (ring, ball, club, plates, knives, etc) must be thrown high enough to allow the juggler time to deal with the other objects. The more the objects, more the height and speed necessary to keep it in the air.Errors in timing the object or in throwing are the most common mistakes a juggler makes. If thrown low, the catch must be quick and it doesn’t leave time to correct mistakes. A higher throw does give more time but it also effectively shows up the mistakes you make to the audience.Professionals use the low-throw technique. These jugglers also tend to concentrate on the object at its highest arc of the throw. They are thus, able to judge where and when the object would land. Any subsequent errors in the throw must therefore be anticipated in the catch.To start with, one can start with bounce-juggling. You can bounce balls off the floor and catch it rather than throw it in the air. This is easier as the balls are caught at the lowest speed.So, now that you are better informed on juggling, try it out. You only stand to miss a few balls. However, don’t try oranges as I found to my cost. In passing them from hand to hand, I gripped one too tightly and squished sticky juice all over my pants!",

    "title": "How does a Nuclear Bomb differ from a Conventional Bomb?",
    "article": "Every now and then we hear of countries of the world carrying out heated discussions about nuclear bombs. The topics range from who has the right to own a nuclear bomb and who does not, who should use it and who must not and so on. But what exactly happens when such a bomb actually explodes? And how are nuclear bombs different from conventional bombs?The greatest difference between the two types of bombs is the sheer scale of destruction they cause. While a conventional bomb can be targetted to damage a particular area and the people living there, nuclear bombs are weapons of mass destruction. Just consider this: a 1 megaton (million ton) nuclear bomb is enough to wipe out the largest city on Earth. (1 ton=1000 kilograms)How does a Nuclear Bomb differ from a Conventional Bomb?Conventional Bomb versus Nuclear BombA conventional bomb releases most of its energy in the form of blast. Atomic bombs on the other hand, release 50 per cent energy as blast, 35 per cent as heat and 15 per cent as nuclear radiation. You could get an idea as to how disastrous a nuclear bomb could be, by this simple comparison: one kilogram of nuclear fission fuel can release energy 20,000,000 times more than one kilogram of TNT (tri-nitro-toluene), the explosive material used in conventional bombs.How does a Nuclear Bomb differ from a Conventional Bomb? [The Indian Case For Disarmament]How devastating?When a nuclear bomb explodes, most people within a radius of three to thirty miles would either get killed or seriously injured. The possible burn out in towns and cities could be as large as 100 square kilometres for a 1 megaton explosion.Heat and BlastSmall or large, all nuclear blasts create fireballs with temperatures exceeding 300,000 degrees celsius. These fireballs act as shock waves that blow down everything in their path for many kilometres around. The explosion also results in hurricane winds and firestorms over large areas.RadiationIn addition to great heat and blast, nuclear bombs also result in radiation in the form of gamma rays, neutrons and alpha and beta particles. Radioactive reactions of a nuclear blast generally occur in two ways.The first is an immediate radioactivity pulse, which can kill people on the spot if the dose is high enough.The second form is persistent radioactivity or one that continues to be present even after the blast. This is produced partly from unused fuel, partly from radioactive decay products of the fuel generated during the explosion, and partly from materials that absorb radiation.All of these together constitute radioactive ‘dust’ or fallout. After the blast is over, this radioactive dust hangs in the atmosphere. As it is spread all around by wind and rain, it contaminates water and air. These contaminated elements are consumed by plants and thus enter into the bodies of other organisms in the food chain. So even when the blast itself is finished, living beings continue to suffer from its after-effects.Many of these components emit radiation for really large periods of time, ranging for a thousand years or more.Effects of radioactivity on living organismsRadioactivity is a powerful energy and can damage the organs it passes through. These include the DNA, cells, blood cells, and the skin.Exposure to nuclear weapon radiation leads to ill-health and malfunctioning of the body. It damages the cells involved in reproduction, can cause still-births, and genetic damages.Thus, unlike any conventional weapons of warfare, the damage caused by nuclear weapons is not limited either in space, or, even more critically, in time.Nuclear weapons leave effects that pass from one generation to another. And they do not respect any borders for the water, soil and air they pollute know no boundaries. That is something that most countries lose sight of.Source: Compiled from ‘Out of Nuclear Darkness’; The Indian Case For Disarmament; published by Movement In India For Disarmament",

    "title": "How does a Submarine Work?",
    "article": "Jules Verne in his science fiction, 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, mentions a ship, Nautilus, which could dive beneath the waves and surface again when it wanted to.Even before submarines were thought about, Verne had created the blueprint of this technological marvel. Not only did he describe the machine, but he also explained, in great detail, how it worked. In fact, today’s submarines use exactly the same technology as Verne’s Nautilus did!How does a Submarine Work?How does a submarine float and dive under water at will?Try a little experiment. Take an empty mug and turn it upside down. Now try and push the mug inside a bucket full of water. You will have to apply a lot of pressure to do so. But once you release the pressure, the mug simply floats back to the top.Air is lighter than waterThe mug resurfaces because the air trapped inside it makes the mug lighter than water. This makes the mug float. Similarly, a submarine has huge tanks called ballast tanks. The air in them allows the submarine to float.How does a Submarine Work?When a submarine has to dive, the ballast tanks are filled with sea water. This makes the submarine heavy and it sinks.When the submarine has to resurface, the water is pumped out of the ballast tanks and compressed air is forced in. Once the tanks are filled with air, the submarine becomes light again and begins to float.",

    "title": "How does the Lotus Flower Clean itself?",
    "article": "How will you explain the meaning of purity to someone? Well, many people do it by giving the example of the lotus — it grows in muddy waters but the flower remains spotless. It is not surprising that the lotus has a special or sacred place in world religions like Hinduism and Buddhism. It is a symbol of purity, and many a time gods are shown seated on lotus thrones. Now a group of German Scientists has discovered that the lotus plant is truly spotless. It does not allow any dirt to remain on its surface. And there is a clear reason for it.Lotus leaves are round and large and it is almost impossible to get them wet. You may splash as much water as you want on a lotus leaf, but the droplets immediately roll off. What makes this water plant’s leaves water repellent?Scientists have always known that aquatic leaves secrete or give out wax crystals. These crystals help prevent the leaves from getting flooded with the water around the leaves. They also help the leaves retain the required amount of moisture. The leaves are able to do this because wax repels water.Now the scientists have discovered that these leaf surfaces have an amazing ability to clean themselves. Scientists at the University of Bonn carried out extensive research to show that the water droplets rolling off a lotus leaf carry away dirt particles leaving the surface perfectly clean. This phenomena has been named the ‘Lotus Effect’ and works best on rough surfaces. A report on the scientists’ study was published in the journal ‘Planta’.The leaves of a lotus flower repeal water (superhydrophobicity) leading to self-cleaning properties, sometimes called the lotus effect.Contrary to popular belief, lotus leaves are not smooth at all. When examined under a powerful microscope, the leaf cells show a bumpy surface. That makes the surface rough. As a result, dirt particles rest only on the tips of wax crystals coating the leaf surface. The roughness reduces the contact area between the particles and the leaf surface.A rough surface structure with wax crystals makes it impossible for water to stick. Due to the friction, the water contracts at once. It forms spherical droplets to minimise the contact area with the rough, waxy leaf surface and runs off the leaf very quickly. Since the dirt particles only rest on the tips of the wax crystals they stick more strongly to the water droplets than to the leaf surfaces. They are washed away when the water falls on the leaves.On smooth leaves, the dirt particles are pushed from one part of the leaf to the other. This is because the dirt particles have a larger contact area where they can rest comfortably on the flat surface. We must also keep in mind that water usually spreads and only partially runs off the leaves — that too, only if the leaf is tilted! The dirt particles may get dislodged, but they are mainly displaced from one side of the leaf to the other.Scientists say that the Lotus Effect is particularly beneficial for it helps to protect the lotus leaves from harmful bacteria. The dirt particles on the leaves often contain tiny disease causing fungi and bacteria. While most of the bacteria get washed off, the few that remain eventually perish since they do not get the water they require for survival and growth.",

    "article": "Fruity, musk, floral, woodsy&mldr; believe it or not, the human nose can detect the difference between nearly 1,000 different odours. Our nose is very sensitive to delicate variations in smell. To cater to the need ‘to smell good’, perfume manufacturers churn out innovative new fragrances all the time. Perfume manufacturers spend a lot of money on making a perfume, research, bottling and advertisements. That’s not all, sometimes they even put the fragrance on a page in a popular magazine so that readers can sample the scent. A bit like a sniff preview!Since the smell is released by rubbing or scratching the paper surface, this method is popularly known as ‘scratch and sniff’Smell spell: a new way to sellDo you know how they perfume paper? No, they do not spray the page with perfume. If they did that, the smell wouldn’t stay. It would vanish by the time you buy the magazine. Actually the ‘scented’ paper is coated with teeny capsules that contain the perfume. These itsy-bitsy containers cannot be seen with the naked eye. They can only be seen under a microscope.The capsules are made of a delicate plastic that breaks easily when rubbed or scratched. This technique is known as microencapsulisation (pronounced mykro-n-capsu-lie-sation. Where micro means ‘small’ and encapsulisation means ‘within a capsule’.)Sometimes perfume manufacturers use a different, less complicated method. They mix the perfume essence with water and use a machine, with an extremely fine nozzle, to spray minute water droplets on the paper surface.These fine droplets are then covered with a very thin plastic sheet. When the reader rubs a finger on the highlighted portion of the page, the protective plastic coating breaks and releases a whiff of the perfume.",

    "article": "Swimmers, who are in a lazy mood and want to relax, prefer floating on their backs. Did you know that there is a bug that swims on its back? It is called the Backswimmer. It is about 0.13 to 0.63 inches long.Unlike many other insects who use their wings for this purpose, the backswimmers make use of their hind legs to paddle on their backs. Some of them have hair on their legs which help them to swim. It provides a larger surface area to push against the water.The hind legs of the bug function like the oars used by the boatmen. Therefore, at times, these bugs are called ‘Great-water Boatmen’ or just boat bugs. They are so smart that they swim on their hind legs and use their front legs to catch prey. They usually feed on small fish, tadpoles and small insects.The backswimmers can stay under water for about six hours, by holding air between the wings and the body.After they catch the prey, they use their sharp beaks to pierce its body and suck its juices. At times, the boat bugs even bite humans.The backswimmers can stay under water for about six hours, by holding air between the wings and the body. They use this air when they go under water.The backswimmer hibernates throughout winter, much like the polar bear. It buries itself in the mud at the bottom of a stream or pond.",

They are brothers! The bamboo is the largest member of the grass family.It grows in Asia, South America and Africa. It has about 500 different varieties. They all have smooth, hollow jointed stems with a strong watertight partition at each joint. While most flower every year, there are some that flower only three or four times in a 100 years.Their flowers are like that of grains or grasses. The fruit is like grain and in some varieties, like nuts.A bamboo forest in Kyoto, Japan**Grows 41 centimetres a day** The bamboo is the smart member of the grass family. And it grows really fast. If there is a road running through a bamboo grove, it may disappear completely in a month if it is not used. It grows at a rate of 41 centimetres a day and can rise up to 36 metres or the height of a ten-storey building!What is even more interesting about the bamboo is the number of uses it has for humans. Some make weapons like knives, bows and arrows out of it, while others eat it as a delicacy! Every part of it has a special use. In certain parts of south Asia and south east Asia, tender bamboo shoots make an important food item.**House of bamboo** The matured bamboo stems are used to build entire houses. While the circular bamboo stem is used for making posts, those split in halves are used to make the roof and floor planks. The hard outer layers are stripped off and used to make mats and lattices to separate rooms, and baskets to store stuff.**Bamboo buckets and knives** Some of the bamboos are so thick that if you cut them and scoop out the insides, you can use them as buckets. Smaller ones can be made into tumblers. As people in parts of south Asia and south east Asia do. Certain kinds of bamboo are so tough that they are used to make knives, bows and arrows.In Japan, gardeners use hollowed bamboo stems as water pipes and in China, the inner pulp is used to make paper. Its stem is used to make flutes in Java and in the United States, it is used as a fishing pole, walking stick and to make phonograph needles.A phonograph is an instrument used for reproducing sounds by means of the vibration of a needle following a spiral groove on a revolving disc or a cylinder.",

    "title": "Is New York Burning?",
    "article": "In New York, people consume about 500 million kilowatt hours of energy per square kilometre every year. This is almost half of the total amount of solar energy (heat of the sun rays) falling on such an area in a year. So New Yorkers, in effect, live under a sun-and-a-half.In addition, paved areas, walls and the roofs of buildings absorb and re-radiate more heat than soil or plant-covered ground. Water runs off these surfaces more rapidly, allowing little cooling by evaporation. And the heat is produced by the bodies of the people themselves and leaks out of every building.This interesting fact comes from the ‘Woodpecker volume 2000’, which carries interesting facts on the state of the planet and is brought out by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehradun, in north India. Creating environmentally sustainable technologies at the local level is its main concern.Aerial view of skyscrapers at night around Times Square, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.On a normal day, the air temperature in a city like New York is higher than its surrounding areas, says the Woodpecker volume. Scientists call these cities “urban heat islands.”If New York becomes this hot, it should have been burnt to a cinder long ago. What saves the city year after year from cooking itself to death?To find an answer to this, let us try and understand the way our body keeps itself cool.Our bodies are like hot electric irons, without an electric supply of course! Our bodies absorb heat from the sun and the environment. The process of digestion heats up the body further. And just like any other body, overheating can be dangerous.So what does our body do to counter this heat? We sweat. The evaporation of sweat, caused by the wind blowing over the surface of our skin, takes the heat away and cools our body down.The city of New York keeps itself cool by using the same phenomenon. What saves the city are strong winds. As the city becomes hot, the air also heats up substantially. Since hot air is lighter than cold air, it rises up, leaving behind a space with low air pressure.All it takes is a Force 6 wind once in a while to eliminate the heat island effect altogether.A Force 6 wind, according to the Beaufort Scale that measures wind velocity on a scale till 12, is a strong breeze that blows 40-50 kilometres per hour. When the wind moves over the seas, it get cooler and replaces the hot air of the city.In effect, these winds act as giant coolers that drive cold air of the seas to replace the hot air over the land. This makes the city cool and hence habitable.",

Have you ever wondered why the potato has roots on it?The potato is actually a stem. A stem in disguise, that grows under the ground!Many plants are masters at adapting themselves to their surroundings. They can change their structure to suit their needs.Farmer holding harvested dirty potatoes in his hands.Just as we keep large vessels handy in the scorching summer to store water, plants deal with the problem in a smarter way. Their body parts have changed over a period of time so as to adjust to their surroundings. Thus, the potato plant has changed the shape and size of its stem to store food and water. And this storage is done under the ground where it is relatively cooler.A typical plant’s body is made of three basic parts – root, stem and leaf. The root is generally hidden as it is under the ground. The stem is the tall, woody part, which gives support to the plant. The leaves are the green, flat and thin structures that manufacture food. However, all plants do not follow this pattern of division. In some, these parts of the plant’s body look very different from this description.This kind of adaptation can be seen everywhere in the plant and animal kingdom. Take the onion, for example. It is actually a leaf, which has been modified to store food and water.Similarly, the spines of a berry plant are actually its leaves. They have changed into this shape to protect it from plant-eating animals.Cactus: king of adaptationThe cactus is an expert at adapting itself to its surroundings. It grows in dry and arid regions where there is very little rainfall. So it has converted its leaves into spines to protect it from animals. Its stem fulfills the two vital functions of storing water as well as manufacturing food.The plant world is full of strange and wonderful adaptations. The next time you see potatoes in the vegetable market, you will know there is more to it than meets the eye. Literally!",

Because it is not sweet and is used for providing flavour to food, we think of it as a vegetable.The tomato is originally from Mexico. The word “tomato” comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatotl. Spanish explorers who went to South America about 500 years ago, brought back the tomato to Europe. The French called them love apples, while the British called them apples of gold. Young men made necklaces of tomato seeds and presented them to their loved ones.The tomato is originally from Mexico. The wordThe first people in Europe to eat tomatoes were Italians. As far back as 500 years ago, the joys of eating fried tomato with salt and pepper, was known to them. They discovered that tomato made a very good companion to pasta and cheese dishes.The Fruit which Became a VegetableIn other countries like England, tomatoes were thought to have poison in them. That is because tomatoes were related to poisonous plants called the belladonna. But people grew them in their gardens because of their attractive colour and look. They even thought that tomatoes caused fatal diseases. But they soon got over their fear of the trait.Is tomato a vegetable or a fruit?It is believed that the British brought the tomato to India.

    "article": "Unbelievable but true! A large West African monkey has simply vanished from the earth. It has joined the Dodo, by becoming the first primate to vanish in the 20th century. After a six-year long survey, scientists and wildlife experts have declared the monkey, known as Miss Waldron’s Red Colobus monkey, extinct.Primatologists (people who study the evolution of apes and monkeys) carried out exhaustive surveys in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, in Africa, but failed to spot a single monkey of the species. The last confirmed sighting of a Miss Waldron’s Red Colobus was over 20 years ago in Ghana’s rainforest. Soon after, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) declared the mammals endangered.Red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus kirki)The Miss Waldron’s Red Colobus was only discovered in 1933. There are five more varieties of the Red Colobus, all of which are rare and are found in Central and Western Africa. Kirk’s Red Colobus Monkey, first identified by Sir John Kirk, (British Resident to Zanzibar in the 1870s) is another animal that is severely endangered.The name ‘Colobus’ is derived from the Latin word for ‘maimed’. That is because Colobus monkeys either have very short thumbs or do not have thumbs at all. Their fur colour ranges from light orange to a fiery orange-red. They are small, about 70 cm at the shoulder, with long limbs and a tasseled tail.These monkeys are brachiates. They swing by their arms through the forest and feed in the upper layers of the forest at a height of about 150 feet.Colobus monkeys are quite timid and live in large, noisy groups. To prove their solidarity, these monkeys groom other members by removing parasites with their mouth. Funnily enough, this act of grooming takes place, more often, in the presence of monkeys from other groups.The monkeys are popular targets for poachers as the meat is considered a delicacy. Human encroachment and the reduction in natural forest habitat are other reasons for the decline of this monkey.Scientists estimate that 10 per cent of the world’s 608 primate species (and subspecies) are endangered. They feel that another 10 per cent may also be endangered unless strict measures are taken for their conservation.",

    "article": "Almost 400 years ago, Mughal emperor Jehangir acquired a new animal in his private collection or zoo – the zebra. This unusual, striped animal fascinated him so much that he wrote about it in his memoirs as a strange creature. Some even imagined that the animal’s stripes had been painted!The emperor decided to find out whether the zebra was indeed coloured or not. After much investigation, he made it public that the zebra, too, was a creature created by god. The stripes were natural, they had not been painted upon!All through history, kings and emperors have kept private collections of animals to please themselves and to increase their status. The first zoo of the kind that we are familiar with today, was built in 1759, from such an animal collection, near Vienna, Austria.The first zoo in India, too, probably came from the private collection of Raja Rajendra Mallick in 1854. The Marble Palace Zoo, as it was called, still exists in Calcutta.Not content with establishing the Marble Palace Zoo, Mallick helped found the Alipore Zoological Garden too, which housed birds and animals of different kinds and attracted people from far and wide, according to an article in a beautifully brought out information and activity manual, appropriately called ‘Wild at the Zoo’.Brought out by the Ahmedabad-based Centre for Environment Education, the imaginatively designed book is a storehouse of information that makes us look with new eyes at zoos and at the definition of ‘wild’ animals.Even though Mallick’s zoo came up in 1854, the Madras Zoo, founded in 1855, was perhaps the first zoo to come up in the face of pressure from visitors, according to ‘Wild at the Zoo’. And therein hangs a tale…It’s a Zoo Out There!Colonel Edward Balfour of the Government Central Museum in Madras (now Chennai) had a cheetah and tiger in the museum in 1854, who attracted great attention. The museum recorded a high number of visitors, which dropped once the animals were removed from the museum.Balfour was quick to see the connection and soon enough the Madras Zoo came into being. The zoo shifted to new premises in 1980.Today, there are over 300 zoos in India. They attract as many as 50 million visitors every year, according to the manual.After India attained independence, the first all-India meeting of the people who ran zoos was held in Madras Zoo. Among the issues discussed was the need to design zoos that would first and foremost suit the varied requirements of the animals housed in them. The need to breed endangered animals so they could be reintroduced in the wild and the equally urgent need to educate people about nature and wildlife were discussed as well.‘Wild at the Zoo’ lists out some of the well-known zoos in India: the National Zoological Park in New Delhi, Venkateswara Zoological park in Thirupati in Andhra Pradesh state, Indira Gandhi Zoological park in Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, the Nehru Zoological park in Hyderabad, Arignar Anna Zoological Park at Vandalur, Chennai and the Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Park in Mysore, Karnataka.",

    "article": "A sudden influx of jellyfish, in the Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic Ocean is worrying both scientists and fisher folk alike. The Gulf of Mexico is bordered on the north by the United States, on the east by Cuba, and on the south and west by Mexico.Jellyfishes are invertebrates (animals without a spinal column). Some are also venomous and their sting can cause paralysis. However, the Jellyfish that have the fishermen worried are not on a stinging spree. Instead, they are clogging propellers, ripping fishing nets and eating up the sea plankton.The animals are consuming microscopic plankton (the staple diet of fish in the region) and are now posing a serious threat to the Gulf’s ecological balance. The offshore oilrigs, artificial reefs and other man-made structures are providing ideal underwater breeding habitats for jellyfish.Water pollution is yet another reason being cited. The chemicals running into the Gulf of Mexico and from the Mississippi River, feed algae and other microscopic plankton. Jellyfish feed on plankton that in turn feeds on the nitrogen in the water.These animals have been known to live off the Caribbean Sea, but earlier this year, a few made their first appearance in the Gulf. It is believed that the jellyfish came through the Caribbean Sea on the hulls of ships. However, nothing prepared scientists for the sudden appearance of thousands of jellyfish.Jellyfish: Fragile creature of the seaJellyfish have been on earth for over 650 million years – much before dinosaurs and sharks. There are over 200 different species of jellyfish. They come in many shapes and sizes. The largest of them all, known as the Arctic lion’s mane, can reach eight feet across with tentacles that extend over half the length of a football field.A jellyfish has three main parts: the round umbrella-like body (called bell), which propels the animal with a pumping motion; tentacles that sting and immobilise prey; and oral arms (sometimes called flaps) that are used to catch and eat prey.Most jellyfish sting is too weak to hurt humans and only cause a mild irritation. However, there are exceptions like the Australian box jelly. Its toxin is more potent than cobra venom and can kill a person in minutes.Jellyfish are not really fish for they do not have gills. They breathe through their skin. Believe it or not, their bodies consist of more than 95 per cent water. If a jellyfish is placed on the beach, all that will remain, after a few hours, will be a puddle of water.Jellyfish are extremely fragile animals and tend to get stuck and tear easily. If you ever intend to keep a jellyfish as a pet, you’ll have to ensure the aquarium tanks is cylindrical with no corners.",

Astronomers seem to think it does.Last year, astronomers at the University of Arizona and a Massachusets Observatory discovered what looked like a new moon around Jupiter. They had been scanning the skies for comets and asteroids as part of a spacewatch programme. In fact, when they saw the new moon, they thought it might be a comet or an asteroid.A comet is a small body of ice and dust that orbits the Sun. When it approaches the Sun, the ice in it vaporises and forms a head and a tail. This object around Jupiter looked nothing like one, though it moved in an elongated orbit like a comet. It looked even less like an asteroid, which is a small rocky body that orbits the Sun. In the solar system, asteroids exist in a wide belt between Mars and Jupiter.Jupiter’s New MoonIf the new object was neither a comet nor an asteroid, what was it? The scientists were in a fix. They realised what it was only only last month when they observed its orbit.The orbit is the path that every object in the solar system takes while revolving around another object. And every object has a particular kind of orbit. Asteroids have one. Moons have another. Planets have yet another. It is possible to say what exactly an object in the solar system is by calculating the number of days it takes to go round its orbit. When the scientists made the orbital calculations of the new object, they realised it was not an asteroid, nor was it a comet. It was actually a new moon around Jupiter that had not been noticed before.But, the scientists are still not sure, and they will not be for a few more months. For, Jupiter and its moons are too close to the Sun right now. And, that is why the scientists have not assigned a permanent name for the moon. It is still known by the number it was allotted when it was first discovered — S/1999J.The new moon has a diameter of only 5 km, which means that the walk from one end of the moon to the other is only 5 km. It is Jupiter’s smallest moon. Actually, it is the smallest moon in the solar system.Before the new moon was found, the Jupiter’s smallest known moon was Leda, which is about 8 to 16 km. in diameter.This is not the first time that one of Jupiter’s moons is causing a stir. Some time ago, it was found out that one of its biggest moons, Io, actually does a lot of stirring and shaking. In the entire solar system, it is the only moon which is more volcanically active than earth.For all we know, the new moon may not be the last of Jupiter’s moons. There may be many others hiding out there, just waiting to be discovered.",

    "article": "How does a tree die? When it is cut down with an axe. But, sometimes, we may end up hurting or killing a tree without meaning to. It may happen when we carve our names or draw a heart on a tree trunk by cutting away the bark of the tree with a knife. For, along with the bark we also cut away an important tissue called phloem. This tissue carries the food made by the leaves to the other parts of the tree.If you cut a circle around the tree by removing the bark, you end up strangling the tree. The food supply to the trunk and the roots below stops. The roots die.When the roots die, the tree loses its supply of minerals and water that it collects from the soil. If the leaves do not get enough water, they lose the ability to make food. The tree suffers more and dies.Sometimes, farmers cut a circle around the tree knowingly. It is called ringbarking. They do it when they have to cut down that tree later.A dead tree in the desertBut it is not just humans who ringbark a tree. Even animals do it. Hungry rabbits nibble at smaller plants all the time and ringbark it. When deer rub their antlers against trees they do the same. And what about frisky cats who keep clawing plants? No wonder the best way to keep a plant alive and growing is to encircle it with a wire mesh.",

    "title": "King of Fruits – History of Mango!",
    "article": "It is a tree that is green at all times of the year. But it bears fruit in the height of summer. The hotter it is, the sweeter it becomes. And, it seems we humans cannot have enough of this juicy, fleshy fruit, for there are almost 1000 varieties of this king of fruits around the world to please our tongues and eyes.It could be round, almost like a ball, or it could be oval in shape, kidney shaped or just long and thin. It could have a red and yellow colour like the setting sun. Or it could be canary yellow or even leaf green. It could be small as a cricket ball or as big as a watermelon!Asia’s gift to the worldIf someone were to ask you about India or Asia’s great achievements, you can confidently say, Mango! Yes, the mango, in its original wild form, came from the forest of Assam in north-east India and Myanmar (Burma).Mango, in its original wild form, came from the forest of Assam in north-east India and MyanmarHow the mango got its nameIt’s an interesting story. The name mango comes from Tamil. From man-kay or man-gay, it changed to manga. The people who gave it the name manga or mango were the Portuguese. They first came to India, across the oceans, about 500 years ago. As they settled down in parts of India, they discovered the mango. They seemed to want more of it so they started experimenting with new varieties of mango — the famous Alphonso or Mulgoa that we cherish today, is the result of their hard work.And then they decided to introduce the fruit to the rest of the world.A fruit enjoyed since 3000 yearsImagine, while Indians have been talking excitedly about the fruit for 3000, yes 3000 years, the western world has savoured it for only 300 years!But how do we know that Indians have enjoyed the mango for 3000 years? Simple, they were excited enough to actually write about its good qualities in books. Not any other book, but the Upanishad — the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad. (Today we all know that the mango is rich in vitamin A, C and D) . It was mentioned by various names such as amra, chutha, rasala and sahakara.Down the ages, several qualities have got attached to the mango. It is seen as a symbol of good luck and in many parts of west and south India, mango leaves are put up at the front door. It is a belief that the mango tree has the power to make wishes come true. The mango tree is also associated with the god of love “Manmatha’; its blossoms are considered to be the god’s arrows. And it is said that the Buddha created a white mango tree which was later worshipped by his followers.Though the mango has become a household fruit, its wild cousins can still be found in the north-eastern part of India and Myanmar.",

    "article": "Do you believe that there might be life on other planets? Would you like to be the first ‘Earthling’ to make contact with an alien? Well, you can start your search from home. All you need is a computer and Internet access, and you can join the project of the US-based National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).NASA launched the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, eight years ago. Based at the University of California, SETI’s goal is to examine the radio signals coming from nearby stars. Researchers involved in the project believe that a large number of stars in the universe could have planets orbiting around them. And they want to know if these planets have conditions suitable to sustain life forms.How does the project work? There is a huge radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. It catches these radio signals, which are then fed into SETI computers. The telescope has a bowl-shaped dish which is 1000 feet in diameter. That makes it the world’s largest stationary radio telescope. The researchers have to analyse thousands of radio signals daily. They are looking for signals whose patterns would show the existence of hydrogen or water molecules that sustain life on Earth. They could be at it for years before showing a single positive result!Of course, even the researchers know that they cannot do a fast job on their own. So they are distributing the workload. And they want as many helpers as possible. Even you! If you want to join the search for extra-terrestrial life, then download SETI’s free software (SETI@home) from http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/.Large Array radio astronomy telescope dishesWhat happens next is fun. While you are away from your computer, the SETI programme downloads a small segment of the information on radio signals received by the radio telescope. It analyses the data and sends the result back to the University of California.There are other benefits too of having the SETI project software in your computer. When you leave your computer unattended, instead of seeing the usual screen saver, you can feast your eyes on a spectacular three-dimensional graph, flickering on the screen. This indicates that your computer is busy analysing SETI data and searching for signs of alien life!More than 1,824,500 people around the world are currently participating in the SETI@home programme and more are joining in every day. It’s a slim chance, but wouldn’t it be fantastic if your computer were to be the first to detect an alien signal!",

    "title": "Long Memory of Female Elephants is Responsible for the Well Being of their Families",
    "article": "You must have heard the phrase ‘elephant’s memory’ being used for people with a long memory.It seems the long memory of elephants, especially female elephants, is directly responsible for the well being of their families. This fact was discovered by a group of researchers of the University of Sussex who studied the elephants of Amboseli National Park in Kenya, the Telegraph newspaper reported.Elephants live in matriarchal families or families that are headed by the mothers. The oldest mother in the herd leads half a dozen other adult females and their children when they go looking for food. This is because the oldest female elephant is the one with the longest memory in the family. She can differentiate a friend from a foe more than anyone else.Long Memory of Female Elephants is Responsible for the Well Being of their FamiliesMales, on the other hand, do not form close bonds. They move out of their mothers’ herd in their teens. Then, they either live alone, or, in small bachelor groups.And since elephants live up to the ripe old age of 60, or more, it gives them enough experience to fall back on. The mother elephant uses her experience to identify the inviting calls from a particular herd and decide whether the family should respond to it.If it is a known voice, it is obviously a friend. If it is an unknown voice, she leads her family away. For, a stranger could also mean potential danger for the children in the herd.This way, the herd also saves time when it is finding matches for its females. It falls back upon the mother elephant’s knowledge about friendly herds in other places.The researchers found out that herds with leaders aged above 55 produced more calves per female than families with young leaders.This is why older elephants are very important for a herd’s survival. But, sadly, older elephants are always the first targets of hunters and poachers. Killing an old elephant not only upsets her family structure for years, but it also has an impact on the future of the herd.",

This way, their stretched muscles take the entire weight of the body.Their legs are so weak that they cannot even walk. When they want to walk, they drag their bodies on the ground.A hanging Flying Fox batThere was a time when bats could walk. But that was long long ago.Then they gradually began developing wing-like structures on their limbs which helped them fly.And now, after all these years of evolution, they have perfected the art of flying. They do it so well that they are, in fact, the only mammals in the world who can fly for long distances without a break.But with so much of flying, they have lost their ability to walk. Because they stopped using their limbs. When you don’t use a car for long, it begins to get rusted. And, after some time, you cannot use it anymore. Similarly, since the bats’ legs were not used, they lost their strength and could not support the bat’s body anymore.And, now they can only use their legs to hang upside down when they are sleeping.",

    "article": "Who is man’s best friend? Of course there are no points for guessing that one – the dog. The dog is the most popular domestic animal in the world. For more than 12,000 years the dog has been a companion, a protector and above all, an honest friend.But different civilisations and cultures have treated the dog in different ways. In some countries, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden, whereas in others they are even eaten as food. However, in most societies, dogs are protected and admired. Ancient Egyptians considered them sacred.Did you know that all dogs were wolves some 12,000 years ago? How is this possible you would ask?Some of the popular dog breedsThe dog storyDogs were the first animals to be domesticated. About 12,000 years ago, humans gave up hunting, gathering and nomadic lifestyle and settled in small settlements.These settlements attracted wolves and wild dogs, which would hang around the settlements to devour the leftovers. Humans in turn, began to rely on the dogs for warning of any approaching danger. Soon, humans found that not only were the dogs excellent hunting partners, but were equally reliable and intelligent.They then started domesticating and breeding (the process of controlled reproduction) those dogs which showed certain useful characteristics. This form of breeding is also called selective breeding.Paleontologists or scientists who study fossil remains, have found out that five distinct types of dogs existed by the beginning of the Bronze Age (about 4500 BC). They were the mastiffs, wolf-type dogs, sight hounds (such as the saluki or greyhound), pointing dogs, and herding dogs.Through the centuries many breeds were developed for specific tasks such as hunting, herding, or guarding. Today, however, most dogs are kept chiefly for companionship.Today there are approximately 400 different breeds of pure-bred dogs in the world. A pure-bred dog is considered to be one whose ancestry can be traced within the same breed for three generations.",

    "article": "What would happen if all the lions in Africa are carried away to some other place? The deer population will rise as there will not be anyone to kill them. With this population boom, the deer would need more food.After a point, there will no grass left to feed subsequent generations. This would lead to the destruction of the entire ecosystem which thrives and sustains itself on the grass. And the grasslands will turn into a desert.Similarly, if an organism were to reach a place where it finds suitable living conditions but no natural enemies, it would spoil that ecosystem as well. This is exactly what is happening.Marine Militants: Bio-Invasion through Cargo ShipsBio-InvasionShips carry huge loads of cargo which they transport from port to port. When these ships are not carrying cargo, they need something equal to the weight of cargo to move steadily on water. This is done by filling huge tanks called ballast tanks with water.When the ship has to take on the cargo, the ballast tanks are emptied. When these tanks are filled, huge number of marine organisms like bacteria, microbes, fishes, cysts, larvae and crabs get into the tanks.And when the water is pumped out in foreign waters, these organisms land in a new habitat where they flourish. But these new waters seldom have the traditional predators they face in their native areas.In USA, the European zebra mussle, a fresh water mollusc, has infested over 40 percent of internal waterways. In southern Australia, the Asian kelp, an algae, is invading new areas and have displaced native sea bed algae, reports the Down to Earth magazine.These organisms who go without any checks turn into militants, killing and encroaching upon the territory of native animals. This process is called bio-invasion.Efforts are now being made to curb such widespread mixing of population causing death and damage to local environments.",

    "article": "Guess what besides fat raindrops, rain clouds in Mumbai bring? Those tiny terrors, mosquitoes. Result: nights spent tossing and turning, and swatting the insects. But the next morning you wake up with those tell tale red marks on your arms, pause to think if you took a bath or not the previous night.That’s right. Human sweat turns mosquitoes on more than anything else. Research carried out by scientists in The Netherlands say that mosquitoes are actually quite finicky about whom they sting and never ever nibble at random. They find sweaty people absolutely irresistible however and the more stale the sweat the better. Yuck!Apparently the mosquitoes are attracted by a particular bacterium in human perspiration. However, scientists are yet to identify the bacteria. Once they manage to target the specific chemical, you can be sure they will find an antidote for it, that will help them create a mosquito repellent that works!But it’s not as if all mosquitoes are thirsty for human blood. Some prefer biting birds and nipping flower buds. Even among the species of mosquitoes that do bite us, only the female mosquitoes do the nibbling.Do you know why this is so? Well, they are looking for something called isoleucine (pronounced: iso-lu-seen)- an acid found in our blood. This acid helps female mosquito to lay eggs and she often ends up sucking up to four times her weight in blood.Mosquito MenaceSounds awful? Wait, there’s more. In the process of guzzling blood the female mosquito also injects us with her saliva. This saliva acts as an irritant and causes the bite to itch like crazy. Along with the saliva, many mosquito species also inject infectious microorganisms and transmit diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, and dengue.A female mosquito’s mouthpart is enlarged and well adapted for piercing the skin of mammals (like us) and sucking blood. Their male counterparts on the other hand do not have a complicated mouth structure and are perfectly happy sipping nectar and water.Among mosquitoes too, the female of the species is clearly deadlier than the male.There are approximately 2000 species of mosquitoes worldwide. These insects can be found everywhere- from the Arctic Circle to the Equator; from the lush tropical Amazonian forests to the icy Tundra. What this basically means is that there’s no escape from mosquitoes anywhere. Just pray there are more males than females in your neighbourhood.",

She does this through the sense of smell.More than one million animal species live on our planet and the females of the species recognise their young ones through smell, sound, sight or touch.Actually, most mammals recognise their young ones by smell. As soon as it gives birth, one of the first things a mare, ewe, doe or seal does is to smell the newborn. It becomes a mark of recognition. And, that is important for mammals, for, they take care of their young ones till such time as they are able to take care of themselves. Watch any movie about animals and you will see a cow or a mare sniffing at its calf or foal.Birds, however, are different. They recognise their infants through their voices. The mother makes a special ‘mother call’, which the baby takes note of as soon as it hatches out of an egg.A scientist called K. Lorenz once conducted an interesting experiment on geese. He removed the mother goose to another place just before the eggs hatched. Then he imitated a ‘mother call’. The result was that the goose lings followed him everywhere. They got a bit confused when they saw him standing, but they were absolutely comfortable with him as long as he stayed on his knees and crawled before them!",

Not with water though.When the housefly rubs its hands together, it is cleaning them. And, if you have the food it has cleaned itself on, you are in for a bad time. Nothing can save you from a bout of diarrhoea or dysentery after that.The whole body of the housefly, including claws and padded feet, is covered with sharp hairs. When it feeds on something, a part of it sticks to its hairs. And that needs to be cleaned. In the process of cleaning, it drops hundreds of germs that it has gathered while feeding on garbage or sewage. When it rubs its hands in glee, it is almost as if it were celebrating the completion of its mission — the mission of contaminating food.The fly has a unique way of eating. Although, it has a mouth, it cannot bite. Its mouth consists of a spongy pad. To feed, it releases saliva and digestive juices on the food, converting it into liquid. This liquid is then sucked up with the help of the sponge pad.Housefly sits on a table in the kitchenThe housefly has a dull, gray body with large, reddish, compound eyes. This tiny creature, lives and breeds in or near garbage. The female lays about 100 eggs at a time and as many as 1,000 eggs during her lifetime. The eggs hatch into larvae in 12 to 30 hours. Larvae are the wingless feeding form of insects when they hatch out of eggs.The larvae then shed their outer covering several times before becoming pupae. Within a few days, the pupae become adults and the cycle begins again. Most of the houseflies have a life span of about 30 days during summer. They live longer when the weather is cooler. But, they cannot stand very cold weather. The adults die in winter, while the larvae and pupae survive.",

    "article": "Are your ferns drooping more than usual? Perhaps a bit of music may perk it up, for it is a known fact that music plays an important role in plant growth. But plants are choosy about the kind of music they want to hear.Experiments show that plants thrive if soothing instrumental music is played in the background. On the other hand they shrivel and die if exposed to heavy metal or rock music. And now a Japanese company has created a gadget that puts you in touch with the ‘feelings’ of plants.This gadget gauges the electrical activity in plants and can register a plant’s response when exposed to music. The device is called the Plantone and has two sensor clips that are attached to the leaves of the plant.When the device’s lamp turns red, it means a strong electrical current has passed within the plant’s cells. It signifies a positive response. A green light on the other hand occurs when the cell electrical signals are weak, signifying a negative or unhappy response.So plants respond to music, but did you know that plants create music, too? Well, a biologist from England, Dr Linda Long, has discovered that the molecular structure of proteins found in plants can be used to create music. The question is how.All living matter contains proteins. Proteins are the basic building blocks of life and are essential for cell growth, muscular movement and transmission of hereditary characteristics.A vine that looks like a clef. Clef is a musical symbol used to indicate the pitch of written notes.Seven sequences for seven notesProteins are made up of a group of an organic compound called amino acids. These amino acids are nothing but combination of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur.Dr. Long grouped these combinations into seven sequences. Then she related the seven sequences with the seven musical notes – a note per sequence.After this she created a software which simply read the structure of a protein and converted it into the corresponding musical notes. They thought they would get random notes; instead the sequence formed a tune.Each protein in a plant has its own specific tune, which means that if an organism has 100 proteins, 100 musical compositions can be created. Dr Long, who plays the keyboard apart from studying plant proteins, has now turned artist.She has made a 25 minute CD called Music of Plants by putting together the tunes created by certain proteins found in the common coriander and mustard plant, among others.For her next musical project she intends to turn the proteins found in the human body into music. And considering the human body has an estimated 30,000 different proteins, she certainly has her work cut out!",

    "article": "Everywhere in Nature the small, weak and apparently helpless manage to survive by parasitism — sponging off hosts who may in their turn protect and help these hangers-on. Worms, ticks, fleas and various kinds of bacteria are common examples. But there are more spectacular cases among fish and other sea creatures.On riverbeds, a species of fresh water clam tosses her young at passing fish to attach themselves with hooks. The host carries them about, nourishing them until they are adult enough to let go, settle as the bottom, and start another lifecycle. This form of parasitism disperses the clams more widely.Many water creatures who benefit from spongers and hangers-on will go to great lengths to protect them. Deep down in the depths of oceans where light never penetrates, fish identify each other by emitting light. The Photoblehuron and the Anamalopa have space below their eyes for rearing bacteria which are luminous. Opaque screens protect the surrounding tissue from these organisms. If these fish are threatened by larger ones and want to “disappear” they can switch off their light! The microbes in their turn get good from the fish from supplies of oxygenated blood.Indeed, the manner in which some sea creatures take help from each other makes them seem like mutual aid societies. Shrimps maintain “cleaning stations” on some coral reefs. They wave their feelers at huger creatures swimming past who would otherwise gobble them. These bigger fish suffer from itchy skin, festering wounds, dead tissue or parasites. So they are happy to let the shrimps nibble it all away. In the process the cleaners earn themselves a meal.Cleaner-fish render the same service. They work steadily and swiftly, going over their customers quite thoroughly. One cleaner-fish was observed servicing 300 customers in six hours! When experimenters removed all the cleaner fish, their clients moved off to other reefs where “service stations” were available.These larger hosts are often very protective of the cleaners. If a small goby is busy cleaning the teeth of a giant grouper and it sees danger approaching, the grouper partially closes its mouth to hide the goby. Or if the goby is cleaning its grills it will compress them until the predator fish has passed. All large fish who need servicing present themselves to the cleaners, remaining still in the water and opening their mouths wide just as we do in a dentist’s chair.The remora or sucker-fish is a life-long sponger. It has a modified dorsal fin to attach itself to giant sharks and turtles. When its host makes a kill it detaches itself only long enough to snap up morsels of food floating about. It gets free board, lodging, and free passage to travel long distances in the sea without exerting itself. In return for these benefits it cleans its host every now and then, giving the larger fish a thorough treatment.Sea anemones are creatures of prey, their colourful tentacles spread wide to capture passing creatures. But clown fish flick about among their deadly petals without harm. Anemones leave these guests alone, however, since they nibble off dead or diseased tentacles to keep these lethal blooms in good health. But if an anemone should turn nasty and sting a clown fish it wouldn’t have any effect. The clown fish has a special mucous coating to protect it from being poisoned.",

I crawled under a leaf of the plant. With my head hanging down, I spun a pad of silk and soon fastened myself to the pad.Ah! Look! It was a yellow orange bag that I spun. A warm, cosy and beautiful bag. My mother told me that I was a pupa and must rest at this stage.The very next day the yellow-orange bag turned into a shining silvery one with black trimming. This was my silver cascade.It was the eighth day of my pupal stage. My silver cascade took a blue tinge. Then, it all happened very soon.The silver cascade turned bluish blackAt first, two little feet came out of the cascade. Then two more……and finally two more.Finally, it’s me with six feet and four wings like my mother.My wings looked wet and crumpled. I rested for a while. Then I began to fan my wings up and down. Soon my wings became large and beautiful.Now, I am a full grown butterfly kid. Fluttering my wings, I fly happily saying good bye.I am full grown.First published by National Book Trust, India",

    "title": "Paris is Bugged by Termites!",
    "article": "Recently Parisians have been facing quite a bit of trouble; bookshop owners live in mortal terror of their precious books disintegrating, while owners of wooden houses are constantly worrying that their homes might collapse into a pile of rubble.Strangely enough, the cause of all this problem is really teeny. In fact the culprit that has most of Paris, France, upset is able to squeeze through an opening as small as 1/32 of an inch! Not so terrifying after all, but then these creatures live in gigantic colonies – consisting of more than a million members and love munching on wood and paper.Yes, these havoc-causing critters are the common termites. It is estimated that these bugs have now conquered two thirds of the city and the number of termite-infested houses is put at between 1,500 and 2,000. Besides, many of the city’s trees, wooden buildings, and in particular bookshops, are at great risk.Termites have been around for over 250 million years and although they look similar to ants, these insects are more closely related to cockroaches. Unlike the common cockroach, termites lead more complicated lives and have an extended social set-up earning them the nickname, “social cockroaches.”Termites live in colonies or termitaries. These range in size from several hundred to several million individual members. A single colony consists of workers, soldiers and the reproductives (the termites that breed, of which the King and the Queen are the most important).The workers build the nest and provide food for all colony members. The soldiers protect the colony, while the King and Queen ensure a constant supply of eggs.In many species, egg production may approach 30,000 eggs per day. Termite Queens live up to 15-25 years and are capable of laying an egg every 15 seconds! Both the king and the queen are longer-lived than other termites, and the queens are larger than other members of their colony.In certain tropical species, the queen grows to an enormous size, sometimes as much as 20,000 times the size of the worker.Paris is bugged by termites!Worker termites are small, creamy white insects and these are the termites that nibble pages and bore through wood. Incredible as this may sound worker termites never sleep and work 24 hours a day.Phew! Of the 2000 known species of termites, most are distributed in tropical countries and all have soldiers with greatly enlarged heads. The soldiers of certain species have with huge jaws for defence of the colony while in some species, the soldiers have long snouts, from which they eject a poisonous substance to kill enemies.The reproductives are dark-colored males and females with fully developed wings. At maturity, they leave the parental nest to mate. A new colony is established by the male and female who then become the king and queen of that particular colony.The common termites, found in households and buildings, build nests on the ground and construct mud tubes along foundation walls in order to attack nearby objects. These insects can enter buildings through cracks, microscopic gaps between brick and through pipes.So if you have not termite-proofed your wood, look out for mud or sand lining your doors or walls and prepare yourself for an invasion of paper snatchers for termites can destroy all paper and riddle your woodwork until it looks like a sieve.",

    "article": "Many people living in Andhra Pradesh may have escaped the wrath of the cyclone that ravaged the state last month, but the migratory pelicans, in a small costal village in northern Andhra, weren’t quite as fortunate.The storms’ heavy winds and rains didn’t cause as much material damage as was expected, however it proved disastrous for the pelicans as small chicks were blown out of their nests.About 75 fledglings are believed to have perished in the storm and forest department officials were able to rescue only 22 baby pelicans. Environmentalists estimate that about 75 to 100 migratory pelicans from Siberia were nesting in the village (Telikunchi).Every year, during the bitter winter season, hundreds of migratory birds, such as painted storks and pelicans, leave icy Siberia and head towards Andhra Pradesh to lay their eggs.Pelicans are classified under the order Pelecaniformes. The large seabirds, albatrosses, also belong to this order. Albatrosses are nomadic birds that spend months wandering great distances over the oceans. They sleep while floating on the ocean surface, drink seawater, and feed on small marine animals; and return to land only to breed!Three Brown Pelicans fly out to seaAlbatrosses are quite fearless and often follow a ship for days, swooping down to gobble up any tidbit thrown from the ship. There is a prevalent superstition, among the sailing folk, that killing an albatross brings bad luck.The wandering albatross found throughout the southern hemisphere, is one of the largest flying birds in the world. It has a wingspan of 3.4 metres and weighs about 13.5 kg.The white pelican of Canada, is relatively smaller, but is still considered one of the larger birds since it has a wingspan of 2.7 metres. Pelicans eat small fish and shrimp and while some species dive into water (like kingfishers) others float on water and snatch up fishes swimming in shallow waters.Pelicans have short legs, a long flattened bill, and a distinctive flap of skin below the bill, (near the throat) which is used to capture and store fish. They then bring out the food later, either for their own meal or to feed their chicks.Although pelicans appear large and ungainly, they are actually strong fliers and some species (like the kind that visit India from Siberia) undertake long migratory flights, staying the winter in coastal areas and heading back home during the summer months.",

    "article": "Oil spills can have a devastating effect on marine life. After an oil spill, one of the most important jobs of rescuers is to fish out oil soaked birds and animals, clean them and rehabilitate them before releasing them into the wild again.Recently, after an oil spill in the Australian waters, environmentalists claimed that the oil slicks were threatening the existence of the little blue penguins in the south of Australia.These tiny, blue-backed penguins are barely 41 centimetres in height – half the height of the world’s biggest, and famous Emperor penguins of Antarctica.A penguin has shiny feathers that are coated in natural oils which make it waterproof and keep the bird warm in the icy waters. Crude oil from a spill destroys these natural oils and the bird fails to protect itself from the cold. And, since it preens its feathers using its beak, it is liable to swallow poisonous oil and die.During rescue operations, after a minor spill, officials at the Phillip Island National Park (South of Australia) hit upon a unique method to keep the penguins warm and prevent them from swallowing the deadly oil.And, all it took were a few knitting needles and yarn. Yes, the rescuers actually dressed up the rescued penguins in tiny sweaters, such that only their heads and flippers stuck out.The designs of these special penguin sweaters were uploaded on the net and countless people from different parts of the world sent sweaters for these tiny birds.Of course, if you visit Phillip Island, you are not likely to see penguins waddling around in sweaters. This clothing is used only when a penguin has just been rescued from an oil slick. Once the penguins are cleaned and dressed in the sweaters, they are put in salt-water pools for rehabilitation.As they swim around and regain their strength, the salt water gradually destroys the wool. By the time, the penguins are ready to return to the ocean, their natural oils are restored and they go home dressed only in their feathers.",

It can also kill the mosquito larvae (Larvae are the wingless forms that hatch out of insect eggs). The best news of all is that it is very effective against the Anopheles mosquito, which spreads malaria.Peppermint to Chase Mosquitoes AwayThe scientists did an interesting experiment. They first took out oil from the peppermint plant called Mentha piperita. Then they poured some of that oil on top of water that contained mosquito larvae. The next day they found that the larvae had been killed.Several people decided to test the ability of the oil to chase away mosquitoes. They rubbed the oil on their bodies and slept out in the open. Eight out of 10 people said they did not have mosquitoes biting them.",

    "article": "Astronomers working at Berkeley and Geneva have found nine new planets circling nearby stars. With this discovery, we now know of 50 extra-solar planets, also called exoplanets. That is a big increase from 41 planets last known five years ago.All these individual planets move in an orbit around a star, which is called their parent star. The astronomers estimate that the Beta Pictoris star has a planet ten times the mass of Earth. It orbits at a distance of about 10.5 billion kilometers, more than ten times the distance of the earth from the sun. And Vega, one of the brightest stars in the sky appears to have a planet twice the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. This planet is 8 billion kilometers from its parent star. In comparison, our solar system seems almost tiny. The distance between Pluto, the farthest planet in our solar system and the sun is “just” 5.9 billion kilometers!Besides these two planets, there are two others, which are as big as Saturn. These two orbit very close to their parent star. What is surprising is that one of them takes just 2.98 days to complete a round and the other takes 29.8 days. Now the astronomers have to put on their thinking caps to figure out why one circles the star exactly ten times faster than the other!Stars, planets and galaxy in a free space. ‘Elements of this image furnished by NASA’.Since many extra solar planets are too far away to see directly, astronomers must detect extrasolar planets by carefully watching the stars to see if they “wobble,” or slightly shift their center of mass. Just as the moon has gravitational effects on Earth, and each of the solar system planets has a slight effect on our sun, any large object orbiting a star will tug at the star, causing the star to move slightly.When searching for extrasolar planets, astronomers see a slight shift in a star’s light as an alert that some object — perhaps a planet — may be orbiting it. Several of these stars now seem to show unexplained wobble behaviour, a condition that many scientists think is evidence for second and even third planets orbiting them, according to a report in The Hindu.Geoff Marcy of San Francisco State University told the BBC: “The planets we are finding around other stars, all orbit in elongated, elliptical orbits. It’s quite frightening that virtually all planets that we have found orbit close to their stars where they heat up and then move out to where they cool down,” as reported in Deccan Chronicle.In such a case, water, if it did exist on these planets, would boil and then freeze! In such a situation, would life — as we know it — exist on these planets?",

    "title": "Pollution – an old ancestral legacy",
    "article": "If you thought today’s pollution and environmental damage was just as old as the coming of industrial factories, smoke and chemical waste, you were wrong. A recent report in the journal ‘Science’ says that environmental pollution is as old as human existence itself, though industrialisation certainly hastened the process.The report is based on a study consisting of the combined research of 19 scientists across four continents, who found that the diversity of marine life was among the first to be affected. Entire species of animals were killed. This created an imbalance in the ecological chain as certain species decreased rapidly while some other species increased their numbers.The list of hunted sea creatures as far back as 10,000 years ago, is impressive: sea turtles in the Caribbean, sea cows off the Australian coast, and sea otters near Alaska. Since the sea animals came ashore regularly to lay eggs, they were an easy catch.Pollution – an old ancestral legacyWhile there’s no getting away from the fact that “modern” forms of waste and pollution have led to much higher levels of environmental degradation, today’s generation can take heart from the fact that they are only following in their ancestors’ footsteps – and learning to be a step ahead of them!The extent to which we have overtaken our predecessors becomes evident from these alarming facts:Over India, dust particles are found at a height of over 20,000 feet above the ground.In the bodies of Indians, DDT is present in almost twice the quantities present in those of Americans, which in turn is twice the level found in those of the British.Lead is present in the Pacific Ocean as well as in the air above it, in amounts many times the pre-industrial level.It is impossible to take a 50-gallon sample of water from the sea anywhere in the world without finding measurable amounts of man-made radioactivity.",

    "title": "Rhinoceros: On the Comeback Trail",
    "article": "Next to the tusk-bearing elephants, rhinos are the other large animals heavily targeted by poachers. Rhinos are poached for their horns and these are sold in the black market at astonishing prices.Since 1977, trade in rhino horn has been banned but poachers and smugglers still hunt and kill these gentle creatures to meet the demands of the rhino horn in markets in Central Asia and the Far East.For some years now, rhinos have been high on the endangered list. Thankfully, things are looking a lot brighter both for the African white, and for the greater one-horned Asian rhino (more commonly known as the Indian rhino).Rhinoceros: On the Comeback TrailThe white rhino population in Africa has recovered a little over the last twenty years due the rigorous policing by game wardens at the Kruger National Park in South Africa. To deter poachers, game wardens sometimes cut off the horns so that these animals are not unnecessarily killed.According to latest statistics, the Indian rhino species too is making a steady comeback and conversationalists say that Kaziranga National Park in Assam, now houses some 1,600 one-horned rhinos – making it one of the world’s largest rhino reserves.In the past, poachers have operated in isolated parts of the reserve (between 1980 and 1995, about 600 Indian rhinos were killed), but tight security has now overcome this menace. But Kaziranga faces a dire shortage of rangers and wardens to cover the entire sanctuary – only 150 rangers to cover 430 square kilometres of area.Though the odds are heavily in favour of the poachers, villagers living on the periphery of the sanctuary are now being recruited as guards, giving a much needed boost to security. Apparently this arrangement is working out and in the past few months there has been no untoward incident in the sanctuary.The value of rhino horns have increased a thousand fold as people are willing to pay astronomical sums for these horns. Smugglers pay local poachers anything from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000 (1 dollar = Rs 46 in current prices) for a horn and sell it in the international markets at a whopping Rs. 1.5 million per kilogram! (Considering at an average, a full-grown rhino horn weighs about two to three kilograms, the stakes are extremely high).The horn is in great demand in East Asia and China as it is believed that the horns have medicinal value while sometimes the poached horn is used to make handles of daggers.China is the main producer of medicines containing rhino horn with factories illegally using about 650 kilos of horn a year. A rhino horn is believed to cure a wide range of illnesses from skin diseases to heart trouble and is even considered an aphrodisiac, but scientists and doctors scoff at the idea and say that there is no proof that rhino horn is indeed beneficial.Although the rhinoceros family was once widespread today only five species exist: three in Asia and two in Africa.",

    "article": "Have you ever caught a glimpse of a cockroach scurrying across your kitchen floor? Well, by the time you manage to get your hands on a roach repellent, the cockroach would have disappeared. Not surprising really, considering you are dealing with one of the greatest escape artists in the insect kingdom.Yes, cockroaches or roaches for short, are adept at wriggling out of tight spots. Whether it is a frog lurking behind a bush, or a descending broom, these creatures have an uncanny ability to scent danger. That’s how they have survived on earth for the past 320 million years!There are about 3,500 known species of roaches found worldwide, yes, even in the North and South poles. Of these, only 30 species have an inclination to live with people. These include the American, German, Oriental, brown-banded, and Madeira cockroaches.Cockroach scurrying acrossBut how do they sense danger? Is it with their antennae or is it something like a sixth sense? A recent study carried out by American scientists shows that roaches use something more tangible to detect danger – their hair. According to scientists, tiny hairs on a roach’s back act as sensors and are designed to bend easily. These hairs are oriented in all possible directions and can sense changes in wind movement – from all sides.Cockroaches are very, very sensitive to minute changes in air movements. Subtle shifts in wind patterns bend the hair in a particular direction. This signal is sent to the nerve cells. The cells process the information and guide the cockroach to take evasive action. All this takes place almost instantaneously.The cockroach differentiates between regular wind patterns and the kind of slow-moving air that signals the approach of an attacker. Normal wind flow creates mixed-up swirl patterns. However, the movement of a foot, (or the approach of a frog) generates a smoother, slower wind pattern.For example, the moment you take aim with a shoe from behind a roach, the insect senses a slight change in the wind pattern from behind, as the hair on its back is pushed forward. It immediately darts off in the opposite direction.However, vacuum cleaners have even smart roaches fooled. Vacuum cleaners suck in air, so when the vacuum nozzle is pointed at the back of a cockroach, the air blows from the roach’s head towards its back and into the nozzle – causing the hair to get pushed backwards. The roach thinks that the wind is blowing from the front (towards it) since the hair sensors are being pushed backwards and quickly turns around and runs straight into the nozzle!Most roaches are sensitive to light and try to hide. However, certain Asian species and the American cockroach are attracted to light. Roaches may be winged or wingless, but not all winged species fly.Cockroaches can live without food for a month, but can only survive a week without water. As such, a cockroach can live a whole week without its head! Without a mouth the roach can’t take in water and finally dies of thirst.Cockroaches can eat anything, including other cockroaches. They play an important role in the decomposition of forest litter and excreta. But because they breed rapidly, soil things, and are potential disease carriers, cockroaches are the most misunderstood creatures in the insect kingdom.So even as they continue to be targeted by shoes, brooms or vaccum cleaners, chances are that they will, finally, outlast humans. Their record proves it: they have been around a whole lot longer than us!",

But, have you seen, or even heard of jute roads?A research centre in Calcutta, the National Institute of Research on Jute and Allied Fibre Technology (NIRJAFT), is planning to make a road with jute. It will be 24 kilometres long.The scientists at the centre say the road will be stronger than normal roads. They can talk with such confidence because they have tried it out earlier. And, the road they made was indeed stronger. It did not develop holes after the monsoons got over.Most of the roads in the country need repairs after the rains. They actually look like they have broken bones after the beating they receive at the hands of the monsoons.NIRJAFT made a road in a village called Guptipara, which is about 100 kilometres from Calcutta. When they were making the road, they used a thin layer of jute between the gravel, or small stones used in making roads, and the soil. This ensured that the rainwater, which collected by the roadside, was drained much faster than usual. As a result, the road lasted much longer.The scientists say the thin layer of jute also helps keep the gravel in place. This was reported in the The Times of India recently.The report mentioned a scientist as saying that by using jute, a road’s life can be increased by three to four years.The research centre is planning to make wide rolls of jute, which will be used to make these roads. And, eventually when it does degenerate, it will become a part of the soil. For jute is biodegradable.",

It described a mechanical device that looked human but lacked emotions. It worked mechanically.Modern-day robots do not necessarily look like humans. But they are programmed to handle tasks that are normally carried out by humans, especially in big factories that manufacture products like cars. Employers prefer these mechanical devices because of many reasons: they are faster and more accurate than human workers; they never ask for a pay hike; nor do they take endless coffee breaks! Robots are also capable of working in an environment that is dangerous for humans.Robots on the factory floor, building a carThey can be found in many places — sorting out bolts in factories, digging a mineshaft, collecting soil samples on the planet Mars, and photographing the ocean floor. Now robots are all set to take over the hospital floor too. No, not as doctors, but as couriers.Usually, big hospitals have attendants scurrying around to deliver medicines and bottles to different wards. Researchers at the University of Arkansas in the United States say that the mobile robots they have created, are ideal for the job of hospital attendants. They insist that their robotic couriers will save the hospitals millions of dollars in the long run.These mobile robots, known as HelpMates, store a detailed map of the hospital in their memory. They are mobile and are programmed to avoid obstacles and people. The robots’ sensors can detect a human’s approach and quickly get out of the way. Unlike humans, these robots cannot navigate staircases. But, yes, they know how to press a button for the elevator. They travel up the floors in style!Researchers at a Massachusetts university have gone a step further. They are creating a robot that can constantly change its shape according to the task it has to do. These robots are called polymorphic robots. Polymorphic means the ability to take different forms.How does the robot change its form any number of times? There is a 3D printer placed inside the robot. This printer uses a nozzle to build up layers of thermoplastic to create the desired shape. Thermoplastic is a kind of plastic that softens upon heating and hardens when cooled.The entire process of changing form in this manner is called the rapid prototyping technology. It is fairly common in the car industry and is used to produce complex three-dimensional structures quickly.Once the robot has performed its task, it can be melted down. Its thermoplastic parts can then be recycled into another useful gadget by the 3D printer&mldr; The polymorphic robot is a classic case of form according to function.",

    "article": "Would you believe it? The soft sand that we sink into on the beach is actually rock? Sand is what a rock becomes after years of being worn down by rivers. Years of sea waves crashing against huge rocks and cliffs makes rocks break into small particles. And ultimately, they end up as sand. The colours of sands — yellow, red, grey, black — depend on the kind of rock it comes from. Sometimes desert sand is carried by winds across great distances, to seasides, increasing the amount of sand in the sea.Cracked lava rocks from Mauna Loa volcano, one of five volcanoes that form the Island of Hawaii. It is the largest active volcano on Earth.The earth has more than 600 active volcanoes. Many of them are to be found on what is called the ‘Ring of Fire’ on land and under water around the Pacific Ocean. The largest active volcano on the Earth today is the Mauna Loa, which is about 4168 metres (13,677 feet) high. It is on the Hawaiian islands. One volcanic explosion in Mauna Loa lasted for more than a year. Among the other volcanic areas in the world are Indonesia and Iceland. While the former has more than 600 of them, the latter boasts of having about 200 volcanoes. Many people have died due to volcanic eruptions. It is believed that the ancient city of Pompeii was destroyed completely because of a volcanic eruption. If volcanoes are so destructive, why do people live near them, one might ask. That’s because the ash that covers the land after a volcanic explosion makes the land very fertile. So people are prepared to take the risk.Earthquakes, too, can happen on land or under the seas. Most of the earthquakes also occur in the area known as the “ring of fire” that encircles the Pacific Ocean. Turkey, which had a terrible earthquake last year, falls in this earthquake prone area. A large part of the Himalayan region, too, falls in the earthquake zone. Two major earthquakes in the 1990s prove this fact. However, it is not as if we get to know about all earthquakes. Many vibrations of the Earth’s crust are so tiny that they escape our notice. We only get to know about the large earthquakes. It is said that almost a million earthquakes occur in one year. Of these, a large earthquake occurs every two weeks under the sea.One-tenth of the Earth’s surface is always under the cover of ice. And almost 90 per cent of that ice is to be found in the continent of Antarctica. The remaining 10 per cent is found on the mountains in the form of glaciers. Imagine, the ice sheet that covers Antarctica is almost one-and-a-half times the size of America. And the only creatures that live on Antarctica all year round, are insects.Antarctica, too, has one active volcano. It is called Mt. Erebus and it emits steam and gives out ash even though it is in a snowy region.",

But, as the momentum of activity increases, officials of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) start feeling queasy in their stomachs. For, though festivals like Ganesh Puja and Durga Puja are a time for fun, it is also the time when rivers and lakes around the country are abused.Unlike in the past when the idols of gods and goddesses were made of ordinary colours and plain clay that dissolve in water easily, without causing widespread pollution, now they are made of plaster of Paris, distemper, plastic paint, dyes, metallic powders, adhesives, varnish, fluorescent powders and oil paints, which can have an adverse effect on the eyes, skin and respiratory system. These coloured idols with pigments containing harmful chemicals, flowers, coconut shells, plastic bags, wood and other items find their way into the waters.People use crane to lift Lord Ganesha idol for the traditional immersion during Hindu festival ganesh chathurthi (Hyderabad, India) reddees / Shutterstock.comNot only do they pollute the rivers, they slowly push these water bodies towards an imminent death. While these items are harmful to life in the rivers and lakes, the insoluble plaster of Paris chokes natural water sources like lakes and wells. It causes an excessive amount of silting, which reduces the depth of the lake/river and affects its water-retaining capacity.Be it the Hussain Sagar lake in Hyderabad, the Ganga or our own Yamuna, they are all victims of unthinking practices by humans. While the Hussain Sagar has become so polluted that migrating birds have stopped visiting it during the winter months, the Ganga in Calcutta literally chokes after every Durga Puja. And the Yamuna has become so contaminated that it can barely support marine life.No wonder the Centra Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials are worried. But it is not as if nothing is being done about the problem. This year (2001), civic authorities and festival organisers in Mumbai and Pune tried to ensure that the Ganesha idols were not immersed in water and dug pits for offerings to be deposited.Perhaps the rest of India should take similar initiatives, the CPCB officials feel. And, maybe, the gods too will help in the attempt&mldr;",

    "article": "When you go swimming in the river, you are told to be careful about the rocks, as you may bruise yourself if you hit against them.But, fish swim in the water all the time. Through cracks and crevices in rocks inside the water, and between the branches of thorny water plants. They do not get bruised so easily.And its not because their parents had given them sound advice. They don’t have to. They know the little fish are safe.Very visible scales of a fresh carp fishFish have tough scales on their bodies which serve as a protective layer and guard them against predators and a harsh environment.The toughness of the scales depends on the lifestyle of the fish and its home. That is why the scales of fishes who live near the coast or in reefs are always stronger than those of fishes living in deeper waters, where they do not encounter too many ragged surfaces.For instance, the scales of the Coelacanth fish are so rough and tough that people living in the Comoro Islands use it as a substitute for sandpaper.Fish scales are also covered with mucus that makes the skin slippery and gives extra protection. The mucus is produced by special cells under the scales.",

    "title": "Scientists Find More on the Eureka Man",
    "article": "Why do ships float on water when in fact they should sink? Why does paper float on water and a paperweight sink? The answer to these questions was accidentally discovered 2200 years ago by the Greek inventor and mathematician, Archimedes.One day, while getting into his bath he noticed water spilling over the sides. In a flash, Archimedes realised the relation between the water that had fallen out and the weight of his body – in other words he discovered why some objects float and some sink! Archimedes was so excited with his discovery that he hopped out of the bath, and rushed naked into the street yelling triumphantly, ‘Eureka!’ ‘Eureka!’ (Greek word for ‘I have found it!).Archimedes Principle – EurekaArchimedes discovery, now popular as the Archimedes’ principle, explains why steel ships, weighing thousands of tons, float. But what is Archimedes’ principle? When a body is immersed in water, it experiences a force (known as the buoyancy force).This force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the body. For instance, a lump of steel will sink for it is unable to displace water that equals its weight. But steel of the same weight but shaped as a bowl, will float. This is because the weight gets distributed over a larger area and the steel displaces water equal to its weight. So a heavily laden ship floats because its total weight is exactly equal to the weight of the water it displaces. It is this weight that exerts the buoyant force supporting the ship.Archimedes is also known for his extensive work in geometry; and the invention of the lever and pulley. He also created a range of mechanical devices for the defense of his homeland – the catapult and a mirror system (for focusing the sun’s rays on an enemy’s boat causing it to catch fire).In a rare find, scientists have recently managed to unearth a manuscript, the only surviving copy that contains Archimedes’ theory of flotation and some mechanical theorems. Particularly interesting is the fact that in many parts of the manuscript, Archimedes gives detailed explanations using diagrams. Researchers now hope to get a valuable insight into how Archimedes’ mind worked and how he went about devising his abstract theorems.According to historians, Archimedes probably wrote his manuscript on papyrus scrolls, fragile in nature. About a 1,000 years later, the documents were copied onto leather sheets and bound into a book form, to prevent their deterioration.In the Middle Ages about 1000 years ago, in Europe, Christian monks frequently recycled parchment works. The contents of the parchment held little interest for the monks, but they needed writing materials, so they tore apart the original manuscript.The writing was erased by scraping the skin and the pages were cut in half and recycled into a Christian book of religious instructions. The new words were written sideways across the original text. Such works became known as ‘palimpsests’ (Greek for ‘scraped again’). The manuscript that is currently under study at a university in New York is called the Archimedes Palimpsest.For 700 years, it remained in Palestine and Constantinople, cities that were once centers of learning. In 1906 a Danish scholar discovered the barely legible original text underneath. The book disappeared again around 1920 only to surface in an auction house as recently as 1998.Now scientists are piecing together the cut pages and are using ultraviolet and infrared filters to capture images of the original words. Both infrared and ultraviolet light penetrate the surface text and get reflected. The reflected text is recorded on camera and reveals details that aren’t evident to the naked eye. The job is quite complicated, but scientists hope to decipher the writing soon.",

    "title": "Sea Turtles",
    "article": "Can you name an animal that returns to the place of its birth, every single year, journeying more than 1,000 km to do so? Well, here is another hint: this animal is a sea creature that originated on earth more than 200 million years ago- making the species older than the oldest ever dinosaur.Give up? They are none other than marine turtles, more commonly known as sea turtles. Seven existing species of sea turtles exist in the world today of which at least four (the Olive Ridley, Green Hawksbill, Leatherback and Flatback) are fairly common in the waters of the Indian Ocean. The sea turtle, or the Leatherback is the largest living turtle. It can grow up to a length of six feet and is known to weigh about 700 kgs!The leatherback sea turtle, sometimes called the lute turtle, is the largest of all living turtles and is the fourth largest reptileSea turtles live mostly in warm waters around the world and are graceful swimmers, with limbs modified into long flippers that enable them to migrate long distances. Among the many natural phenomena that we are yet to understand, is the mass nesting by sea turtles, known as ‘arribada’.The word ‘arribada’ is derived from the Spanish word ‘arribadas’ which means ‘arrival’. There are four such mass nesting sites (or arribada sites) in the world- two in Costa Rica, one in Mexico and the largest in Gahirmatha beach on the Orissa coast.Each year, from December to April, Gahirmatha plays host to hundreds and thousands of female Olive Ridley turtles. These turtles lay their eggs on the same beach where they were born. Turtles always return to the same nesting site year after year, even if they migrate thousands of kilometres. This particular phenomenon has baffled scientists for years now and no one has any clue as to why they do so.Sea turtles rarely venture out of the deep and they never seem to have a permanent habitat for they are continuously on the move. Unlike the male Olive Ridleys who prefer the anonymity (and safety) of the sea, female Olive Ridleys brave predators as they drag themselves to the shore to lay their eggs. Each year more than one lakh Olive Ridley turtles lay about 100 eggs each in the sands of Gahirmatha beach.Mama turtle lays her eggs in pits and covers them with sand using her flippers. However the slightest disturbance can result in mama turtle returning to the sea without laying eggs. Her task complete, she heads off to the sea, only to return next year to the very same beach, again during the nesting season.Meanwhile the eggs are easy targets for predators. Stray dogs often manage to ferret out the catch and gobble up the eggs. Those that aren’t eaten hatch after 50-70 days and the teeny baby Olive Ridleys immediately begin moving towards the sea. How do they do that?Researchers and biologists say that the hatchlings are attracted by the bright horizon or the moonlight sparkling on the water. Recent studies show that the glow of neon lights and brightly lit buildings has been misleading the babies, making them lose their bearings.In the last few years, the number of turtles nesting at Gahirmatha (and the smaller adjoining beaches) has reduced. Environmentalists point out that the indiscriminate fishing by local villagers results in turtles getting entangled in the huge nets and few fisherfolk release the animal back safely. Instead, they kill it and toss the carcass into the water.Protests by wildlife activists forced the government to take action and in the year 1998, Gahirmatha became a protected wildlife sanctuary with the coast guard and the forest department monitoring the coastal waters.",

    "title": "Seasons in a Tree’s Rooted Life",
    "article": "You may be very proud of the fact that the orange tree in your garden only comes up to your shoulders, but that is just one part of the tree that you see. Sometimes a tree’s roots, beneath the soil, are much bigger than the parts you see above the ground. It is with these roots a tree looks for water that gives it life, and makes its leaves look shiny, bright and healthy. In fact the leaves need to take in a lot of water to stay that way.Now you know the reason why trees shed their leaves in winter. The reason is simple: in winter, the soil gets cold and hard. And it is very, very difficult for a tree’s roots to find enough water in that frozen soil. So the tree makes a plan for these hard winter months; it sheds its leaves in autumn so that there are fewer leaves in winter. The fewer the leaves, the more is water saved in the cold winter months.You may now ask how the tree knows when to shed its leaves. The answer is simple: with the passing of summer and the onset of autumn, the days become shorter. The air, too, gets cooler. As winter sets in there is cooler weather and much more darkness. And that is the signal the tree is looking for; it knows that the time has come to shed most of its leaves.As soon as the tree catches the signal that it is time to shed leaves, it puts a fantastic plan into action. It cuts off the water supply of the leaf. It does this by sealing off the leaf stem from the branch. When the leaves do not get water to make their food they start dying. Their shiny, green colour changes to a dry yellow, red and brown. Finally the leaves fall.And when winter passes to make way for spring, the soil opens up and the root finds it easier to search for water, and to have more leaves. That is when trees start getting fresh leaves.",

A British company, called Electrotextiles, has created a dazzling range of clothes — clothes that have a mind of their own! Scientists, working for the company, have invented a fabric that can be blended with flexible electronic materials to create intelligent clothing. The result is elctronic garments.If you think the wearer has to be wired to different gadgets, think again. These designer clothes are wire-free, soft to touch and washable!! Like any electronic device, these high-tech clothes have to be powered. Currently, a tiny nine-volt battery serves the purpose. But the researchers hope that in the near future, the clothes will generate electricity by using body heat. These clothes are 100 per cent shock proof, they say.The Electrotextiles team has also created the world’s first cloth keyboard. This keyboard can be sewn into your trousers or skirt. To use this device, you will have to sit down and tap on your lap! These ‘lap-tap’ gadgets are all set to take over laptop computers!Another useful garment is the shirt-cum-mobile phone. This handy invention enables drivers to chat comfortably — with both hands on the wheel! Other popular electronic wear include the denim jacket (with flexible ear-phones stitched into the hood) and the electronic ski-jacket with a built-in heater. The ski-jacket is also programmed to send signals to a satellite. This technology is known as global positioning and can be used to track lost skiers and wandering kids.Having completed the cloth keyboard, scientists have already started work on a new project — a necktie that can be used as a computers’ mouse. What next? Do you have any ideas?",

And they do it so well that someone may just step over them thinking they are logs or the stem of a plant. That’s when they bite.It is surprising then, to know that these reptiles do not have a powerful vision. They can see you move if you are close by, but not if you are standing at a distance. Their hearing, too, is not very sharp. They hear sounds from the vibrations that come from the ground.Green snake with martini glass & olive.But how do they move so fast to catch their prey, you might ask. Simple. They use their tongue to do that. Snakes use their tongue not so much for tasting as for catching the scent of prey like frogs, lizards and birds. How they do it is very interesting.Inside their mouth, on top, is an organ or body part that has several nerve endings. It is called the Jacobson’s organ and its nerve endings are quick to catch any smell. So when snakes take out their tongue, what they are doing is catching interesting smells around them — like the smell of food, or a possible mate.Green rat snake with blue tongueThe fact that snakes have forked tongues makes their lives easier. Each fork is like a messenger. It carries the smell back to the Jacobson’s organ, or the headquarter, which makes out if the smell is of food or of a friend. Then it gets into action.",

    "article": "They are an amazing lot, they really are! They are absolute monkeys!The Squirrel Monkey has a long and slender tail. The tail serves many purposes. It helps the animal to keep its balance when it monkeys around, I mean, jumps from branch to branch.It also acts like a blanket during the night for, the monkey wraps itself cozily in its long tail! Except for some long-tailed large individuals, most squirrel monkeys are about the size of a squirrel.Douroucoulis are also called Owl-monkeys.They have round heads and round eyes like marbles. This animal makes its home in holes of trees, and sleeps in it the whole day. If someone taps on the tree, a Douroucouli wakes up and looks out to see who it is!The Golden Lion Marmoset is called so because it looks like a lion! It is as big as one and has a long, silky mane. But it doesn’t roar like a lion; it chirps and twitters like a bird!Here’s a monkey with a sad face, the Monk Saki. It has a long bushy tail, and when it sleeps, it looks like a bundle of dry leaves! It has a unique way of drinking water by wetting the fur on the back of its hand and licking it!!The Mangabey is a large monkey with a long tail. It makes small mewing and twittering sounds. Mangabeys love fruits. They have big teeth and pouches in their cheeks to store food in them until they want to eat it!The Spider Monkey has a long and strong tail which is like an extra arm. It has ridges underneath so that it can grip branches easily.In fact, it is so deft that it can even pick up something as small as a peanut! That’s not the end of the tail tale – these monkeys often hold tails just the way we hold hands! Spider monkeys love to swing through branches of trees, they do not like the ground so much.The Howler Monkey is the noisiest monkey. The female barks like a dog, and the male makes a deep roaring noise which can be heard several miles away! They have a special organ – a bony box in their throat which makes sounds that boom like a drum. Howler monkeys live high in the trees, and often march along the branches in long lines.The Uakari (pronounced wackari) is perhaps the strangest looking monkey. It is bald headed with a bright red face! It loves the sun, so it lives in the treetops where it can get lots of sunlight. (And if a Uakari is kept indoors away from the sun, its bright red face goes pale pink!)The Colobus monkey is a very picky eater – it eats only leaves. But since leaves by themselves are not very good food, the monkeys have to eat a huge amount of leaves to get enough nutrition. And because of this, Colobus monkeys have large stomachs!The Langur is also called a Leaf monkey.Since the leaves provide enough water, some Langurs can go for months without drinking! They have a long tail and a prominent ridge above the eyes.Langurs live in troops (a group of monkeys) of 3 to 120 individuals!The Probosis monkey is a leaf-eater too. The male adult has a very strange nose – it is like a pendulum! It hangs down over the monkey’s mouth to below its chin. Proboscis monkeys love to swim and sunbathe afterwards!The Guenon is a brightly coloured monkey, with stripes or spots on their noses! Others have moustaches or colourful beards. These marks help the monkeys to see each other in the dark forests!The Mandrill is a rather colourful monkey. The adult male has ribbed cheeks of blue and a long red nose. This display of colours becomes brighter when the animal is frightened, angry, or excited! Mandrills are powerful fighters and a troop (a group of monkeys) may even attack and kill a leopard!Baboons live in big family groups. They have strong canine teeth, jaws and limbs. The stronger males lead the group and all others obey.Baboons have the most unusual diet which includes scorpions, small animals, and most plants.The Capuchin is named so because of black cap of fur that resembles the cowl of a Capuchin monk. It is also called a ring-tailed monkey because its tail is coiled at the tip. It is one of the most intelligent monkeys. Capuchins live in the tops of large trees, rarely descending to the ground.",

    "article": "Most animals never even see their parents. Many never meet their fathers and some do not meet their mothers either. Some insects, fish, amphibians and reptiles hatch from fertilised eggs and face life on their own. And those animals who are raised by parents, are often reared by their mothers. But we found that there are some animal fathers who are great dads too.Catfish: A male sea catfish keeps the eggs of his young in his mouth until they are ready to hatch. He does not eat during this period, which may go several weeks.Cockroach: A father cockroach eats bird droppings to obtain precious nitrogen, which he carries back to feed his young.Duck: Most male ducks live as bachelors, but the ruddy duck of North America helps care for his young.Earthworms: Since earthworms have both male and female sex organs, every earthworm can be both a mother and a father. Animals that have both male and female organs are called hermaphrodites.Wolf: When the mother wolf gives birth, the father stands guard outside their den and brings food for the mother and pups. As they grow, he not only plays with them but also teaches them how to survive. Wolves continue to live together much as human families do.Frog: The male Darwin frog hatches his eggs in a pouch in his mouth. However, unlike the catfish, the existence of the pouch does not stop him from eating. Soon, the tadpoles lose their tails, become tiny frogs and jump out of his mouth!Monkey: There are small monkeys in South America called marmosets. Among these monkeys, the fathers take care of their babies from birth. When a marmoset is born, the father cleans it, keeps it safe and carries it to the mother only when it needs to be nursed. When the baby can eat solid food, it is the father who feeds the child.Penguin: A father emperor penguin bears the cold winds in the Antarctic for 60 days or more to protect his eggs, which he keeps on his feet, covered with a feathered flap. During this time, he does not eat a thing!The long-tailed Gentoo penguin incubates eggsMost father penguins lose about 25 pounds while they wait for their babies to hatch. Afterward, they feed the chicks a special liquid from their throats. The father penguin can go to eat and rest only after the mother comes to take charge.Rhea: Rheas are large South American birds and look like ostriches. Among rheas, it is always the father who takes care of the young. From the eggs to chicks, he feeds and protects them until they are old enough to survive on their own.Sand grouse: A father Namaqua sand grouse of Africa’s Kalahari Desert flies as far as 50 miles a day in order to soak himself in water so that his chicks can drink water from his feathers when he returns to his nest.Sea horse: The male sea horse has a pouch in which the mother lays her eggs. The father then looks after the eggs for about two months, until they hatch and leave the pouch. He continues to protect the young until they are able to live on their own.Siamese fighting fish: When the mother lays her eggs, the father catches them in his mouth, then drops them into a nest he has prepared. He guards the nest and protects the baby fish till they hatch.Now, isn’t that a huge list of great dads?",

Aldrin, famous for being the second man to land on the moon, is one of the few people working to promote tourism in space. But if the thought of a holiday in space is mind-boggling, the cost of that thought is even more so – almost $200 million for an out-of-the-world experience! Realising the need to make space travel as normal as buses or trains, an American company called the X Prize Foundation is trying to cut down the cost of space travel.If the company succeeds, one lucky human could be heading for a space vacation at the cost of a bus ticket! The foundation is organising a lottery for a seat on the rocket that will zoom up in space. There’s a slight catch, though. The rocket is yet to be designed.Since its inception in 1996, the X Prize Foundation has attracted several sponsors. It is now offering $10 million (about Rs 40 crore) for the best rocket design. Seventeen international teams, including a few amateurs, are competing to build the safest and most affordable passenger rocket.Space Tourism: Ready for a Skyrocketing HolidayThe Foundation’s officials say that for a craft to be eligible for the prize, it must fly twice within a 14-day period with three passengers on board. It must fly 100 km high into space. While none of the contestants are ready with their designs, a few are confident of creating the ideal spacecraft by the year 2002. The X Prize Foundation was founded in 1996, by a group of American businesspeople intent on creating low-cost space travel vehicles.The X Prize is formulated in the style of early aviation prizes. In the 1900s, hundreds of aviation prizes inspired different aircraft designs. The prizes also motivated pilots to set records which were hitherto thought of as impossible. Charles Lindbergh, was one such contestant, who became the first person to fly nonstop across the Atlantic alone. Like the organisations of yore, the X Prize Foundation officials are hoping that their efforts will change the way people view space flight — and tourism.",

    "title": "Spiders and their Magical Web",
    "article": "Most of us have come across cobwebs that accumulate in our walls, and ceilings when we dust our homes. The webs are under tables, cellars, and sometimes across branches and leaves at the park. All these cobwebs are the work of spiders.Spider webs are fine silken threads. Originally spiders spun silk to protect their eggs and to line their nests. But later they adapted to use this silk to weave a web and trap their prey. Sometimes it is also used to provide a safety line so that if they fall, they get suspended in the air.But despite all this evidence, most spiders do not spin webs. They rely on their speed – like the common house spider – and mobility to catch their prey or to steer away from danger. Spiders that don’t spin webs are sometimes venomous as they lurk in burrows, trees and buildings until their prey comes to them. These spiders rely on speed and surprise rather than webs.A spider spinning its webNearly all the world’s 40,000 species of spiders originated from marine creatures about 400 million years ago. But these spiders have changed themselves through a process called adaptive radiation. This means that spiders have evolved to fit their surroundings and environment according to the changes in nature, food and climate.Spiders are not insects. Biologists classify them as ‘arachnids’. Arachnids are different from insects as they have eight legs and no antennae. Scorpions, mites and ticks also come in this category.Spider webs are extremely light and incredibly strong. They are finer than silk but have a breaking strain greater than that of steel. The silk of the golden orb spider found across the world is the strongest known natural fibre.Different kinds of spiders spin and weave different webs. The trapdoor spider makes a trip line, across which insects trip and alerts the spider. The trip line is similar to a piece of thread stretched at a height of ten inches across a doorway. Since we don’t expect any barrier we tend to trip on this line and fall down.Closeup of a jumping spiderThe American black widow spins a tangled web and attaches it to the ground or a tree like an anchor while stretch a fine sticky line of thread to their hideout. Unsuspecting insects get caught in the web and the spider hauls them in.The net-throwing spiders weave a web like a napkin holding it with their front four legs like a fisherman ready to throw his net. They lunge on to their prey and capture them in the net. The more the prey struggles the more the victim gets imprisoned.However, the bolas spiders adopt the most interesting technique. The bolas spider dangles a large sticky globule (thick mass) at the end of a single line of silk thread. The globule attracts moths. When the spider senses the vibrations of the wings, it twirls the globule faster and faster like a bolas, and traps the moth on this lump of bait. It then lures the moth up like a fisherman landing a fish!Spiders are unique in other ways. They can detect infrasonic sounds (Human hearing is between 20 to 20,000 hertz. Anything above 20,000 hertz is called ultrasonic and anything below is called infrasonic.) caused naturally by earthquakes and some respond to sounds above 45,000 hertz.All spiders except spiders of the Uloboridae family are venomous. The potency of the poison varies from specie to specie. While some can kill the prey, others paralyse the prey.Spider bites are rarely fatal to humans. They may cause pain or sickness but rarely death. However, in the rare case of the Australian funnel-web spider, animals manage to survive the bite while the poison is fatal to humans!",

    "article": "Chimpu and his grandfather had gone to the park for an evening walk. After Chimpu had played with his friends for over an hour, he came back sweating and tired, to sit beside his grandfather at the park bench. There he found his grandfather throwing peanuts, brought from home, to the scampering squirrels at his feet.In fact, bushy-tailed squirrels are a common sight in the city’s parks and gardens. This frisky little rodent is constantly scampering around, and it is indeed rare to come across one perfectly still.It has long been observed that tree squirrels often stash away nuts in holes of trees where they stay. This is done by squirrels and most animals as a stand-by measure during the cold winter months when food becomes scarce.Some tree squirrels, on the other hand, bury their nuts in the ground. More often than not, the squirrels hide it in so many holes that they forget where they have buried them! Some of these hidden-and-forgotten nuts, uneaten seeds and other squirrel delicacies, germinate and grow into new plants.The grey squirrel, for instance, tends to bury acorns about 100 ft away from the tree that produced it. Sometimes their sensitive noses help them retrieve their cache, while at other times the forgotten seed germinates.Red squirrel with nutA survey carried out by Canadian scientists shows that the red squirrels of North America and Canada start hoarding nuts for their young even before they’re born. Apparently these rodents are just as foresighted as human parents!The female red squirrel stashes away nuts for herself and creates an additional food cache, nearly four months before her offspring is born. This is so similar to humans saving up for their future child. And when the baby squirrel is all set to leave the nest, the mother squirrel gives her young, her extra storage of nuts.What is particularly exciting is the fact that this is perhaps the first time scientists have proved that animals show concern for their young – before they are born. The research team insists that the young squirrels (that receive the nuts from their mother) are more likely to survive in the long run, as they do not have to immediately forage for food and expose themselves to predators.Did you know that squirrels are found in all parts of the world except Australia and the deserts of Africa? The common striped squirrel, that we often see, belongs to a group of rodents that includes the ground squirrels, flying squirrels and chipmunks. Squirrels come in all shapes and range in size from about five inches for the pygmy squirrels of Africa, to the 36-inch long giant squirrels of Asia.Squirrels are chiefly of two types – tree-dwelling and ground-dwelling. There is yet another subspecies known as flying squirrels.Tree squirrels spend most of their time in trees and descend to the ground in search of food. They are active during the day sleeping at night in the trees, snuggled up in leafy nests. Ground squirrels usually dig their own burrows, while others prefer settling down in a hole in the ground or in an opening between rocks.Contrary to their popular name, flying squirrels, like other ‘flying’ reptiles (snakes, geckos, lizards) cannot fly. They merely glide from higher to lower tree branches by means of a blanket-like membrane of furry skin stretched between the front and hind legs. This membrane is called the ‘patagium’ (pronounced pa-tha-ghee-yum) and acts like a parachute helping the animal to engage in controlled gliding.Although the distance of most glides is no more than a few feet, the giant flying squirrel of Asia has been known to glide more than 1,300 feet!",

    "title": "Storm Petrel: A Bird that Walks on Water",
    "article": "You must have heard of St. Peter, the saint, who is said to have walked on water. Well, there is a bird which is named after the saint, because it looks as if it is walking on water.It is called the stormy petrel. It is not known whether the petrel actually walks on water. But, it somehow manages to stay above water. This gives the impression that it is walking on water.Wilson’s Storm Petrel (Oceanites oceanicus): A bird that seems to walk on waterBut, if a storm arises, the petrel cannot “walk on water”. So, it is forced to remain in the air day and night, till the storm subsides!The petrel has webbed feet, which help aid its “walking” action. In fact, the petrel is the smallest of all web-footed birds. It is about the size of a swallow.The petrel lives in oceans and comes on to the land only during the breeding season. There are about 80 kinds of petrels.The petrel that appears off the eastern and southern coasts of the United States during the summer is called the Wilson’s petrel. It is sooty black in colour and has a white patch on its rump. It is about 18 cm long and has a short bill and long stilt-like legs. It greets the people with a friendly chatter, but it is not a song bird.Another stormy petrel that is commonly seen in the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea in the northern hemisphere is called the Leach’s petrel. It is brownish black in colour and builds its nest in holes or burrows in the ground, or in hidden spots among rocks.When the Leach petrel is breeding, it manages to remain completely hidden. In fact, hundreds of birds may be gathered near one spot without being seen!The largest variety is that of the giant petrel, which is about 88 cm long. Another one, called the diving petrel is between 18 to 25 cm long.All petrels belong to the Tubinare family, because their nostrils are shaped like tubes.",

    "article": "When you pat your pet dog, he wags his tail. That is his way of saying that he loves you. And, if you pay attention, you will see that he uses his tail to say so many things. Every movement of the tail means a different thing.If the dog is wagging its tail, it is a sign of friendliness, if his tail is straight, it means he is getting ready for a fight and if his tail is tucked behind his legs, it means he is giving up the fight.A dog wagging its tailUnlike the dogs, the cats’ tail language is not so expressive. When a cat feels threatened, he puffs himself up to appear big and his tail quivers with tension. And when he is displeased about something, he lashes out his tail.The tail language of dogs and cats has a little story behind it.Earlier, when dogs and cats had not become friends with human beings, they were predators. They used to hunt other animals for their food.When dogs went out hunting with their friends, the tail language came handy. When they were close to each other, they could use facial expressions to talk. But, for long distance communication, they used their tails.Unlike the dog, the cat likes to hunt alone. So, he did not need to use the tail language too often. As a result, his vocabulary in the tail language is much smaller than the dog’s.",

    "article": "Almost 20,000 years ago, a group of hunting tribesmen attacked an enormous elephant like animal called the Woolly Mammoth. A fierce battle was fought as the prehistoric tribesmen armed with spears and stone catapults attacked the Mammoth.The Mammoth, almost twice the size of a modern African Elephant, charged and stomped. And as a spear pierced its heart, it gave one last heart wrenching cry and fell to the ground with a loud thud, a sound that reverberated through the mountains.As the cries of the Mammoth died out, a thunder followed. The snow-covered mountain slopes gave away in a giant avalanche. The avalanche covered the body of the dying Mammoth and it froze. The body remained in a frozen state for many many years, till it was discovered by another group of humans 20,000 years later.Artistic recreation of baby & mother Wooly MammothThis time it was not a hunting tribe, but a group of paleontologists, armed with pick axes and powerful scientific instruments.Paleontologists are scientists who dig into the earth in search of remnants or impressions of pre-historic life. This would help them learn more about the history of life on earth.Fossils: Tell tale stories of life and deathThe skull of a Mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) at a dig site in South Dakota, United States.These remnants are called fossils. Fossils are generally formed when an animal dies and gets buried in some material that prevents weathering and decay.But, not all fossils have their entire body intact like the Mammoth. Sometimes, the body of the animal decays and the bones are left behind. Or, in some other conditions, the bones and flesh disappear, but an impression of the body structure is left behind.These bones and impressions help paleontologists to put together pieces of the organism and how its life must have been. The dinosaur was discovered in a similar way – after scientists found dinosaur bones.A window into the pastSome of the fossils that have been discovered are millions of years old – some of them belong to the time when life began on earth, 450 million years ago.In the Grand Canyon, in Colorado, US, the walls show separate layers of soil, each belonging to a different era. Each layer has fossils of different organisms that reveal how each age differed from the other in plant and animal life.The fossils, thus help scientists to put together the events that occurred in the history of earth and the impacts it had on animal and plant life.",

    "title": "The Baby Current Which Destroys",
    "article": "Did you know that the period between November 1997 and November 1998 was the hottest year recorded on earth? In fact, six of the first eight months of the year were the warmest since humans began recording temperatures on earth in 1866.Weather experts say one of the causes behind the warming of the earth’s atmosphere, or global warming, is El Nino, a water current in the Pacific Ocean.But why should a water current create heat in the earth’s atmosphere, one would ask.Actually, water currents could be hot or cold depending on their origin, their speed and the pull of gravity at a particular point in the sea. Swimmers say that they have come across places which are distinctly hot, or cold in different parts of the same sea.El Nino is a very powerful current. It flows from New Guinea and the Micronesian islands some 14,000 km across the Pacific to coastal regions of Peru. It usually lasts between fourteen and eighteen months, and may vanish for three to eight years.But when it flows, it moves huge amounts of really warm water. As it does so, it heats the water above. The heated water shifts to the north and south. It piles up off South America, leaving colder currents in the western Pacific. The warmth of the water actually affects the weather of the place it reaches.Besides, the Pacific Ocean is equal in area to all the landmasses on earth combined. Naturally, whatever happens here can influence the world weather. And El Nino’s role in changes in weather has already been proved. In February 1992, there were floods in southern California. Satellite images showed that there was a clear link between El Nino and the floods.The origins of El Nino are not really known. It is said that it is caused by volcanoes on or just below the sea bed. It is believed that the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, in the Philippines, triggered El Nino that year. But no one really knows for sure.EL Nino was first discovered by fishermen based at Spanish ports along the Pacific coast of South America in the 17th century. They named it El Nino, which means Christ child, because it flows during Christmas time. But not every year.El Nino is not the only water current which creates havoc on the weather. Another water current called La Nina is believed to have caused fierce storms in northern Europe, a deluge in Australia and a drought in parts of South America. But, unlike El Nino, La Nina is a cold Pacific current. La Nina is believed to be the sister of El Nino.",

    "title": "The Colours of Light",
    "article": "A beam of light seems to have no colour. Actually, it is made up of coloured rays. Usually, these coloured rays combine to form the white light. But it is possible to see the different colours at certain times. For instance, when it rains and the sun’s rays pass through raindrops. Since the raindrop has many sides or surfaces, the rays split up into a fanshape of different colours. And we see the rainbow. Violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.Light moves through space as waves. These waves have a frequency and a wavelength. The number of ups (crest) and downs (trough) a wave touches in one second is called the frequency. The distance between one crest and another or one trough and another is called its wavelength.The coloured light rays have different wavelengths, which form an array, called the light spectrum. Violet and red form the two extremes of the spectrum. Any light, whose wavelength is shorter than violet or longer than that of red cannot be seen by us.There are two more reasons why see a particular colour and not another. It depends on the material the light falls on. Another reason is how the eye sees the colour.So a ripe tomato is bright red because its skin reflects the red light in sunlight, and absorbs all other colours. By itself, the tomato is not red.In the same way, some objects appear to change colour if they are tilted towards or away from the light. And if the light source is changed, an object’s colour may alter. The changing colours of the sea provide the best example.When light strikes water, most of it is reflected. Some of it goes under the surface. The sea gets its colour when light is scattered from beneath the surface.Also, different wavelengths of light penetrate to different depths.Thus, if the water is clear, the red and yellow wavelengths of light are absorbed, leaving only blue-green light to be scattered back. That is why clear seas appear bluer.The dark blue of the Mediterranean Sea comes from the sky and its reflection in the water. On cloudy days the same sea could appear to be grey.Also cells that are sensitive to light are distributed differently in the retina of the eye in different people. That is why people often fight about the colour of the sea or flower or car that they are seeing. They should just make “light” of their differences.",

If you see them at night on a tree, you might think it is a brightly lit Christmas tree. That is the kind of light these fireflies produce.But the light they send out does not have heat, like the bulbs we use. The firefly’s light is cold. Actually these beetles could be the most efficient bulbs if only we knew how to use them. For almost all the energy they produce gets changed into bright light – cool light.Kids around a tree covered with firefliesHow do they do it? The back portion of their abdomens are transparent. There are cells of crystals or chemical substances inside which get broken down by enzymes. Some energy is released in the form of light.The fireflies send out light signals at fixed intervals. And the purpose behind it is to attract beetles for mating. But one firefly’s signal is different from another’s, depending on its sex and the type of family it belongs to. If a firefly sends a signal at a fixed interval but gets a response either too soon or too late, it will ignore the signal. It is like a perfect dance sequence. If you are faster or slower than your partner, the dance fails.Closeup of a fireflyFireflies come from two families of beetles. One family of fireflies is usually found in Europe, North America and Australia. They are found on trees. The other family of fireflies is found in the Pacific islands. There is another type of beetle which gives out a softer light. It is called the glow worm.",

    "title": "The Cool and Cunning Lark",
    "article": "The very mention of summer and heat makes us think of desert land. Countless films have shown thirsty travellers lost in the desert, uttering the words, ‘Water! Wa-a-ter, waaa&mldr;” But then what do you do if the temperature even in the desert shade is as high as 50 degree centigrade, hot winds almost cut you up into pieces, and there is no water, or even saliva in your mouth?If you are smart like the desert animals, you would probably sleep during the day and move about at night. And, like these animals, you would make a hole in the ground and wait till the sun goes down.The Cool and Cunning LarkBut, birds do not have the ability to dig burrows. They have to think of other means to escape the sun, by thinking smartly. The desert lark, found in the Arabian desert, is one such creature. Borrow or steal another animal’s burrow is its philosophy. It spends its days in burrows made by the Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard.Often, the original owner of the house, the lizard, also is found in the burrow. But since the lizard is a vegetarian and quite happy to have company, the bird is safe. The Economist magazine has reported these fascinating facts discovered by two scientists in the desert near Taif, Saudi Arabia. The scientists have found that there are as many as 30 burrows in every square kilometre of desert land. And that probably saves the lark’s life.Out in the sun, the hoopoe lark’s body rapidly loses water — almost 10 per cent of its body weight in one hour in direct sunlight. Even in the shade, it loses about 1.4 grams of water an hour. It saves itself by lying flat on the ground.But the lark is not a bird that believes in sharing and caring, as the scientists found out. They took out a lark from one burrow and placed it in another which was already occupied by another bird. That one was not willing to share its space with the outsider and fought with it. Which is rather strange, for the lizard burrow has enough space for many of them. It is almost three to four metres long. But then that’s the way the lark is.",

These tentacles have hundreds of thousands of tiny cells, which contain a cobra-like poison. When a victim brushes against the tentacles, the poison is injected into his body, killing him in less than five minutes.Sounds scary, doesn’t it? It is scary. Because, medical science has not yet found an antidote or cure for it.Ninety five per cent of the sea wasp’s body consists of water. So it is colourless. And, it can be very elusive. You can spot it in shallow tropical waters only if you look very carefully.Chironex Fleckeri, commonly known as sea wasp jelly fish is considered to be one of the the deadliest creatures in the world.The size of a sea wasp varies from 4 cm to 20 cm across and 10 cm in length. It has purple or bluish tentacles which can be seen coming out of the bell-shaped body. These may reach up to a length of more than a metre. One wasp may have up to 50 tentacles. And one such tentacle may have as many as 750,000 stinging cells.

    "title": "The Deadly King Cobra",
    "article": "Belonging to the family Elapidae, the name Cobra is popularly applied to African and Asian snakes that are capable of spreading long ribs in their necks into a hood when threatened. There are six species of cobras: the Naja, the south African ringhal (Hemachatus), king cobra (Ophiophagus), water cobra (Boulengerina), tree cobra (Pseudohaje), and shield-nose cobra (Aspidelaps).The king cobra or Hamadryad holds a record length of 5.58 m (18.3ft) for a venomous snake.It has a head as big as a man’s hand and can stand tall enough to look you straight in the eye. The hood plays a big part in its fearsome ‘threat posture’. The king cobra can stand up to one third of its total length or from 3 to 6 ft height and has the ability to move forward in the intimidating posture. An upright posture without the hood extended is normally a friendly gesture and the snake often assumes this pose to see over bushes or tall grasses.Its deadly fangs are almost half-an-inch long. And the venom could stun your nervous system and stop your breathing. If the venom comes in contact with the human eyes, it can cause an immediate and severe irritation of the conjunctiva and cornea that, if untreated, could result in permanent blindness. Incidentally, the king’s venom is actually less lethal than a common cobra’s. However, the king makes up for it by delivering more venom per bite as much as 7 millimetres of liquid — which is enough to kill an elephant or 20 people.Despite being colour blind, the King cobra’s eyesight is better than most snakes. It can see a moving person almost 330 ft away.King cobras actually do hear thereby debunking the common misconception that snakes are audibly challenged due to the absence of external ears. Sound travels from the skin to the jaw muscle to the quadrate bone next to the ear bone. From there, sound waves pass on to the inner ear. Nevertheless, the responses to a snake charmer’s flute are due to visual cues.The King cobra’s hissing sounds more like a dog’s growl and is much lower than most snakes. The hiss is produced by tiny holes in the trachea, which is resonated by the lung.They are cannibals. Besides eating non-venomous snakes like the rat snakes, they also dine on venomous Indian cobras, kraits and even small King cobras.With no cutting teeth they gulp down every meal. The cobra’s digestive tract is like a long straight tube. Blunt teeth puncture the food and the venom’s enzymes start the digestive process. From the long stomach, food travels through the small intestine, the large intestine and then out of the cloaca.Snakes generally shed their skin when they grow too big for the old skin in a process called ecdysis. A King cobra sheds 4 to 6 times a year in a two-week shedding cycle. However, in the first year they shed every month. During the shedding time, the king drinks a lot of water to help separate the itchy old skin from the new one underneath. It then rubs against the rough edges to start the peeling process. Besides the new skin, the King uncovers new fangs, teeth and tongue.A King cobra’s colour varies from olive brown to grey to deep shiny black depending upon the habitat. Despite its aggressive reputation, the King cobra is actually more cautious than many smaller snakes. It only attacks people when it is cornered or in self-defence or to protect its eggs. They appear to be much more intelligent than other cobras.During the mating season, the potential mates find each other by sending scent messages. Both male and females give off a musk smell in the mating season.About 2 months after mating, the queen lays a clutch of 20-40 eggs. She will guard these for about 2 more months. The King cobras are the only snakes that make nests for their eggs. The nest consists of mounds of leaves and debris that the queen whips together. Just before the babies emerge, the mother leaves. When they hatch, the brightly marked hatchlings are raring to go. About 14 inches long and as thick as your little finger, they emerge self-sufficient. Their venom is as potent as an adult King cobra.King cobras are usually found in India, Vietnam, southern China, Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. One of King cobra’s natural habitats is the cool undergrowth of rain forests. It stays near streams where temperature and humidity are relatively constant. However deforestation, often due to growing populations and agriculture, is shrinking the King’s native habitat.Hindus consider cobras as manifestation of Lord Shiva — god of destruction and regeneration. Besides, its aggressive reputation and its lethal defences have inspired people to view its powers as god-like. In India, since time immemorial, people have revered King cobras and placed them at the center of their most scared rites.",

    "article": "If you have viewed a crescent moon on a clear night, you would have observed an eerie glow around the moon. This is called earthshine. Do you know why the moon glows?The eerie glow around a crescent moon is called earthshine.Our earth and the moon act as giant mirrors that reflect sunlight. Actually most objects reflect light. A mirror reflects almost all the light that falls on it. And an object that does not reflect light is called opaque.The sun’s rays contain heat and light, which keep the earth warm. However, our earth reflects as much as 30 percent of the heat and light that falls on it. This is how our earth manages to keep its temperature under control.A lot of the reflected light reaches the moon, which, in turn, reflects it back to earth. The light that is reflected back from the moon makes it glow.Global warming and earthshineScientists are now using this reflected light or earthshine as a thermometer to monitor earth’s health.New observations conducted at southern California’s Big Bear Solar Observatory suggest that the earth has dimmed by about 2.5 percent over the past five years. Which means it is not as bright as it was earlier. This decrease in the earth’s brightness, they point out, is connected to the increase in the global temperature.In the last century, humans have burned large amounts of fossil fuels like petrol and diesel for their energy needs. These fossil fuels are mostly made up of an element called carbon. The burning of the fuels has released a lot of carbon into the earth’s atmosphere.Carbon has a tendency to absorb heat and light. The extra amount of carbon in the earth’s atmosphere has increased the amount of heat and light it absorbs. As a result, the earth is getting warmer and is not reflecting as much light as it used to. Therefore, it is getting dimmer. Consequently, the earthshine is losing its brightness.Steven Koonin, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, points out that earthshine could reveal how hot our planet is becoming.“It’s really amazing, if you think about it, that you can look at this ghostly reflection on the Moon and measure what Earth’s climate is doing”, says Koonin in an article in the National Geographic web site – www.nationalgeographic.com.",

    "article": "During its life span, our planet has suffered the impact of close to 30 small planets, up to 10 miles in diameter and travelling 60 times the speed of sound. Each such impact releases about a thousand times as much energy as would be released if all the nuclear powers exploded all their present weapon stocks.About 5,000 giant meteorities with diameters of more than a kilometre have hit the Earth over the past 600 million years, with an average strike rate of one per 120,000 years. Meteorites with diameters greater than 300 metres have hit the Earth once in every 10,000 years.About once every century a similar object can be expected to travel past Earth. And once in every 250,000 years, on an average, the Earth and such a body will collide. The impact of the collision will release energy equivalent to 10,000 megaton hydrogen bombs and will make a crater some 20 kilometres in diameter.In 1937, a body about a kilometre in diameter, later named Hermes, passed within 800,000 kilometres of the Earth, no more than twice the distance of the moon. It has not been seen again.Such events can also destroy up to 90 per cent of all living organisms, from the microscopic to the macroscopic. The impact makes the Earth ring like a bell, and its impact may be felt by the planet for may be a million years or more.Hoba meteorite near Tsumeb, NamibiaThankfully, most of these intruders burn themselves out as ‘shooting stars’ in friction with our air. But due to the shower of meteoric materials, chiefly dust, falling from the sky, the Earth’s weight increases by about 100,000 pounds each year.These interesting facts come from the ‘Woodpecker volume 2000’, an annual compilation on the state of the planet, published by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehradun, in north India.",

A lot of this garbage ends up polluting the ground water and also the rivers and seas.Actually, a large part of this junk, especially the biodegradable waste (waste that can be decomposed) can be disposed in a more efficient manner, without polluting water bodies. Many countries are now doing it by using a cheap and eco-friendly option – the earthworm.Yes, earthworms have been in the business of decomposing waste and enriching the soil for thousands of years. It is only in the past few years that people have realised the importance of these little pests.Earthworms busy decomposing (recycling) wasteMeasuring three to four inches in length, the earthworm (called the red worm) can eat food equal to its own weight in a day. The nutrition-rich waste it excretes is known as “worm castings” and is used as organic manure to enhance the fertility of soil.In many foreign countries, worm bins are being sold to households. The bin is made of plastic or wood and has small holes to allow good ventilation. The owners need to create the proper environment for the worms and line the bin with worm castings, shredded newspaper and fruit and veggie peels.Of course, they need worms. At least 1,600 – 4,000 wrigglers! These worms will munch through food garbage for years as long as the bin is warm, dark and has plenty of air circulation.The Pune-based Bhawalkar Earthworm Research Institute and many other agencies in different cities are actively involved in teaching people the importance of vermiculture.A voluntary agency called Wastewise (in Bangalore) has organised 400 residents into a group to collect household biodegradable wastes and recycle it using vermiculture technology.The compost (earthworm castings) is then sold back to the residents of the area for use in their kitchen gardens. Mumbai too has its share of vermiculture units, with the Bal Bhavan (an educational institute) taking an interest in the technology.There is a small garden near Hassaram Rijhumal College (Churchgate, Mumbai) which has a vermiculture pit and which uses worm castings for manure. Interestingly, Japan imports 3000-million tonnes of earthworm per annum for vermiculture projects in the country. However, India still has a long way to go before vermiculture becomes popular among the masses.",

The Indian prefers the soft sound of the wind darting over the face of a pond, and the smell of the wind itself, cleansed by a mid-day rain, or scented with the pinon pine.The air is precious to the red man, for all things share the same breath – the beast, the tree, the man, they all share the same breath. The white man does not seem to notice the air he breathes. Like a man dying for many days, he is numb to the stench. But if we sell you our land, you must remember that the air is precious to us, that the air shares its spirit will all the life it supports. The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also receives his last sigh. And if we sell you our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where even the white man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow’s flowers.So we will consider your offer to buy our land. If we decide to accept, I will make one condition: The white man must treat the beasts of this land as his brothers…What is man without the beast? If all the beasts were gone, man would die from a great loneliness of spirit. For whatever happens to the beasts, soon happens to man. All things are connected.A Native American maskYou may teach to your children that the ground beneath their feet is the ashes of our grandfather’s. So that they will respect the land, tell your children that the earth is rich with the lives of our kin. Teach your children what we have taught our children, that the earth is our mother. Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth. If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves.This we know: the earth does not belong to man; man belongs to the earth. This we know. All things are connected like blood which unites one family. All things are connected. Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth. Man did not weave the web of life: he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself…We may be brothers after all. We shall see. One thing we know, which the white man may one day discover – our God is the same God. You may think now that you own Him as you wish to own our land; but you cannot. He is the God of man, and His compassion is equal for the red man and the white. This earth is precious to Him, and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its Creator. The white too shall pass….But in you perishing you will shine brightly, fired by the strength of the God who brought you to this land and for some special purpose gave you dominion over this land and over the red man. That destiny is a mystery to us, for we do not understand when the buffalo are all slaughtered, the wild horses are tamed, the secret corners of the forest heavy with scent of many men and the view of the ripe hills blotted by talking wires. Where is the thicket? Gone. Where is the eagle? Gone. The end of living and the beginning of survival.",

    "title": "The Exotic Peacock",
    "article": "Come monsoons, and we immediately think about the beautiful peacock, dancing in the rain, with its luscious tail spread out behind it. Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful birds in the world and a native of the Indian sub-continent, it is not surprising that the Peacock was anointed as the national bird of India in 1963.Hailing from the pheasant family, these exotic birds are cherished for their colourful plumes and eggs. The peacocks, more appropriately called peafowls, (peacock refers to the male) are found in lowland forests and hills usually in small groups consisting of one male and several females.Peafowls are long-legged birds. The male, known as the peacock, has a blue head with green and purple highlights and a crown-like tuft. Its face has white stripes and the back is green and blue with black undersides. The extraordinarily long tails of males have strong shafts and magnificent colours and extend far beyond the tail, which has twenty feathers. They form a train with oscillate designs and the fan is supported by hidden tail feathers which are much shorter. The primary feathers and tail are of chestnut colour and the train is green with bronze and is covered with blue and green spots that appear to be eyes. The females look quite dowdy in comparison. They do not have the train but have a crown-like tuft.Though they can fly strongly for short distances, peafowls rarely fly. They are terrestrial and roost at nights.Omnivorous by nature, they obtain most of their food by scratching the leaf litter with their strong feet. They eat anything from seeds, grains to small reptiles. They enjoy eating young cobras.Peafowls are polygamous and live in small families. Interestingly the mating season of peacocks coincides with the monsoon season in India. During monsoons, the male and female let out a meowing call which is commonly interpreted as `minh- ao’, which means there will be rain. With the onset of the mating season, the male displays its full trail of feathers to the females. After mating, the peahen makes a nest in the underbush and lays 4 to 8 eggs, which are incubated for about 28 days. The young ones are watched over by the peahen until they can take care of themselves.Portrait of peacock dancing with its feathers openKnown for their fierce, lively and courageous tempers, the males do not get along with one another and when faced with danger the peafowls become very aggressive.There are three types of peafowls. The Indian or blue peafowl, the green peafowl of Burma and IndoChina and a rare and aberrant form, the Congo peacock, found in the forests of Congo basin in Africa.Several myths and legends have been spun around these elegant birds. Peacocks can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman mythologies. It was supposed to be the favourite bird of Goddess Juno. In India, peacocks are associated with Lord Krishna and Karthikeyan.",

    "article": "There is a fish called the blackspot angelfish, which can change from female to male. No, it cannot do it by simply wishing to become male. The change happens for a specific reason.The angel fish live in groups. And each group has one male fish, which is blue in colour, and four female fish, which are yellow in colour.The male angelfish is the strongest and largest member of the group. He is the one who protects and looks after the females and acts like their ‘security guard’. When the male dies, the group needs a ‘security guard’. This is when the largest female fish in the group begins to change its appearance.Blackspot Angelfish: A tropical marine fish which can change from female to maleShe begins to grow larger in size. After a week, she starts changing colour, from yellow to blue. Slowly, her behaviour towards the females changes. She begins behaving like a male. Two weeks later, black stripes appear on her body. This indicates that the gender change is complete. She is now completely male!This process of changing gender is called hermaphroditism.Another interesting fact about angelfish is that they have an occupation in the fish world. Most of them act as ‘cleaners’ for other fish. They pick parasites and dead tissue from the body of other fish.The angel fish are among the most brightly coloured fish of the sea. You can also see them in home aquaria. People prefer to keep them because of the interesting patterns on them. These patterns help them to hide from predators. Often, the young ones are differently coloured than the adults.At night, when these fish become inactive, their colours may change. Among the better-known species are the black and gold angelfish of the Indo-Pacific, the French angelfish, Pomacanthus paru (or P. arcuatus), a black and yellow species of the Atlantic, and the queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris), a blue and yellow fish of the Atlantic.They can be found in the freshwaters of South America, in warm seas and coral reefs and can grow up to a length of 17 inches. They usually swim singly or in pairs. They have thinly compressed bodies and a strong spine located in the lower part of the cheekbone. Their diet consists mainly of sponge and algae.",

So, its house is always surrounded with colourful flowers and shells. These objects are not just thrown together haphazardly. The bird arranges them very carefully and even tries out different patterns before deciding on the final look of the garden.Some species of gardener birds even decorate the interior of their nests.

    "article": "All of us know how crooks are caught. We have seen it in film after film: the police inspector matches the fingerprints on the scene of the crime with the suspect’s fingerprints. And the culprit goes to prison.Fingerprinting has remained one of the best ways to catch a person with a criminal record. The technique was foolproof, for no two people have matching fingerprints — even identical twins.Unfortunately, things are not so simple any more. Crooks have become smarter and are very careful not to leave fingerprint traces. While some wipe all the surfaces they touch, others prefer using gloves. British police are now using different ways to nab or catch offenders.Thermal imagingHow do they do it? They try to identify inidividuals by the heat patterns of their bodies. There are lots of blood vessels in our body and all of these emit heat in the form of infra-red radiation. The temperature of skin over blood vessels is thus more than that of the surrounding area. One square inch of skin contains up to 15 feet of blood vessels! (If all the blood vessels of an adult were to be laid in a straight line, it would cover more than 160,000 kilometres!)Using gadgets that detect infra-red radiation patterns, British police can now identify a disguised crook even in a crowded area! Special video cameras programmed to detect infra-red radiation record the heat pattern generated by the person. This infra-red pattern is then fed into a computer which picks up a match instantly from its records. The suspect is identified. With the police hot on their trail, criminals are going to find it rather tough to escape undetected!",

    "title": "The Hows and Whys of Bubble Gum",
    "article": "Chew this question: What is small and pink, tastes sweet, can be chewed for hours without it dissolving, yet is not to be swallowed? Some doctors feel that it helps to relieve stress. Others think it is good for the teeth. Americans are constantly rolling it about in their mouth and the US army gives it as part of field rations. No guesses for the correct answer. Yes, it is chewing gum or bubble gum as it is often called because you can blow large bubbles that go ‘pop’!Ancient Greeks in 50 A.D. chewed resin, similar to gum, taken from the bark of the mastic tree. Thousands of years ago, the Mayans of Mexico chewed a substance called chicle, a rubbery substance, extracted from the sapodilla tree that grows mainly in Central America. European settlers quickly learnt the art of chewing the sap of the spruce tree from the Native Americans.From sap they chewed on to sweetened paraffin wax, which often broke up into tiny pieces. But it was the famous Mexican general Santa Anna who introduced chicle to the Americans. When he settled in New York in 1869 he introduced the chewy chicle to Thomas Adams, a local chemist.Adams tried to make chicle into rubber but he didn’t succeed. In 1870, Adams introduced “Black Jack”, the first manufactured flavoured gum that is still sold today. Chicle, like rubber bands, doesn’t dissolve when you chew on it. Instead, it gets softer the more it is chewed in the warmth of your mouth.In the late 1880s, two brothers, Frank and Henry Fleer, entered the chewing gum business. Henry covered chicle with a white candy coating and developed what is known now as Chiclets. Meanwhile, in 1906, Frank developed a sticky gum that he called Blibber-Blubber bubble gum.The Market Theater Gum Wall is a local landmark in downtown Seattle. This brick alleyway wall is covered in used chewing gum which is several inches thick at places.The Blibber-Blubber gum failed as it was too sticky and in 1928, Walter Diemer, an accountant for Fleer invented the modern bubble gum. Bubble gums consist of sugar, corn syrup, softeners, flavouring and latex to make it stretch.The first bubble gum was pink in colour as it was the only colour available. He called it the Dubble Bubble gum and the name stuck to it like gum. Though bubble gums come in all colours, pink is still the most popular color sold today.Until the 1940s, chewing gum was still made of chicle. But soon chemists learned to make artificial gum and replaced chicle. These gum bases are essentially synthetic rubbers that resemble chicle. They are both natural and artificially made, and mixed with sugar and other flavourings to make chewing gum. The flavouring is released in the mouth as you chew the gum.Parents normally worry that the gum will stick to the stomach if swallowed and cause digestive problems. Or that the child may choke as the gum may stick to the windpipe!Although chewing gum sticks easily to hair, shoe soles and is commonly stuck to the bottom of theatre seats, the gum cannot stick to the moist inner lining of the stomach or intestines. It passes right through without a problem. Yes, it does take a while for it to come out, but it certainly comes out!Most people are not aware that chewing gum is a fibre like the skins of fruit and vegetables, but they chew it nonetheless.If ever you have the misfortune to get gum stuck in your hair or shoes, rubbing it with peanut butter will help remove it. To remove gum from your shirt or pant, apply an ice cube so it hardens and then chip it off. But if you insist on blowing huge bubbles to set a record, be prepared to have some gum sticking to your face as it pops!",

    "title": "The Importance of the Mangrove Forest",
    "article": "Tropical coastlines and marshy areas around the world have one thing in common: mangrove forests. These consist of trees and shrubs that throw out many prop roots and sustain a large variety of aquatic animals, birds and plants. These mangroves form a complete ecosystem. That is, they provide a complete base for all the organisms within that environment to live and thrive. That keeps the balance in the larger environment of which humans are a vital part. Marshy and swampy tidal areas near seas and estuaries, where rivers empty into the sea, are ideal for mangrove forests.Mangrove forests act as nurseries for many marine species, they protect coastlines, and they regulate sea temperatures within their proximity.The prop roots have one function. They support the mangroves in the ever moving loose sand, as sea water flows over it.All types of aquatic life forms can be seen in these mangroves — turtles, crabs, shrimps, lobsters, prawns, fish, storks, egrets and cranes, among others. Algae, which is the green scum on the water, is a source of food for many fish.Underwater image of a mangrove-forest: the Importance of the Mangrove ForestThe mangrove belt is very important to humans. For, like the coconut, cashew and casuarina trees, it provides protection to the coastline from the rough seawaters and prevents soil erosion. During a cyclone or tidal wave, a mangrove belt faces the fury of wind and water and minimises the destruction on the coastline. The tidal forest is a rich source of biomass (organic matter that is used to produce energy).A mangrove tree in waterBut, not surprisingly, this rich aquatic ecosystem is under threat from humans. Land is being reclaimed from the sea for industrial and commercial purposes. Increase in shrimp farming has led to a decline in mangrove forests. Laws have been enacted to protect these forests, but the plunder continues.",

    "article": "Imagine a forest where the trees touch the sky. Due to enough rainfall, the trees grow huge and spread wide. Their tallest branches are so thick-leafed that they create a thick curtain. Even the wind does not find enough space to blow as it pleases. All there is in that forest is stillness. And it is very warm. The temperature could vary between 20 and 35 degrees centigrade. The climate is such that it is good for life forms of all kinds — from trees to animals, birds and insects.These forests are called tropical rainforests. Most of them are located near the equator, in Asia, Africa and South America. The rainforests of the Amazon basin in South America is one of the lushest rainforests in the world. You will find more varieties of trees or animal life here than anywhere else in the world.The rains are frequent and heavy — as much as 100 inches at one time. Thunderstorms occur every three or four days. Because of abundant rain, the trees grow to a height of almost 40 metres. There are trees at lower heights as well. The shade from all these trees almost blocks out the sunlight. Which is why you will never find smaller plants or shrubs in a rainforest. Smaller plants can be seen only where there are open spaces or clearings in the forest.The rainforests of the Amazon basin in South America is one of the lushest rainforest in the world.What you can see in abundance in these rainforests are animals, birds and insects of many kinds — and they all have special characteristics. Some are brightly coloured, some are incredibly noisy, while others are big. Leopards, snakes, crocodiles, anteaters, big lizards are some of the animals found in tropical rainforests.There are also the army ants that gobble up anything that stands on their way! Mosquitoes, sweat bees and even the common housefly have had their homes in these forests for long.The tropical rainforests are called the green lungs of the planet, and with good reason. They absorb carbon dioxide from around them to process their food and release oxygen into the air. That oxygen gives us life. They also contain the maximum number of trees with medicinal value.But now human beings are out to harm the rainforests. Many companies all over the world, especially in the West, have been attacking these rainforests for a variety of reasons — some want to make profit by cutting down trees and selling timber; others are trying to be the only ones to make profit out of medicinal plants.A river runs through a beautiful rainforestPeople who have protested against these actions have also been killed. One such person was a Brazilian called Chico Mendes who fought these companies all his life and tried to protect the rainforests. But he was killed some years ago.To the outside world, the rainforest has always seemed a very dangerous place. Generations of films and literature have shown the people who live in the rainforests as dangerous and violent people who have a strange way of life.But actually, these people have a better understanding of their relationship with their environment than modern man has. Greed for profit by destroying the planet’s resources is a unique quality of societies that have become modern and use sophisticated technology. One should then ask, who is more violent?",

    "article": "For thousands of years, the neem tree has been a familiar friend to the people of India. A native of India and Burma, every part of this tree, from its root to bark, leaves and seed, has been used for medicinal purposes. It has been used to cure illnesses. It has also been used for preventing infection, or repelling insects that attack grains or people, like mosquitoes.It is very interesting that the neem’s botanical name, Azadirachta indica, has come from a Persian description of the tree. They called the neem azad darakht-i-Hindil, which literally meant “the free tree of India”.Neem’s botanical name, Azadirachta indica, has come from a Persian description of the tree, literally meaningThe story of neem took an interesting twist some years ago. Some time ago, an American company announced that it had made a fungicide out of neem seeds. A fungicide has the power to destroy fungus that infects plants and destroys them.The company then decided that it wanted to be the only company to make this product. So it applied for a patent. A patent is an official document which recognises that a person or company has indeed created or invented a new product. Thus the person or company has the sole right to make and sell that product.It was very strange. An American company was trying to make sure that the “free tree” became its slave. The company filed an application for a patent on the neem fungicide at the European Patent Office at Munich in Germany.It took some time for the government of India to get into action. And then, scientists started collecting proof of the fact that Indians have used neem seeds as a fungicide for thousands of years. And this knowledge has been available for anyone and everyone.The case took a long time. The good news came last week and the newspapers wrote about it on their front pages. The European Patent Office had rejected the claim of the American company that it had created a new fungicide from new seeds.The four-member panel of judges also had a name for the action of the US company. They called it bio-piracy. What it meant was that the company had tried to steal people’s knowledge of plants for its own profit by pretending that it was the company’s own creation.In the countries of Asia and Africa, people still have a very valuable collection of knowledge about trees and plants and their medicinal qualities. Most of the forests that have these trees are also to be found in these continents. This knowledge has been passed down from generation to generation. And its benefits have been shared by all.Medicinal pills made of neem. In the countries of Asia and Africa, people still have a very valuable collection of knowledge about trees and plants and their medicinal qualities.For some time now, Western countries have been wanting to make full use of this knowledge for their own profit. And they have been trying to get patents by claiming that they have made something new!In that sense, India’s victory is great news for us.",

    "title": "The Plastic Menace",
    "article": "Heavy rains lashed Mumbai city a few months ago, the worst rains in decades. The downpour literally brought the city to a standstill. And all because of discarded plastic bags. Plastic bags or polythene bags are essentially made of petro-chemicals.These bags are very thin and in a strong wind can fly away from garbage bins and land on drains and rain-water channels. The bags then clog the drains as they do not let water to flow through.The choked gutters and drains in Mumbai caused serious water logging and flooding. Fortunately the rain and the flooding did have a positive aspect – it made the Mayor of Mumbai sit up and take notice of the plastic bag menace in the city.An immediate ban on thin plastic bags was declared. The ban came into effect on August 15, India’s Independence Day. The Mumbai Municipal Corporation workers were called in to help enforce the ban. They were told to seize bags that do not conform to the standards (all bags thinner than 20 microns or 2 x 10-5 metre thickness).The squads were given power to fine defaulters a sum of up to Rs 2,000 ($1 equals Rs 46). Within the first two days itself they seized 8,000 kg of plastic bags and recovered Rs 1.5 million in fines.Plastic bags are non-biodegradable, that is, they take years to disintegrate and decompose. Many animals, like cows and pigs, die as they unknowingly swallow these bags while eating. Coloured plastic bags are even more dangerous. Chemical dyes like cadmium and lead are used to colour these bags and the chemicals affect the kidneys or our bones.Plastic waiting to be recycledBut why ban only thin polythene bags. Why not all plastic bags? The fact is most shopkeepers use thin plastic bags. Thick plastic bags are very expensive and cost four times more than the thin variety. Thin bags are of very poor quality and can rarely be reused. As a result, these flimsy bags land up in drains and gutters.Of course thicker plastic bags are unsafe too, but at least they can be recycled. Many shopkeepers say they cannot afford thick plastic bags. Paper packets, which are the only alternative, are just not strong enough.Some Indian companies have now come forward with a proposal to make paper bags that are laminated with a thin sheet of plastic that is environmental friendly. They claim that this bio-plastic, made of natural products, decomposes within a month.But scientists say that these bio-plastics are not completely degradable. They are usually a combination of 50% natural material (that decomposes easily) and 50% non-degradable chemicals. So only half the sheet actually disintegrates within a month.The fight against plastic bags continues and the only way we can do our bit is by refusing to accept plastic bags. So try and take a jute (or cloth) bag the next time you go to the market.",

    "article": "It seems the fish were always a smart lot. Only, humans took some time to realise the fact. Some years ago, scientists had discovered that they identify family members with their smell. Now, scientists in Glasgow University, have discovered something new, according to a report in the journal ‘New Scientist’. They have discovered that the salmon fish go a step further. They actually keep a nose out for fish that smell like outsiders and not like family. Then they get tough with them.The reason may be that they use smell to mark out their territory, the scientists feel. And so, when they get a very strong smell of outsiders, they feel threatened.The Scent of an EnemyHow did the scientists discover this? They brought up 44 salmon from two different families and kept them in several water tanks. All the water tanks had members of both families. In some tanks, water was let in and let out. In other tanks they kept circulating the same water. When that happened the fish scents also got stronger. For water gathers more and more of the scent with time.The results were very interesting. In the tanks where water was let in and let out, the fish did not get very strong smells of family or outsiders. But in the tanks where the same water was circulated again and again, the fish scents were much stronger. The salmon in these tanks could easily distinguish the smell of family from outsiders. They got nasty, their fins became erect, they attacked and bit the latter.Scientists feel this discovery will help people who raise wild fisheries. For, now they know that if they put salmon belonging to the same family in a fast flowing stream, they will not develop very strong bonds. But if they put them in pools they will grow together and multiply.",

    "article": "It is one question that is not a quizmasters’ favourite: which is the tallest mountain on earth? The answer is bound to come fast and snappy – Mt Everest, at a height of 29,000 feet.But that is only on land. For, if you were to measure from the bottom of the ocean, the tallest mountain in the world will probably be Mauna Kea in Hawaii. It rises more than 15,748 feet under the sea and another 13,779 feet above it. The total comes to more than 29, 527 feet.There are such deep trenches in the deep sea that a mountain like Everest could disappear into them without a trace! (A trench is a long, narrow, steep depression in the ocean floor).The Secrets of the Ocean FloorBut, as US marine scientist Cindy Lee Dover points out in her eloquent book, ‘Deep Ocean Journeys: Discovering New Life at the Bottom of the Sea’ (1996), the seafloor is the “largest and least known wilderness on our planet. We know more about the surface of Mars and Venus and the back side of the moon than we know about the seafloor.”And that is a real tragedy, as she points out. For, there is reason to believe that every process that is taking place on the ocean floor tells us about the processes that were responsible for the shaping of the earth’s surface as we know. “If we are to understand the geological forces that shape our planet, we must understand the geological processes expressed by features on the seafloor, says Dover.The scientist has travelled to the depths of the ocean to explore the various kinds of complex creatures living in the deep waters near volcanic vents that could function as models for sites where life might have originated on earth.The statistics she gives are startling: that the lava produced by underwater volcanoes in a year is enough to cover an area four times the size of Alaska with one metre of lava! More than one million volcanoes occur in the Pacific Ocean Basin alone, but less than one per cent of these volcanoes have been studied and monitored. That means, less than one per cent of the planet’s seafloor has been mapped, explains Dover.That is why, most of the fauna belonging to the deepwaters are not familiar to even scientists. Many of them perhaps do not even have names. But the richness of these deep-sea ecosystems can rival that of the tropical rainforests.Some of the names given by scientists to freshly discovered animals are really funny, says Dover. Among them are the spaghetti worms, named as such because of their resemblance to the eatable. Found in a tangle, it is often difficult to make out where one ends and another begins! Just like spaghetti, one might add.At the time of the book’s publication, Dover was working as a visiting investigator at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, a pioneer in deep-sea research since the 60s.",

    "title": "The Smart Polluters",
    "article": "Health officials in Canada are very busy these days. They are placing chickens at fixed points all along their border with the United States of America. That’s an enormous distance of 2,500 km.It’s not a practical joke, nor have the Canadians gone mad. They are using these chickens to see if the deadly West Nile virus is lurking around. The virus infects birds, so they think that the chickens have a good chance of catching the virus. Or the virus will catch the chickens.The Canadians are worried because the West Nile virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. It killed seven people in New York last year.A chicken running scaredCountries around the world are realising something important. That it may just be possible to stop certain kinds of people from entering their land, but it is very difficult to try and stop viruses that travel from one end of the earth to another. When they travel to new places, they adjust very easily to those climates and sometimes start destroying the local plant and animal life. These biological polluters are called smart polluters.These smart polluters can be carried across borders of countries unknowingly. Just as we humans are travelling across the globe more often than earlier, these biological polluters have also started journeying much more. They travel in the ballast of tankers. They slither into aircraft through their wheels. They bore their way into objects that air travellers may be carrying from one country to another.There are some good examples of how these polluters work. The water hyacinth of South America is choking lakes in China and Africa. Tree snakes from Papua New Guinea are busy eating up bird varieties in the country of Guam, which is quite far away. Tiger mosquitoes from Asia are busy biting Americans.Suddenly, a lot of things become clearer. Like why the customs officials in many foreign countries prevent you from bringing in a small plant, or a decorative item made of wood that is in its natural form… They tell you that its in the rules.They have these rules because they know that these varieties of plants that are special to specific places have the power to spread new diseases among native plants and animals. They are called biological polluters and they always create problems in places where they do not belong. They could be special varieties of plants, bugs or even animals.",

    "title": "The Song of the Bird",
    "article": "The Song of the Bird []Humans speak when they are happy, they speak when they are sad. They speak when they are angry, and they speak when they see a thing of beauty. They try to speak even when they have toothaches, and often they speak even when they have nothing to say. Well, songbirds are quite the same.They sing to tell their winged neighbours and strangers that the branch on which they are sitting, or the shrub that grows next to the school, is THEIR home. Or they may sing to warn other birds that an enemy is near. During the mating season, male birds sing with great feeling because they want to attract female birds. All in all, the songs range from simple to a more complex range of sounds.The sparrow, the parrot, the thrush, the koel and even the crows, are songbirds. Nearly half the bird population in the world consists of songbirds. There are about 4,000 species of songbirds which are grouped under various families, ranging between 35 to 55. They are called passerine birds; in other words, perching birds. Many of these songbirds are birds that are kept in cages as you may have seen. Songbirds get their ability to sing because of a highly developed and powerful vocal organ, which is called the syrinx or the song box.Some of these birds can be very human. For example, some whistler birds cannot stand any hint of a challenge. Earlier, they would try to drown the sound of thunder with their shouts. These days they try to compete with the high-noise, high-flying aircraft.Ornithologists say they seem to practice their songs in some kind of schools with elders guiding them along.From the way they sing we might be tempted to think that these songbirds are bright and beautiful. But, no, these birds are often small, dull-coloured creatures. And they lead solitary lives on forest floors or open grassland. Looking at the dull appearance of the songbird, it is difficult to imagine that it could even sing!In fact, male birds with beautifully coloured feathers do not sing; their bright plumage is enough to attract the opposite, or to give a clear signal to other birds about its claim to home and territory. Similarly, there is a reason for the dull appearance of songbirds. It helps hide them from their enemies.The birdsongs are not always pleasing too. In fact, sometimes they are downright irritating. An American who studied the red-eyed vireo or preacher bird discovered that it made the same sound 22,197 times in a single day! As the well known Indian ornithologist Dr. Salim Ali has remarked, hearing the melodious sound of the koel can also prove hard on the ears!Usually it is the male who sings, but sometimes the female joins if only to strengthen the bond with her mate. Family is serious business for these birds.",

    "article": "Many of us wear glasses when we have problems with eyesight. But, have you ever heard of bears with glasses? No, not the bears who appear on the Cartoon Network on TV. Real bears.There is a kind of bear which lives in the forests of South America. It is called the ‘spectacled bear,’ or the Tremarctos Ornatus.It has white coloured fur around its eyes, which makes it look like it is wearing glasses. Some of these bears have only the bottom half of their glasses, whereas in some others the eye rings are so thick that they completely fill up the face.The spectacled bear is the smallest among bears. An adult will be about 64 cm high at its shoulders, 120 to 180 cm in length, with a 7 cm long tail. it weighs less than 135 kg and the colour of its hide varies from dark brown to black.Spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), also known as the Andean bear or Andean short-faced bear and locally as jukumari, ukumari or ukuku.The adult bear gives birth to one or two cubs at a time after a gestation period of eight to eight-and-a-half months.The bear is a master at climbing trees and feeds on nuts, fruits and leaves most of time. Sometimes, it may eat small animals like deer too.",

    "title": "The Straightened Leaning Tower of Pisa",
    "article": "You must have heard about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. In 1990, the tower was made off limits when engineers pointed out that the weight of people climbing the spiral steps could increase the inclination of the tower, and topple it eventually. After some 11 years of restoration work, a ‘straightened’ Leaning Tower was opened again to the public in November 2001.Why does the tower lean?The tower is actually the belfry (tower from which a bell is hung) of the Pisa Cathedral, which stands alongside. The construction of the cathedral began way back in 1064 and completed by the 12th centiry, while work on the tower began later in 1173 and was finally completed as late as the 14th century!The Straightened Leaning Tower of PisaFor a long time, it was believed that the tower’s original designer had wanted it to tilt. But, it was later found that the inclination was an accident. It happened because the soil underneath the tower is unstable.After the first three floors of the tower were built, work had to be stopped because the land underneath the tower began to sink.It was resumed some time later when the builders thought they could do something about the tilt. They tried to conceal the inclination by using longer pieces of stone on the sinking south side and shorter ones on the north. Five more floors were added, but that only added to the weight pushing down on the soil by several thousand tons and the building sank deeper into the soft ground.The restoration projectEngineers estimate that the tower has been shifting about one-twentieth of an inch every year. And, over time, the 180 feet tall tower (when measured from the top) has shifted more than 13 feet from the vertical. In the past, many attempts have been made to bring the tower to an upright position with unsuccessful results.The current restoration project, which started about 11 years ago, involved correcting the tilt by removing soil from under the tower’s northern side (i.e. the higher side).This exercise has reduced the slant by 16 inches and while the figure may seem minuscule, engineers are now satisfied that the building is safe. However, they point out that all their work may come to naught if there is an earthquake or a particularly vicious storm.",

    "title": "The Tiny World of Ants",
    "article": "It is believed that ants evolved from wasps and have lived in the Earth for at least 100 million years. It is said that at any one time there are at least 1 quadrillion living ants on the Earth.Ants are no doubt the most successful of all social insects of Hymenoptera, an order that also includes wasps and bees. Ants are colony makers and their colonies may contain from a few to 20 million individuals. The ant family contains more than 4,500 described species that can be found in tropical or temperate areas of the world.The hallmark of ants is their highly advanced social behaviour. All species of ants are social, while their cousins, some of the bees and many wasps, still lead single lives. Ant societies can have a million or more members, each rigidly programmed to behave in the best interests of its members. They are remarkably adaptive and are found almost anywhere.The colonies are female societies. The queen lays unfertilised or male eggs as needed. The sole job of the drones when they mature is to mate for a few moments with a young queen. When new males and queens emerge from a colony, they usually engage in a nuptial flight, during which fertilisation occurs. The male dies soon after the flight. The female drops to the ground, sheds her wings, and is adopted by an existing colony or buries herself in a cavity, where she founds a new colony.All worker ants are female. So basically the ant world is a mother and daughter universe.An ant colony resembles an extended family. Its members all have a common mother, the queen and often the same father, one of the drones with which the queen mated. And the members of an ant colony are even more closely bonded than a human family. The sisters in an ant colony share an average of 75 percent of their genes as compared to human siblings who share only 50 percent.The colony has one goal: to ensure the reproduction and survival of its common genes. The brood or eggs therefore becomes the nucleus of the colony. All the cooperative actions associated with ants – food gathering, colony defence, brood tending, nest construction – center on rearing the next generation.This demands not only cooperation but also sacrifice. The female worker ants sacrifice their own fertility because it is more efficient to help raise the eggs of a single, continually laying queen than to lay and rear their own eggs. Likewise soldier ants automatically risk their own lives to defend a territory needed to feed their colony’s brood.The colonies also show a division of labour. There are queens, drones, huntresses and brood-tending workers. The queen, who is usually winged, produce a large number of eggs which are fed and cared for by the workers. The other females who are wingless, non-reproductive workers perform the life-maintaining tasks of the colony. In some colonies there are subcastes among worker ants. The division here is correlated with size. Small workers tend the brood or larvae and the larger workers hunt for food. Guard ants at the entrance discriminate nestmates from strangers. They will defend the nest to death if invaded. The drones are produced from unfertilised eggs and serve only to fertilise the queen.The way ants communicate is also very interesting. Without voice or ear, an ant sends perhaps 50 messages through body language and pheromones. Ants are in fact little chemical factories, continuously producing an array of substances called pheromones, that serves as the ant’s language. Through these pheromones the ants can convey messages ranging from the location of food to the presence of danger. They use pheromones to orchestrate social behaviour as diverse as tending the young, grooming the queen, marking their territory, mating and laying trails. They also interact through oral exchange of food called trophallaxis, a behaviour pattern of critical importance to social organisation in ants.An ant’s life cycle includes egg, larva, pupa and adult.Whether an egg will develop into a worker or queen depends mainly on the amount and kind of food fed to the larvae.Ants usually live in nests excavated in the soil or wood or in a variety of natural cavities. Some ants called army ants form temporary nests that consist entirely of the ants themselves, suspended from one another and a supporting object. The nest is a living ball or cylinder of ants. In this cluster the queen and brood are enclosed. After nesting phase, the nomadic phase starts.The whole colony moves with the queen and the brood and are protected by the huge soldiers who will kill everything that come into their way. The African weaver ants make their nest of living leaves held in place by larval silk.Ants are generally omnivorous but some need special food. Fungus growing ants cut leaves and bring them to their nest to fertilise the fungus gardens they built. These ants are herbivorous and survive on fungus. In some species like the Atta or leaf cutter ants, the queen lays special non-fertilised eggs which will be consumed by the ants in the absence of food.The harvester ants frequently visit grass fields to harvest and store the grass seeds. They live in arid environments and survive almost totally on seeds. Specialised workers crack the seeds for the other ants to eat. Some ants like the gatherers or the herders feed on plant juices.Some ants are temporary or permanent parasites in colonies of other ant species. The Amazon ants attack other ants and bring back unconsumed brood to serve as slaves as soon as they’ve matured.",

    "title": "The Tree is an Invisible Heater",
    "article": "Have you ever noticed that bare winter tree in your garden, in the park or in school? Without leaves the tree looks so cold and dry, but surprise of surprises, it keeps the grass below warm. So much so that the tiny blades never get any frost on them.In contrast, grass in parks without trees to protect them are usually in white frosty disguise in winters. Why is that so?You would never believe it but that leafless tree acts like a heater to the grass below. It would not be so surprising if we knew that everything on this earth gives off heat or light energy in the form of waves.The energy of light travels in different kinds of waves in space. And while we can see some forms of light with our eyes, there are many other kinds, such as infra-red rays, ultraviolet rays or microwaves, that are not seen by the naked eye.A leafless tree acts as an invisible heater to the grass below.Whether we can see one kind of light and not another is dependent on two things – how many times does the wave rise and fall in a second, called frequency, and the distance between one rise and another, or one fall and another, or wavelength. The light, which we see, is made up of the colours of the rainbow. We cannot see infra-red rays because it has a bigger wavelength than the colour red and that is the light that the tree gives off.Just as the tree with its infra-red rays gives heat to the grass, the grass does the same thing to the tree, and they both remain warm in winter. But in wide open areas though the grass gives off infra-red rays, there are no trees to catch that heat and return it to the grass. So the grass catches a chill and gets frost all over it.Had the human eye been able to see the different kinds of light energy that a tree gives out, it would have always seemed like it was lit up for Christmas!",

    "title": "The Truth About Bats",
    "article": "Bats are among the world’s least appreciated and most endangered animals, thanks to centuries of myth and superstition. Contrary to common misconceptions, bats are not blind, they are not rodents and they won’t get tangled in your hair. The truth is that bats are mong the most gentle and beneficial animals on earth.A bat is a winged mammal with the ability to fly. It’s ability to maintain sustained flight, unique among mammals, results from the modification of hand-like forelimbs into wings. Bats are mammals just like humans which means all bats are warm blooded, have hair, bear young ones and nurse them.All bats can see but some use special sonar system called echolocation. These bats make high frequency calls either out of their mouths or noses and then listen for echoes to bounce from the objects in front of them. They’re able to form pictures in their brains by listening to the reflected sounds. In this way, bats are able to comfortably move around at night, avoiding predators, locating their food and capturing insects in total darkness.Bats belong to the order Chiroptera and are divided into two suborders: the Megachiroptera (megabats) and the Microchiroptera (microbats). Microbats detect their prey using echolocation while most megabats cannot echolocate but have highly developed eyesight.Starting out as insect eaters, there are now bats that live on fruit, fish, nectar, blood, rodents, frogs, and even other bats. With this great variability in their way of life, bats have become the second largest mammalian order and are now spread over most of globe.Nearly 70% of the 950 species of bats feed mainly on insects. Others eat fruit, nectar, and pollen; a few eat blood, fish, or other mammals. Fruit eaters or frugivorous bats living in tropical climates have very good eyesight and sense of smell for finding ripe fruit to eat. The nectar and pollen feeders are found in desert areas. Carnivorous bats living in India, Southeast Asia, Australia and South America, have sharp claws and teeth for catching small vertebrates like fish, birds, small mammals and reptiles. A few Latin American bats called vampire bats eat only blood.Vampire bats do not actually suck blood. They lap it up like a dog drinking water. They use their sharp, highly modified teeth to make a shallow wound and secrete an anticoagulant in their saliva to inhibit clotting of the blood. The vampire’s bite is painful but not usually dangerous, though the saliva may transmit certain diseases.Bats are nocturnal or active at twilight and hence natural enemies of night flying insects. A single bat can catch 200 mosquito-sized insects in one hour.Unlike other animals, a bat’s body is best adapted for hanging upside down. Bats actually have specialised tendons that cling to their roosts without expending any energy. Hanging upside down also provide bats with roosting space away from predators in safe places in trees and building that few other animals can use.Bats have low rates of reproduction. Most species produce one or two pups in a litter. Some species that hibernate have unusual reproductive cycles. Mating takes place in autumn, and the females store sperm in their reproductive tracts during winter. Ovulation and fertilisation occur in spring. The gestation period for most of these species is about 40-70 days and for some up to 100 days. In the vampire bat the gestation could be as much as 8 months.The new-born bats are large and are nursed from pectoral mammary glands by their mothers. Some young bats first fly at about the age of three weeks, a time when their milk teeth are replaced by permanent teeth.There is no place like home for bats. They spend half their lives in roost, where they rest, mate, tend their young, and hibernate. Bats have always lived in extraordinary places. Trees and caves are their favourite haunts, but they are also found in foliage, crevices in rocks, in spaces under the bark of trees, termite hills and cliffs. Some make tents out of the leaves, some roost in the hollow stems of bamboos. Species that roost in caves and trees often form huge colonies. Over the years bats have found alternative homes in buildings.However human activities are encroaching on bat’s space. Caves have been disturbed by mining and cave exploration activities. Trees are being cut and cleared. The loss of habitat has taken its toll on the nocturnal creatures. World-wide there are now fewer than 1,000 species.Mortality among bats is usually accidental or is associated with human activity. Some temperate species are remarkably long-lived; little brown bats have been recorded as living for 30 years, but 10 years is probably more common in that species.Bats are very beneficial to earth. Tropical bats are key elements in rain forest ecosystems, which rely on them to pollinate flowers and disperse seeds for countless bees and shrubs. Bat droppings in caves support whole ecosystems of unique organisms including bacteria useful in detoxifying wastes, improving detergents and producing antibiotics.Lesser known facts about batsVampire bats adopt orphans and have been known to risk their lives to share food with less fortunate roost-mates.Bumblebee bat is the world’s smallest mammal. It’s found in Thailand and weighs less than a penny.Giant flying foxes found in Indonesia have wingspans of nearly 6 feet. They are called flying foxes because their faces resemble those of little foxes.The tiny woolly bats of West Africa usurp the webs of colonial spidersThe Honduran white bat is pure white in colour and has yellow nose and ears. It cuts large leaves to make tents that protect its small colonies from jungle rains.Frog eating bats can identify edible frogs from poisonous frogs by merely listening to their mating calls.",

    "title": "The Truth about Zoos",
    "article": "Last week we carried a piece about the relevance of zoos as the last refuge of endangered species. But in India it appears that zoos should be the last place for animals of any sort, let alone the endangered variety.It is no secret that most Indian zoos are in a bad state. Although zoos claim to educate people and preserve species, Indian zoos do neither. Most zoo enclosures are quite small, and labels provide little information. Visitors are more interested in entertainment, often at the expense of the animals, than in educating themselves.The purpose of most zoos’ research is to find ways to breed and maintain more animals and to increase their numbers. Most of the animals housed in zoos are not endangered at all, nor are they being prepared for release into natural habitats!! The zoos are full of animals that are commonly seen – such as mongooses, peacocks, wolves and ducks.A group of wild animalsMaybe these animals should be released in the wild. There will be more space in the zoos for endangered animals then.So what purpose are the zoos serving? The entry for most zoos (including Mumbai’s Jijamata Udyan) is around Rs. 10/-, a mere pittance that is just not sufficient to maintain the area. Why can’t they charge more for a ticket?Research carried out by scientists show that animals are psychologically affected by the lack of space and the constant intrusion of people. The miserable living conditions in zoos and the lack of privacy often lead to animals indulging in abnormal behaviour known as ‘zoochosis’. They bang their heads against the wall, bite cage bars and even bite their own limbs!More than 60% of the animals in zoos have marks on their heads because of continuously banging their heads against the bar, says animal rights activist, Maneka Gandhi. An activist is a person who believes in direct action like mass demonstration, in support of a cause.India has 64 fairly large zoos and another 194 are medium sized zoos- and statistics show that in all these zoos some 10-15 percent animals die every year! Of course the deaths of endangered species gets mentioned in the newspapers, but deaths of monkeys, deer and other less prized animals often goes unnoticed.The other day, for instance, a visit to the Mumbai zoo (Jijamata Udyan in Byculla) came as a rude shock. Most of the animal cages are dismally small; the lioness can cover the length of her cage in three paces. Elephants are cruelly chained close to the main entrance; the hyena had a raw untreated gash on its leg, while the ducks were flapping helplessly in the dry pond. There was not a drop of water to be seen except for some stagnant water in the hippo trough.On top of all this hecklers abound, driving the animals to frenzy with their hoots and jeers. And the worst part is no one seems to care.The Supreme Court has finally woken up to the plight of caged animals and has ordered that no new zoos be built without the Court’s prior approval and anyone who fails to follow the order be severely punished. The Court was forced to intervene after the Central Zoo Authority, (authority set up by the government in 1992, under the Wildlife Protection Act), failed to improve the conditions of zoos.In order to raise much-needed funds and improve zoo conditions, three Andhra Pradesh zoos (The Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad and two other zoos at Vizag and Tirupati) have hit upon a unique adoption scheme. A big cat can be adopted for Rs 1 lakh while a whole lion safari could cost as much as Rs 20 lakhs.And for those of you who cannot afford the total amount, don’t lose heart. There is a scheme by which people can pay a small share of the total cost. The only catch is, you cannot take your pet home. Now if only the other zoos did something similar, at least then the existing caged animals will have a fighting chance.",

    "title": "The Vultures are Dying",
    "article": "What’s all this hullabaloo about ‘making connections’? You must wonder why Gobar Times harps on ‘making connections’. Another favourite mantra is – ‘be informed’. Such boring stuff, isn’t it? No tree-plantings, painting competitions, ‘queez’. No ‘Save the cuddly leopards’. Instead, we’re asking you to spare a thought for the bald, wrinkled, smelly vulture.The vultures of Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, till recently, numbered 2000. Now there are just four. Did I hear someone mutter, “Good riddance”? Good riddance it may seem, but chances of people following the vultures are pretty high. What can happen to vultures can happen to us.Experts have found traces of pesticides in the brain tissue of vultures and say that this may be the cause of their death. The food chain holds the key. Vultures eat animal carcasses infected with pesticides from the grain that forms the cattle-feed. Other birds or prey, like fishing eagles, also become victims as pesticides enter into the plankton in water, which are then eaten by fish which eagles eat. See, how the poison climbs steadily, a little higher at each level? Until it reaches the vultures. Or us. After all, we eat meat too. Vegetarians needn’t rejoice.Portrait of a VultureA government survey studied 108 samples of cereals, pulses, eggs, milk, meat and vegetables out of which 104 were found to contain pesticides, and 69 samples had pesticide levels above the allowable limit.Vultures also clean up a carcass in two hours flat. No smell, just sparkling dry bones remain. Without the vultures, your next trip to a wildlife sanctuary will be highlighted by SMELL!!Aldrin, DDT, dieldrin, chlordane – these fancy-named killers – have over the years led to the decline of the Californian condor, the American bald eagle, the grey partridge and the song thrush in England, and the South African blue crane. Realising how deadly they are, the U.S. and several European countries have banned the use of these pesticides, but countries like ours haven’t their lesson.What happens when pesticides like these are eaten by birds (if they don’t die first) is really weird. They lay deformed eggs with thin egg shells, and many of the young birds die really soon. Sometimes, because these chemicals jigger up the parents’ endocrine systems, the male baby birds become very feminine.So will this affect humans? Naturally, it will. Scientists in Canada, Sweden and the U.S. have found a very strong link between the use of pesticides and a certain type of cancer called Non Hodgkin’s Lymphomas.And wouldn’t you think that, babies at least would be safe from the clutch of these chemicals? Well, they’ve found pesticides in mother’s milk! Besides, 20 different brands of baby milk powder sold in the market were tested, and 90% of them showed that infants fed on them would absorb 90% more of the toxic chemical beta-HCH than was acceptable.So next time, someone you know starts shaving instead of putting on lipstick, don’t say we didn’t warn you![ Courtesy: Gobar Times, a children’s newspaper produced by the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.

    "title": "The Whale Hunt is On",
    "article": "Japan has sent out a fleet of ships on a two-month mission. Officials say that the expedition has a harmless aim: it is merely a survey to collect data on the Bryde, Sperm and Minke whales’ habitats, diet and migration patterns.But the environmentalists are up in arms against them. What has shocked them is the Japanese intent to catch and kill 160 whales. Both the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and the International Whaling Commission (IWC) are furious with Japan. They insist that the project is not a research study at all, and is merely a cover for commercial hunting.The Japanese, on the other hand, argue that Bryde and Sperm whale populations have increased over the past few years, and so hunting can resume. They also claim that they want to study the whales’ diet – but in order to look inside their stomachs, they have to kill the whales!A minke whaleJapanese officials says that while the whale meat would be sold in the local markets, the resulting profits would be used for further whale research!It is common knowledge that whale meat is sold for an astronomical price in Japan. So how is Japan’s whaling (commercial hunting of whales) scientific? How can they kill the creatures they are supposed to be ‘protecting’? These are some questions, which must be answered.If the Japanese are indeed carrying out a research expedition (as they claim), then they should find a way to do it without harming their subjects.Whaling (the commercial hunting of whales) has been going on for years now. As the activity increased and the population of whales began dwindling, the whaling nations of the world got together to form an organisation called the ‘International Whaling Commission’, in 1946.A sperm whale familyThe commission set down a number of rules that included a ban on the hunting of certain endangered species, while specifying certain areas for hunting purposes, and safeguarding young whales and mother whales.In 1986, Japan signed an international agreement to give up whaling. However, the country continued to hunt Minke whales, for what they claimed was ‘research’.This recent expedition is the first time Japan has openly declared it is targeting other whale species – including the endangered Sperm whale, the Bryde whale and the Minke whales.The Bryde whale is a grayish-coloured whale that can grow to a length of 46 ft. These whales are most common in coastal areas of most tropical and subtropical countries.The Minke whale is smaller and can be found virtually everywhere – although they are less common in the tropics. Most of the countries have given up whaling, but Norway and Japan argue since Minke whales are fairly abundant, they can be hunted.Both the Minke and the Bryde are not on the endangered list, but they are protected (as per an international agreement signed by whaling nations, in 1986.)Whales are not only the largest but also among the most intelligent of mammals. There are two main groups of whales – Baleen whales and Toothed whales.Both the Bryde and the Minke whales are Baleen whales, which means they are filter feeders. These mammals do not have teeth. Instead, thin plates of baleen (a fingernail-like material) hang from their upper jaws.These plates act as gigantic strainers, trapping the fish and releasing seawater. A Baleen whale swims with its mouth open, in order to engulf plankton and seawater by the tonne. It then shuts its mouth and presses its tongue against the baleen plates. This forces the water out of the mouth and traps the prey.Toothed whales are more numerous and are much smaller than Baleen whales. The Killer whale, found in the polar seas, is a toothed whale and is considered to be the most ferocious of all whales.If water enters a whale’s lungs, it drowns as any other air-breathing creature would. This is because a whale doesn’t have gills. It surfaces at regular intervals to take in air through nostrils that are situated at the top of its head.The largest mammal in the world, today, is the blue whale. This whale belongs to the Baleen category and can grow to a length of up to 100 feet (which would be more than 10 cars lined up bumper to bumper!).The Blue whale is larger than the largest ever brontosaurus fossil found — 75 ft in length. If countries like Japan are allowed to get away with their “research”, these marvelous creatures could soon become the next item on Earth’s “Extinct” list.",

    "title": "This One is For your Eyes Only",
    "article": "Any mention of the word ‘zari’ may remind you of the heavily embroidered Banaras silk sarees that your mother, sister or aunts may have. Embroidering silk sarees with zari, or golden and silver wrapping on silk threads, is an old and well known art in India.A sari with zari work is a dream come true for most Indian women.But if you mention zari to “eye doctor” or optometrist Dr Mohan Ram, he will probably remember a patient’s retina. For this optometrist from the LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, has pioneered a new, cheap and efficient method of testing the retina. No prizes for guessing what the replacement is – it’s the good old zari! A report on Dr Mohan Ram’s path breaking achievement was published in ‘The Hindu’ newspaper recently.Optometrists spend a large part of their daily routines looking into the eyes of patients. They do so to check whether the retina is working properly. How it is done is interesting: they throw a beam of light on the retina and measure the electrical signals that the retina sends to the brain. It sends the signal through the optic nerve. These signals are called electroretinograms or ERG. They are measured with a special instrument called the DTL electrode.There is nothing wrong with this procedure except for one thing. The DTL electrode costs are on the higher side. One metre of electrode fibre costs about Rs 2,500. This increased Dr L.S. Mohan Ram’s determination to find a cheaper and equally efficient method of measuring ERG.He succeeded, and in a spectacular way. Unlike the traditional zari, which was made of silk thread, the modern zari is made of nylon threads that are covered with some metallic wrapping such as gold, silver or copper. Thin and flexible, it is a good conductor of heat and electricity. It can also be easily sterilized.Dr Mohan Ram decided to check out the efficiency of zari on 14 normal sighted people. He measured the ERG of one eye with zari and the other eye with DTL. And the patterns of ERG obtained with zari compared favourably with the DTL patterns. Zari had another great advantage: it cost Rs 50 a metre and was easily available locally.The young optometrist has received a number of honours for his path-breaking achievement. At a meeting in Sydney, Australia, recently, the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV), spoke of Dr Mohan Ram’s innovation.Meanwhile, the optometrist is busy at work. He is working with research laboratories to introduce a particular standard in zari, so that it can be used without any problems.",

    "title": "Treaty on Global Warming",
    "article": "In the last week of July 2001, representatives from 178 countries met in Bonn, Germany, for something that is very crucial to their future and the very survival of our planet. They signed a historic agreement that promises to fight global warming. This is the first international treaty of its kind that seeks to check the excesses of human development at the cost of the environment – and the planet itself.Location and date marker for glacier in Jasper National Park in Canada. Clear evidence of global warming.The very fact that the treaty has been signed despite strong opposition by the United States, the world’s greatest polluter, represents a triumph of will. The feeling that it is now or never is what gave the decisive push toward the signing of the treaty.Global Warming: An artistic rendition of of a rapidly warming earthWhat is global warming?Global warming is exactly that: the warming up of the globe, that is of planet earth. This happens as the level of greenhouse gases like carbon-dioxide keeps increasing within the earth’s atmosphere instead of being released. Such gases are released into the atmosphere when coal and other fuels are burned to provide energy.Greenhouse gases are thus called as they act like the glass walls and ceilings of a greenhouse. So, while the sunlight warms up things, it doesn’t let the heat escape. Many scientists say that the earth’s rising temperatures could eventually melt polar ice caps and cause sea levels to rise, thus worsening the flood situation across the world.In 1997, a treaty regarding greenhouse emissions was developed in Kyoto, Japan. That treaty had limited the amount of harmful gases that countries could release into the atmosphere. But the main hindrance to the signing of the Kyoto Protocol was the opposition of the United States. Although the US represents only 4 per cent of the world’s population, it produces as much as about 25 per cent of the greenhouse gases.Like in 1997, this year too the United States refused to sign the agreement at Bonn. But the treaty was signed anyway. Michael Zammit Cutajar, the top United Nations (UN) official dealing with climate change expressed his jubilation, saying, “We made a tremendous political advance.” The next UN climate conference is scheduled to be held in Morocco in October.",

    "title": "Tree Rings tell many Tales",
    "article": "Examining ancient trees helps scientists get an amazing picture of Earth’s life, for trees are a record of their life time. By looking closely at the rings of a tree, scientists can not only tell how old it is; they can also tell you that in one summer in 1453 and again in 1601, there were freak cold spells.Tree rings, when radiocarbon-dated give a glimpse of certain aspects of prehistoric times. But what is radiocarbon dating?Scientists can use ‘dendrochronology’ or the study of tree time, to learn about past climates by studying the patterns of very old trees.Radiocarbon dating involves measuring the amount of carbon-14 that remains in a fossil. Carbon-14 is a naturally-occurring material found in the atmosphere. As plants and animals use the air, their tissues absorb some of the carbon-14.After they die, they no longer absorb the carbon-14 and their tissues start to decay. So, measuring the amount of carbon-14 in the fossil tells us about its age.Perhaps thousands of years from now, scientists will be able to carry out similar investigations on trees planted today and get some information on the state of pollution. They might claim with reasonable authority, that the amounts of lead in the air decreased as oil became a less common fuel.Right now, the oldest living tree in the world grows on the White mountains in California. About 4,600 years old, it is nicknamed ‘Methuselah’, after the ancestor of Noah who is said to have lived for 969 years. The age of the tree has been estimated by counting the number of its growth rings.Every growth season, a tree adds a new layer of wood to its trunk. Each ring has two parts – a wide, light part and a narrow, dark part. Tree rings provide clues about the climate, and evidence of disturbance around the tree such as fires and floods.The shape and width of the annual rings can differ from year to year due to varying growth conditions. In general, wide rings indicate good conditions for growth (plenty of nutrients, water and sunshine).Narrow rings often indicate less favourable conditions (drought, cold, insect damage, disease, competition and lack of nutrients). If a disturbance occurs after the growth season, it produces a narrow or misshapen ring the following year.Scientists can use ‘dendrochronology’ or the study of tree time, to learn about past climates by studying the patterns of very old trees. To look at a tree’s growth rings without harming the tree, scientists use a technique called coring.By drilling into the centre of the trunk with a hollow instrument, called an increment borer, they can remove a long, narrow cylinder of wood called a core sample. The growth rings appear as lines on the core sample.These interesting facts come from the ‘Woodpecker volume 2000’, an annual compilation on the state of the planet, published by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehradun, in north India.",

    "title": "Venice is Sinking",
    "article": "Most people all over the world travel by the road. In a city in Italy however, waterways make up the primary commuting routes. The city of Venice, rich in architectural marvels, is best known for its canals. Unfortunately, this beautiful city of flat-bottomed boats (Gondolas), churches and quaint cobbled streets is sinking and sinking fast.Venice is SinkingKnown as the ‘Queen of the Adriatic’, Venice is situated on 120 islands formed by canals in the lagoon between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers, at the northern extremity of the Adriatic Sea. And even the bits of firm ground have rather boggy foundations and all this is slowly getting eroded.Why is Venice sinking?The existing ground water table and the global climate changes that have raised sea levels by several inches, are proving disastrous for the city. As sea-ice melts and water levels rise, floods in Venice are getting from bad to worse. And buildings are already feeling the impact of this phenomenon, with their foundations literally being shaken. Take for example one of the most famous landmarks of Venice, the 900-year-old St. Mark’s Basilica, a famous cathedral that now leans slightly to the left because of its unstable foundation.Venice is SinkingExperts warn that the city may sink an additional eight inches in the next 50 years. Many scared residents have already started to move to drier regions in Italy’s mainland. To tackle the flood menace, a group of Venetians, called the New Venice Consortium, has come up with ‘Project Moses’ – a dam project named after the biblical figure, Moses. The idea is to place underwater gates at different points where the Adriatic Sea water enters the lagoon. When the water is low, the gates will remain open and as the water rises, the gates will close, preventing the seawater from flooding Venice. However, there’s a hitch to implementing this idea. Environmentalists point out that the gates would have to remain closed most of the time and seawater will not be able to move in and out of Venice. As a result, the lagoon water will become stagnant, harming the fish and plants that live there. Until a viable solution is found out, Venice, it seems, would continue to be plagued by floods. Truly, a case of being caught between the devil and the deep sea!",

Of that 3 per cent of fresh water, over 2 per cent is frozen in ice sheets and glaciers.

Well, 96 per cent of salt water is pure water. There is 3 per cent common salt in it. That makes it 99 per cent.

    "title": "What Happens After an Earthquake?",
    "article": "People often wonder whether an earthquake can drastically change the topography of a region. A few tremors and some buildings that collapse does not mean that the shape of the earth has changed, does it? However, earthquakes can and do change the topography of the region.An earthquake raised Rhodes island. The line of erosion (on the rock to the left) shows the sea level before the earthquake. The rise is uneven in different parts of the island, usually several meters. [Ввласенко / CC BY-SA]Ввласенко / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)Our earth is made of many layers just like an onion. We can divide it into four main layers: the inner or solid core, the outer or liquid core, mantle, and crust. The inner core is composed mostly of iron and is extremely hot. This heat causes the outer core to remain in a liquid or molten form.Most of the earth’s mass is in the mantle. But if pressure were to be applied on this layer, it deforms slowly. The crust is the thinnest layer and is rocky. It is also the coldest layer relatively. Because it is cold, the layer is also brittle and fractures easily during an earthquake.The crust is formed of huge rocky plates that are constantly moving at a speed of 10 centimetres per year. These are known as plate tectonics and they carry the continents or the ocean floor or sometimes both.While small quakes occur at depths of less than 80 kilometres from the earth’s surface, other major earthquakes occur at plate boundaries where the earth’s crust is being subducted (when a plate rides over another plate) into the earth’s mantle. These occur as deep as 750 kilometres below the surface.Most earthquakes take place along the boundary between the plates. Heat currents propel the plates and this movement causes the plates to grind and collide against each other.Since this is not a smooth process but is accompanied by friction and heat, tearing and shearing, the strain releases energy causing a fracture against the weak portions of the crust. This energy travels in waves along the surface of the earth causing what we term an earthquake.The earths’ crust below the ocean is quite fragile. The heat currents that propel the plates are also thought to suck down sections of the undersea crust. This produces huge trenches on oceans thousands of feet deep. The Mariana’s Trench in the Pacific Ocean is a result of undersea tremors.When the currents die away, the material forming the bottom of the trench rises, as it is lighter and sometimes unexpectedly forms mountain ranges or new islands to surface.An undersea earthquake can also cause flash floods or trigger a tsunami. A tsunami is an enormous sea wave measuring over 80 feet that travels at speeds of 500 kilometres per hour. If it does crash on land, it can cause devastating damage.A mosque is left standing amid the rubble in Banda Aceh, post 2004 tsunami. Several mosques survived and may have been saved by the open ground floor that is part of their design. The tsunami waves reached the middle of the second floor.On land surface too, earthquakes can change the terrain unexpectedly. The Himalayan mountain range was formed as a direct result of two continental plates colliding against each other. The great Tokyo earthquake in 1923, caused by the twisting of a section in Sagami Bay, lifted the Bay about three metres while shifting the Izu peninsula four metres to the west!The aftermath of an earthquake can result in large fissures on the grounds, creating gorges and valleys where none existed before. Earthquake vibrations can cause sandy soils to liquefy. Such a process would make the ground sink suddenly, in a process called fluidising.In a mountainous terrain, landslides may occur and sometimes, small hills disappear or are levelled to the ground.A major earthquake is also followed by smaller tremors like an echo. These are called aftershocks. Aftershocks are smaller tremors that occur in the same fault area where the original quake took place. As a general rule, aftershocks represent minor readjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped up at the time of the main shock.It is often asked if an earthquake in Toronto or Greece can trigger an earthquake in India. The answer is no, when you consider the distances involved. The earth’s rocky crust is not rigid enough to transfer such stress efficiently over thousands of miles.",

    "title": "What Is The Origin Of Silk Fabric?",
    "article": "My mother took out her favourite blue silk saree for the dinner party. I looked at it, mesmerised by its shimmer and lustre. The rich fabric draped around her body, making her look so very elegant. Definitely no other fabric can match the qualities of silk.But have you ever wondered, how silk fabric came into existence? Silk production, or ‘Sericulture’ as it is known, has a long history, unknown to most of us.What Is The Origin Of Silk Fabric?The silken rootsThe history of silk is shrouded in mystery. Some historians say that silk originated in China about 10,000 years ago. In China, however, legend has it that Empress Si Ling Chi of China was the first one to discover silk more than five thousand years ago. The story goes that while sitting under a mulberry tree in her palace garden, the Empress was having tea. A cocoon fell into her hot cup of tea from the branches of the mulberry tree. And as she watched, a strong white thread unraveled itself.That accidental process of unravelling the silkworm’s cocoon hasn’t changed much in the last thousands of years. Cocoons are still dipped in hot water to loosen the tightly woven filaments that make up a silkworm’s cocoon. These filaments, or fine threads, are unwound onto a spool. Each cocoon is made up of a filament between 600 and 900 meters long! Imagine that! You could take just one tiny cocoon and when you unravel its filament, you could wind it around your house more than eight times. Of course, these filaments are very very thin. Between five and eight of these super-fine filaments are twisted together to make one silk thread.By the 14th century BC, the production of silk gradually developed into an industry in China. In fact it became one of the principal elements of the Chinese economy. Silk was being used for musical instruments, fishing-lines, bowstrings, and even rag paper, the world’s first luxury paper.For more than two thousand years, the Chinese kept the secret of silk to themselves. It was one of the most zealously guarded secrets in history. Anyone found guilty of smuggling silkworm eggs, cocoons, or mulberry seeds was put to death. Silk became the cloth of emperors and royalty and a great source of wealth. Within the palace, the emperor used to adorn a robe of white silk while outside, he, his principal wife, and the heir to the throne wore yellow, the color of the earth.Common people were prohibited from wearing silk. Even the merchants trading silk were allowed to wear the exclusive fabric. Silk was stocked in warehouses for an emergency.The Chinese used silk in many ways. Civil servants were paid in quantities of silk, and it was a way for the rulers to reward their subjects. Silk was also used as currency in domestic as well as foreign trade. After all, barter trade was the most common way of trading. So Chinese traders exchanged their silk in return for spices and jewels bought in India.Gradually, people from different sections of society began wearing tunics of silk, and silk came into more general use.Letting the secret out of the silky bagIn 200 BC, that’s about 2200 years ago, a large number of people migrated from China and settled in Korea. They carried with them the secret of silk production. From then on, the secret of silk slowly travelled throughout Asia. It took about five hundred years for the knowledge of silk production to reach India. But once it did, India soon started trading silk with the Persians. However, in less than a hundred years, the Persians, too, had mastered the art of silk weaving, and started developing their own rich patterns and techniques.It was only as late as the 13th century AD, that Italy began silk production, with the introduction of 2000 skilled silk weavers from Persia. That’s only about 700 years ago, which isn’t very long considering that silk came to India one thousand years before that.Eventually, silk production became widespread in Europe, but the widespread production of silk hasn’t dented China’s image as the Silk Giant. Even today, five thousand years after the first cocoon fell into the Empress’ teacup, China is still the world’s largest producer of silk.",

    "title": "What Kind of Creatures are Sharks?",
    "article": "Sharks can be found in every ocean of the world. To many people, there’s only one kind of shark: the man-eating white shark of the movie Jaws. They think sharks are ruthless predators that attack anything they come across.Sharks are sometimes thought of as primitive creatures as they have been in existence for million of years. In fact, sharks are very intelligent. They have a fantastic sense of smell and hearing as well as good vision in low light conditions.Their sense of smell is so acute that they can detect a drop of blood dissolved in over one million gallons of water! And they can hear can detect a struggling fish over two kilometres away.Sharks do not have external ears. They detect sound with the help of their lateral line system which consists of hundreds of pores along the side of the shark’s body. These pores are highly sensitive to wave movements, pressure changes and vibrations in the water.There are approximately 350 species of sharks. All sharks are boneless fishes and their skeleton is made of cartilage or elastic tissue. Sharkskin has the same feel as sandpaper and can easily peel human skin off if rubbed against.Sharks have rows of triangular razor-sharp teeth that get renewed throughout their lives. As one tooth breaks off or wears out, another one rotates forward from the inside of the jaw to replace it.Predatory carnivores, sharks are rarely man-eaters. Except under unusual circumstances, sharks do not attack people. Most shark attacks are caused by humans getting too close to sharks, or if the shark is provoked and feels threatened.Only four species are considered dangerous: the great white, tiger shark, bull shark and the oceanic white-tip shark.Tiger Shark: Sometimes called ‘the garbage can of the sea’ because it is known to swallow almost anything that it encounters, including inedible manmade objectsThey come in all shapes and sizes. While the great white may reach 21 feet in length and weigh over 2,500 pounds, the largest, of course, is the whale shark at 60 feet. The smallest is the spined pygmy at 10 inches. Almost all the species have asymmetrical tails – the upper part is larger than the lower half.Whale Shark: The whale shark is found in tropical and warm oceans and lives in the open sea, with a lifespan of about 70 years.Some sharks lay egg-filled cases, while others give birth to live young ones. The gestation period varies with the species ranging from nine months to 20 months. Again, depending on the species, a female shark can produce two to 135 young at a single time.Sharks are the most misunderstood creatures in the world. They have an extremely useful role to play undersea. High up in the food chain, they help maintain the balance of the ecosystem by keeping it going.Unfortunately, sharks are commercially hunted. They are hunted for their oily livers, skin, teeth, flesh, or just killed because they are thought dangerous. This has not only endangered its life but has put the ocean food chain at risk.It is especially important for us humans to understand the nature of the problem. As social beings, we rule the planet and use its land, water and air resources pretty much as we please, with no thought for tomorrow.Hammerhead Shark: So named for the unusual structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into aBut, as biological beings, we are not the most important link in the food chain. We are a part of the huge food chain consisting of millions of creatures, ranging from the unseen microscopic ones to the big beasts.And any decision that we may take as the rulers of the planet may ultimately, boomerang on us.If the shark could speak, that is the message it would perhaps give us.",

    "title": "What Kind of Horses did Knights Ride?",
    "article": "In 1066 AD the Normans (people who came from Normandy in Europe) conquered England and introduced feudalism in England. Feudalism was a system of contract where society was divided into four classes: royalty, barons (noblemen) and bishops, knights (a title or a rank) and lastly peasants. Merchants and artisans were placed just above the peasants.From 1066 to about the 14th century, feudalism developed across Europe. There were no professional armies at that time like we have today. Every man who was called upon was expected to follow his king in battle. The king granted land to these knights. A knighthood was obtained either by birth into a noble family or through bravery in battle.Armored rider with lance on horseThe king gave these knights the right to fight on horseback. The knights were thus loyal to both the king and the noblemen.These knights of Europe displayed exceptional fighting skill with lance, sword or battle-axe and wore heavy armour to protect them. The armour also protected them from stones thrown by large catapults and arrows.The knight was an important fighter and had to know two basic skills: how to fight and how to ride a horse. A knights’ armour consisted of heavy steel plates to cover his body, a heavy helmet and a shirt of mail (finely intertwined metal rings set very close to each other). The knight also wore gloves, leggings and shoes of mail or metal.All this heavy weight could only be carried on a horse as the armour was too cumbersome for the knight to walk with. He actually needed another person called a squire (young men training to be a knight) and a page (a male servant) to guide him around as the helmet didn’t permit the knight to see very well.The horses that the knights used were very large and heavy, similar to draught horses of today, but highly trained and far from clumsy. These battle horses, wore a suit of armour too!A knight from his higher position on the horse, had an advantage over the foot soldier. So each knight, if he could afford it, kept several horses. He used a different horse for different occasions.During a jousting tournament (where knights displayed their skill in combat by fighting each other) the knight rode a horse called a charger that was heavy and strong. In hand-to-hand combat he used a lighter horse called a courser.When the knight was not fighting he used a horse called a palfrey, as did his lady and the squire.The knights trained their horses to do many things. Each manoeuvre the horse did was called by a different name. For instance, the knight could cause his horse to sink on its hind legs – a position called a levade – and remain immobile while he used a sword.From this position, the horse could rise and hop forward a step or two, a position called a courbette (from the French word meaning crow). It was also trained to stand on its hind legs and kick the enemy with its fore legs and this was called capriole.It was a miracle, how the knight maintained his seating through all this, while his steel armour encumbered him. The saddle was so built with high front and back seating that the knight could only fall sideways.However, if the knight did fall down, he could never get up and back on his horse without the help of another person!To identify themselves to their friends and enemy, the knights and his horses displayed a coat of arms (family badge) either on the shield, which the knight carried to ward off blows, or on the horse’s tunic.With the invention of gunpowder, the armour and knights disappeared to be replaced by light cavalry where soldiers carried muskets and pistols.",

    "article": "Have you ever wondered why hens don’t break their eggs when they sit on them? The secret lies in the shape of the egg. An egg is a great example of nature’s excellent skills in packing. If you squeeze the ends of an egg between the palms of your hands, it won’t break. However, if you squeeze it in the middle, it pops and creates a terrible mess.If you have seen the way eggs are sold in the market, you would have noticed that they are kept with their ends pointing up and are never left lying horizontally. Hens, too, incubate their eggs the same way, with the narrower end pointing upwards.What Makes the Egg Shell so Strong?For distorting or crushing an object, its shape is as important as the material it is made of. Although an eggshell is really fragile, its queer dome-shaped end makes it a ‘tough nut to crack’.The architectural connectionIf you have seen the Taj Mahal or any mosque, you would have noticed that the roof is a huge dome. In earlier architectural forms, buildings had huge horizontal roofs which had to be supported by a large number of pillars.The dome is, however, a curved structure – it has no angles and no corners – and it can enclose an enormous amount of space without the help of a single column.What the dome essentially does is that it distributes the weight and the pressure applied on the top evenly to the entire structure. In fact, in architecture, the dome is one of the strongest designs for it supports the weight of the roof evenly so that no single point on the dome supports the whole load and gives way under stress.Similarly, the dome shape of each end of the egg distributes all the weight evenly and minimises stress and strain.A simple experimentYou can actually test this with a simple experiment. Take two eggs and poke a tiny hole at the narrow end of each egg and pour out the contents. Then stick a thick tape around the middle of each egg and carefully cut through the tape with a small pair of sharp scissors. The tape will prevent the eggs from cracking and you will get four half eggshells of equal sizes with level bottoms.Place the four eggshells (cut side down) on a flat surface in a rectangular shape in such a way that the rectangle is slightly smaller than your books. Then lay a book on the eggshells. Then another. Do the shells crack?While adding the books, do make sure the eggshells do not move. If they get pushed around, they will crack. Continue till the egg shells crack. If you weigh the books you had placed on the shells to see how much weight the eggs could take, it will be much more than the average weight of a hen.",

    "title": "What Toothpaste did the Ancients Use?",
    "article": "One of my earliest childhood memories of Delhi is seeing morning walkers, milkmen, or shopkeepers chewing away at the neem stick, much like a cow chewing the cud. It seemed strange that they should go to all that effort when readymade toothpaste was available.Neem (Azadirachta indic a) twig still used as toothbrush in many parts of IndiaThe world was divided into four kinds of people: those who used toothpaste and brush, and they were the elite; those who used tooth powder for which the index finger doubled as the brush; people who used indigenous “monkey-brand” tooth powders and lastly, those who used neem sticks which were two-in-one.The last seemed the least sophisticated, even if it was the most effective, for Indians have been chewing on the neem stick for a couple of thousand years.Almost 5000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians had devised their formula for cleaning the teeth. It consisted of a mixture of powdered ashes of oxen hooves, pumice and a powdery mix of burnt eggshells. They probably used their fingers as toothbrushes.Around 2,500 years ago, it was the turn of the Chinese to talk about dental care, for tooth decay was as much a reality then as it is now and perhaps it was as necessary to smile and look good then as it is now.Persian manuscripts about a 1000 years ago, revealed a healthy level of awareness about the need to keep away from rough toothpowders. Some of the ingredients included animal parts dried and ground, herbs and minerals. These kept getting altered.For instance, about a couple of centuries ago, in England, chemists made very rough powders often using material harmful to the teeth such as earthenware and china. To make it taste good they mixed it with glycerine. For the foaming effect, they used borax powder.As recently as 140 years ago, little glass pots made an appearance in Britain in which the paste was packaged. It had a more solid look than the powdery mixtures of before.And one of the popular brands had a reference to the areca nut, popular in India! Flavouring was the name of the game, then and now, though now it is mint that rules the roost.In the 19th century, the toothpaste in a tube made its appearance as we know it today. And no prizes for guessing who manufactured it – you guessed it! The American company Colgate, was one of the first to squeeze dental creams out of the tube. Till 60 years ago, soap was an important ingredient of the paste, later replaced by other emulsifying agents.And of course everyone knows about the addition of fluoride to toothpaste that protects the tooth enamel against decay!But when did the toothbrush first appear on the scene? As is the case with so many ingenious ideas and inventions, the Chinese probably invented the toothbrush in its modern-day form about 500 years ago, by fixing animal bristles on a handle.Almost 200 years later, the toothbrush showed its bristles in Paris and a little while later, in England as well. The first ancestor of the nylon toothbrush, the one we use twice a day today, made its appearance in 1938, brought out by the American company Du Pont.And now? Choosing between a red, blue or striped toothpaste and a matching toothbrush seems to have become one of the most difficult decisions of our lives – fluoride or no fluoride.",

    "title": "What are Canal Locks?",
    "article": "In some rivers or canals the water is not too deep for large ocean-going ships. In such places large watertight compartments are built that help ships and boats go up or down different levels on rivers or canals. These are called canal locks.In certain areas, man-made canals are constructed to connect two water bodies. These canals are built to help cut down the distance a large ship would otherwise have to take to reach its destination. The canals are therefore constructed at a higher level, like the Panama Canal to prevent land on either side from getting flooded.The canal is divided into various levels according to its depth. The compartment or lock in which the ship enters is very large and rectangular with gates on each end. A ship that needs to go to a higher level enters the bottom or downstream gate. The gates are then closed.Once the ship enters the lock, water is pumped in by means of sluices (holes) in the gates. The water level in the compartment is then raised to that of the higher level and the upstream gate is opened for the ship to get out to the next level.At each level, water is pumped in or emptied to raise the ship to the next level. Currently, some large canals use pipes running the length of the level to give an equal discharge and to fill up the lock faster.Earlier these locks used to be manually operated but of late hydraulic power is used to operate these locks.The canal locks or watertight chambers vary in length from the smallest at 120 ft to the largest at 1,200 ft. They used to be made of timber or stone earlier but are gradually being replaced by concrete and steel.Among the well-known canals are the 40-mile long Panama Canal and the Suez Canal. The Panama Canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and separates North and South America. The Suez Canal in Egypt connects the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.",

    "title": "What are Dry Clouds?",
    "article": "It is that time of the year when all of us look to the sky, waiting for the first drops of rain to fall on our faces. We wish the monsoon would come soon. But for people who live in polluted cities like Delhi or Tokyo, there’s some bad news. Israeli scientists have discovered that air pollution may actually stop rain from falling.To know how pollution may prevent rain from falling, it is necessary to know how and when rain falls. The sun beats down on the earth and heats up the land and water.When the land and water have absorbed as much heat as they can, they throw the rest back, and that heats up the air. The air warms up and rises. It contains water vapour, or water in the form of gas.Clouds in a polluted cityAs the air rises, it becomes cooler. The water vapour hits particles of dust that are always present in the air. It condenses, or gets changed into a dense or thick form. It forms droplets. When these droplets become too big and heavy, they fall back to the earth as rain.Now, the smoke released by cars, trucks, buses, scooters and factories adds to the particles in the air around us. Because there are so many of these particles, many small droplets form, but they are not big enough to fall down as rain. These clouds are called dry clouds. Clouds that contain no rain.The Israeli scientists took many pictures of these dry clouds caused by air pollution. They showed water droplets half the size of those present in clean clouds.The only way to get back good rains is by cleaning up the environment. Factories and traffic must not release too much of smoke and trees must be planted wherever possible. Or, a time may come when clouds will form but no rain will fall.",

    "title": "What are Go-Go Boots?",
    "article": "Ever seen rock stars or movie stars strutting about in calf-length boots? Well, these calf-length boots were the rage at one point of time. Discotheques at Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York saw young women dressed in thigh high skirts to show off these boots called Go-Go boots.The Go-Go boots had its origin with the original ankle-length boots with pointed toes and inch-high heels worn by Cowboys in the American mid-West.Cowboys needed these boots for riding, and to ensure they don’t bitten by scorpions or snakes when they were walking on the desert undergrowth. The heels also gave them a grip from being dragged along when they lassoed a cow or calf for branding (leaving a mark of the owner on the skin of the cattle) or during cattle drives.By the late 1940s and 1950s, the boots became a rage with city-bred youngsters to give a macho “tough guy” image. At the height of teenage fashion people could be seen dressed in T-shirts with cigarettes packs rolled into sleeves, leather jackets and steel-tipped soles on their boots.Steel clips or horseshoes were fastened with copper rivets on the soles of these shoes to cause a tapping effect when they walked. These tap shoes were usually black and the swagger and metal tap on school halls added to the tough guy image.Shelf full of cowboy bootsThis style faded out by the mid-1960s at the height of the flower-power hippy culture. Ankle-length boots rose to calf-high and later knee high boots when Go-Go boots became a fashion statement.Go-Go boots were first introduced in the 1960s by French fashion designer Andre Coureges. That year, his collection featured all-white attire that included dresses that ended three inches above the knee and white mid-calf boots, called “kid boots”. When people started attending discos wearing it and dancing the night away it became the “Go-Go” boots.In 1965, Nancy Sinatra wore those boots and recorded a song These Boots Are Made for Walking that became a smash hit topping the US and Billboard charts. The record sold 4 million copies and the boots made history. And Nancy Sinatra became the poster icon for the Go-Go boots.However, two years later Go-Go boots too fell out of fashion though they were occasionally worn by rock stars and stage performers.During the same period platform shoes were introduced as they were nearly as high as a platform or sidewalk of the road. Also referred to as “the Elevated Orthopedic Nightmare,” these shoes had broad heels and broad toes uniformly two or three inches high. Walking on this required great dexterity and at its peak there were many casualties to this fashionable boots.However, these shoes found a ready buyer among people conscious of their short stature. Orthopaedics (doctors who specialize in bone treatment) began to have a field day with hundreds of people being wheeled in every day with twisted or broken ankles after tripping off these high shoes.Thankfully the platform nightmare disappeared for some decades but made a fresh comeback in the 1990s. Singers like Elton John and rock groups, and other fashion leaders, introduced this fashion once again.Over the decade, platform boots gave way to platform sandals. Today, it is very fashionable to wear platform-high slip-ons or sandals and totter about, all the while praying that you will not trip and twist or break your ankle.",

    "title": "What are Komodo Dragons?",
    "article": "European mythology abounds in stories of knights in shining armour battling fearsome dragons. Fairytale storybooks are peppered with illustrations of these huge monsters looking like crocodiles with wings and huge claws and breathing fire. Of course fire breathing dragons do not exist, but there is a tiny island, called Komodo, in Indonesia, that is home to dragons – yes, real dragons!Unlike the dragons of yore, the Komodo dragon does not possess a fiery breath, nor can it trample hapless humans underfoot, but it does pack a mean bite. This ‘dragon’ has a forked tongue that constantly flicks in and out (just like that of a snake). And just like a snake, when provoked the Komodo dragon does administer a lethal bite.The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres (10 ft) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms (150 lb).The Komodo’s mouth contains toxic bacteria that fester on wounds. So once the lizard bites, the bacteria (from the lizard’s mouth) do not let the wound heal; and the victim dies within a few days. In addition to its deadly bite, a Komodo also has extremely stubby and powerful legs and its tail can deliver a crushing blow to an opponent.The Komodo dragon is known as the Ora in Indonesia. Oras are good swimmers and the Indonesians also call them water crocodiles as they are excellent swimmers! More than 10,000 years ago, oras were also found in Australia. These Australian dragons (known as Megalania) were far larger than the present day Komodo dragon! In fact a megalania was twice as long as a Komodo dragon and at least five times heavier.Komodo dragons are also found in fewer numbers on two other Indonesian islands – Flores and Rinca. This unusual animal was discovered during the First World War (1914 -1918) when a plane crashed in the Indonesian waters. The pilot survived and swam to a nearby island. Much to his horror, he discovered that giant monsters inhabited the island. Luckily, he was able to radio home and was eventually rescued. When he first told his stories of the ‘giant lizards’ people scoffed at him.Komodo dragons may be very different from the dragons in fairytales, but they do enjoy the distinction of being the world’s largest lizards. They belong to the family of the oldest living lizards, known as monitors and are closely related to an ancient 33 feet long reptile, called the mosasaur that lived about 100 million years ago. While Komodo dragons are nowhere as large as their forefathers, they are known to weigh over 130 kilograms and grow up to 10 feet in length.Adult Komodo prey on goats, deer, young buffaloes, horses – and sometimes, even humans. This huge lizard is capable of gobbling prey up to 15 times its size and can eat as much as 80 percent of its weight in a single meal. A really hungry Komodo dragon has the ability to shift its jaws to swallow food larger than its head. These lizards are also cannibals – that is, they are known to eat other Komodo dragons, including babies and eggs.Female Komodo dragons lay eggs in underground burrows and these eggs hatch after an eight-month incubation period. Parents are not bothered about their offspring; as a result baby dragons are forced to fend for themselves. Newly hatched baby Komodo dragons immediately scurry off to sheltering trees and they spend the initial part of their lives trying to avoid predatory adults!Did you know that the smallest lizard in the world is the Sphaerodactylus parthenopion, measuring 0.70 inches and found only in Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands!",

    "article": "Everbody has used this product at some time or other in some form or other. Sometimes it is used to clean the wax from your ears, and sometimes to clean dust from delicate instruments. Many kick themselves for not patenting it when they knew about it.So what are Q-Tips? It is such a simple silly thingummy – a piece of thick plastic or cardboard with cotton wrapped at each end! Q-Tips are today, a registered trademark of Chesebrough-Ponds, Inc, USA. However, it was invented in 1920 by a Polish-born American, Leo Gerstenzang.Legend has it that Leo saw his wife using cotton wrapped around a toothpick to clean their baby’s ears like a swab. Leo was amazed and angry at his wife for he felt that a small error on her part could pierce the baby’s ear or worse, make the child deaf!Leo then decided to make a ready-made cotton swab, instead of a makeshift one like a toothpick that could be used to perform the same task without any fear or injury or risk.Though it was a simple concept, it took him several years to work the irregularities out. Since safety was his first concern, he had to discount wood splints. It stood the risk of splintering and breaking, or poking.Next Gerstenzang had a problem with the cotton swab. He wanted cotton on either end of the cotton “ball”. He also needed to get an equal amount on both ends of the swab and to design a way to keep it from falling off or little bits of fluff sticking in the ear.He worked on his concept for many years. At this point, he named his company the Leo Gerstenzang Infant Novelty Company to market his new creation.Now he had to think of what to name his product. He came up with various ideas and names. At last he chose the name Baby Gays.However, he found that Baby Gays was not a marketable name and in 1926, he changed the name to Q-Tips Baby Gays.But what did the Q in Q-Tips stand for? Q stood for “Quality”. Later, the word Baby Gays part was dropped altogether and thus Q-Tips was born.Q-Tips is today made from thick cardboard with two small cotton swabs at the end. Though doctors, even today warn people from insert these things in the ear to clean the wax it is surely a better device than inserting a pencil, toothpick, safety pin or any of the hundreds of other things people insert in their ear to remove the wax!",

    "title": "What are Truffles?",
    "article": "Every year, between November and March, people in southern France and Italy are busy trampling the woods, sniffing the air and peering under the roots of elm and oak trees looking for truffles. Truffles? Hey, its no trifling matter – there are organisations in France and Italy which let you take part in truffle hunts!Truffles are a rare and delicate type of edible mushrooms that look like little potato nuggets. They grow in open woodlands in regions with a warm and moderate climate, on soil rich in calcium or limestone.Truffles are found under the ground at a depth of up to 30 cm under roots of elm or oak trees. These mushrooms are a food delicacy known for their rich taste. Some people describe it as musky and fiery, while others compare it to a blend of garlic and pungent cheese.They are very expensive and in great demand.There are at least 32 kinds of truffles and are classified under the group Ascomycetes. Some truffles are the size of a pea while others are as big as an orange. Both Provence in southern France and Italy boast of the best truffle but according to experts, the very best come from the Perigord region in France.Truffles need a certain amount of rain and extensive exposure to the sun. They need to be cushioned in loose soil where they can feed off the roots of elm or oak trees with enough space in which to grow.It is difficult to locate them just by looking for them. Sometimes they occur near the surface of the earth but they crack as they reach full size. Even then only experienced gatherers can easily detect them. Truffle colonies also attract small yellow flies that can be seen hovering over them in the morning and evening.Although truffles are in great demand as a food item, it is difficult to cultivate truffles as a business. The ground is first dug over and oak acorns or elm seedlings planted. Soil from truffle areas is then spread about. It then takes fives years or so for truffles to appear. But it is profitable only after 8 or 10 years have passed. The yield is at its maximum from 15 to 25 years after initial planting.The truffle smell attracts small rodents to eat them and help spread the spores – a mushroom’s version of seeds – around the forest.This smell from the truffles is very appealing to female pigs or sows as it is similar to that emitted by a male pig. So truffle hunters often train sows to hunt for truffles. But once a sow turns up a truffle, it can be quite a struggle to persuade her to give up the find. To avoid the fight, some truffle hunters prefer trained dogs like poodles.Many ‘trufficulteurs’ as truffle hunters are called, have rights to several hectares of truffle territory spread out over the region. So for six months of the year the hunters and their dogs or pigs sniff, hike and dig their way to a nice profit.In case you join a truffle hunt and your shoes emit a smell, watch out for pigs. You will find it difficult to give up without a grunt!",

    "title": "What are Volcanic Tubeworms?",
    "article": "In order to raise chicks the farmer keeps the eggs warm and is careful not to crush them. But when scientists in the University of Southern California rear tubeworms, they keep the immature worms very cold and under high pressure.You would think the scientists are being cruel by subjecting these little worms to such extreme conditions. They are not.The worms can thrive only under these circumstances, because they live in the deep sea where it is very cold. They thrive on the sulphurous vents of volcanoes at a depth of 8,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean.Tube wormThe tubeworms, which resemble giant, spindly stalks of bamboo, live in clusters of millions, covering huge areas on the ocean floor. They have a thin, flexible, tube on their bodies made from secretions of a hard, mineral substance or from sand granules that provides them protection and support.The giant tubewormThey grow to enormous lengths; some have even been known to grow up to 10 feet in length. They have no eyes, mouths or intestines and are sustained by a scientific process known as chemosynthesis.They do not have food as we know it. They can just make do with some chemicals seeping out of volcanic vents on the sea floor. This process of using chemicals for their body’s needs is called chemosynthesis. But, not all tubeworms show such behaviour. Some kinds gather small bits of food from the water with their tentacles.The University of Southern California research team, headed by Professor Donal Manahan, is working towards finding out more about chemosynthesis, which is similar to photosynthesis. Instead of creating energy by absorbing sunlight, the worms absorb sulphur and other volcanic gases for their needs.The research team also wants to find out how giant tubeworms manage to colonise volcanic vents.A long lifeBelieve it or not, tubeworms are one of the longest living creatures in the world. Giant tubeworms living 1,700 feet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico have been around for more than 250 years. Although some species of turtles live even longer, these worms are the longest living invertebrates.Invertebrates are creatures who do not have a spinal cord. Of the thousands of animal species, which exist today, more than 95 per cent are invertebrates, ranging from corals and jellyfish to insects.How old are you, tubeworm?Finding out the age of a giant sea worm is not as easy as counting the rings of a tree. To determine the worms’ age, scientists travelled to the bottom of the sea in a submarine and used robotic arms to stain the tips of some tubes blue.Three months later, they returned and measured how much each worm had grown above the stain. They repeated this process every few months for four years. Once they had these measurements, they were able to calculate how long it would have taken for the worms to grow to their present lengths.",

    "title": "What are the Various Jazz Styles?",
    "article": "Jazz originated from the American South in the 18th century as a form of music sung by African slaves employed in the many plantations. Jazz music was influenced by different cultures from a combination of African folk music and rhythms to Caribbean and black American music.Various styles of playing evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries as musicians started to improvise. This was because early musicians did not have formal training in Western classical music and those that did began to introduce European harmonies and forms into Jazz and made the pattern of music uneven.Since, the most important element of jazz is improvisation (the ability to create new music spontaneously). Performers improvised by unexpectedly accenting at various places and dipping down where accents are stressed. This added just the right amount of excitement to make each show unique.In early 20th century, a band from Austin High School, Chicago, developed a unique type of musical arrangement that soon came to be known as ‘Chicago style’ jazz.Chicago musicians included trumpeters Jimmy McPartland and Muggsy Spanier; cornetist Bix Beiderbecke; clarinetists Frank Teschemacher, Pee Wee Russell, Benny Goodman; saxophonists Frankie Trumbauer and Bud Freeman; drummers Dave Tough, George Wettling, and Gene Krupa; and guitarist Eddie Condon.In New York City, James P. Johnson popularised a new musical style from Ragtime called stride piano in which the left hand plays alternating single notes and chords that move up and down the scale while the right hand plays solo melodies or accompanying rhythms. Many jazz pianists were greatly influenced by Johnson including Count Bassie, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller among others.Jazz was not only instrumental but had its vocalists too. Among the greatest jazz singers are Mildred Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Nat ‘King’ Cole (also a superb pianist). However, the various styles evolved mainly due to various bands that introduced different music in different decades.What are the Various Jazz Styles?The big band eraTill the 1920s, Jazz music was performed by solo players until 1923 when Fletcher Henderson organized a jazz band and classified them according to instruments like brass, reed, and percussion. Henderson went on to organise many such bands in the next two decades that included jazz hall of famers like Louis Armstrong, Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins.Louis Armstrong was the first male jazz singer who became popular and he also introduced a kind of singing called ‘scat’ that consisted of wordless syllables sung in the manner of an instrument playing. Armstrong’s recording between 1925 to 1928 rank among the masterpieces of jazz as does his duet performances with pianist Earl “Fatha” Hines.The swing eraBy mid 1930’s, Jazz moved to ‘swing’ and boogie woogie. The swing form was popularised by Duke Ellington. His recording of “It Don’t Mean a Thing If It Ain’t Got That Swing” got nearly everyone swinging to the rhythm of his music. While Swing emphasized four beats to the bar, boogie-woogie stressed on eight beats to the bar.In 1934, Benny Goodman popularised Swing through performances and radio recordings with his band and combos (combination of instruments). Benny soon became the ‘King of Swing’ and he was the first white bandleader to feature both black and white musicians together in public performances.Goodman is credited with other firsts in Jazz. He removed racial segregation and brought black musicians to the fore and in 1938 he and his band performed at Carnegie Hall in New York city, the first time Jazz had been played at a concert hall.Major bands of the swing era included those led by Benny Carter, Bob Crosby, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Earl Hines, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, among others. Boogie-woogie had Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, Meade Lux Lewis, and Pinetop Smith popularising its style.Count Basie immortalised Swing with his own distinctive jazz style adapted from blues that consisted of repeated simple melodies depending less on written arrangements thereby giving more room for rhythmic improvisations.BebopIn the 1940s performers experimented with chord patterns and melodies that came to be called hard Bop or Bebop or funky jazz. Subtle changes of harmony was displayed that required exceptional skill. Bebop took on elements from gospel and blues music blending it with rhythmic drive.Among the well-known Bebop bands was the Jazz Messengers led by drummer Art Blakey; Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, pianist Thelonious Monk, alto sax player Charlie Parker and drummer Max Roach.Bebop musicians played an intricate melody, followed with long periods of solo improvisation. In 1948, tenor saxophonist Stan Getz recorded a slow, romantic solo of Ralph Burns’ composition ‘Early Autumn’ with the Woody Herman band that influenced musicians like Miles Davis and Lee Konitz.Miles Davis’ recordings of these slow rendition numbers was soon christened as a new and better jazz form: that gave birth to the style and word ‘Cool’ to describe something exceptionally groovy.",

    "title": "What does SOS mean?",
    "article": "Recently, sailors on the nuclear submarine that sank in the Baltic Sea were isolated from rescue workers as their radio set got damaged. Luckily their radio operators knew the Morse code and were able to communicate by knocking on the sides of the ship.There are many explanations for what the words stand for: Save Our Souls; Save Our Ship; Send Our Succour… The meaning of all three is the same – it is a plea for help by someone in distress. That’s exactly what SOS is.It is a coded signal for help that continues to be used by ships, planes and stranded people around the world even 162 years after it was invented by the American Samuel Morse, who invented the first successful telegraph instrument in 1837. The Morse code, as it came to be called, is used to send messages through a telegraph line or the wireless.SOS is the easiest code to transmit and recognise. The code consists of three dots, three dashes and three dots . . . – – – . . . One can tap it on the telegraph or signal with a torch or even with a flag.Before the invention of the code, long distance communication consisted of lamp signals from hilltops, smoke signals and shouted messages. In 1787, M Lammond, a Frenchman invented the first telegraph line that could send messages over a distance by means of electricity. Morse developed the first successful telegraph instrument in 1837.Called a transmitter, the telegraph instrument converts a message into electrical signals. In 1838, Morse also developed a code that consisted of dots and dashes representing alphabets and numbers. These codes were easier to send over the telegraphic line. The dots and dashes travel across the wire and are picked up by a receiving set.The electric signals move a metal point to print these dots and dashes on a paper tape. The code can be used to read these dots and dashes and translate the message.In 1843, the United States Congress approved the first telegraph line from Baltimore in Maryland to Washington DC. In 1844, Morse sent the first message “What has God wrought” on this line using this code.Because of its simplicity the Morse Code continues to be used even as mobile wireless telephones are replacing telegraph transmission.",

    "title": "What does a Train Whistle tell us about the Universe?",
    "article": "I remember my first visit to the railway station as a child of five. The excitement of the approaching train was an experience I have never quite forgotten. At first I heard a train whistle far away, low and distant. As the train got closer, the sound of the whistle not only increased, it became shriller, and difficult to bear. So much so that I covered my ears in alarm!Once the excitement had passed, I discovered a secret – even with my eyes closed and by just hearing the whistle, I could tell whether a train was approaching or moving away.Doppler discovered that if any object giving out sound, is moving toward you, the frequency of the sound increases. That is why as the train gets closer, the sound of the whistle increases, it also became shriller.On a lazy day a couple of years later, as I threw a stone in a pond to see the ripples it created, an older cousin explained that voices or sounds of any kind, and even light, travelled in a similar manner – in waves.She named a scientist called Doppler, who discovered that if any object giving out sound and light, is moving toward you, the frequency of the sound or light waves increases. If it is moving away, the frequency of waves and thus, sound or light, decreases. The discovery was called the Doppler effect.Understanding the universe with Mr Doppler’s helpDoppler effect or Doppler shift is the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to its source.Then scientists tried to apply this phenomenon to the galaxies around our Milky Way, where the solar system is situated. They carefully measured the frequency of light coming from these galaxies and found the frequency of light decreasing, in the same way that I found the sound of the train whistle decreasing as it moved out of the station.This led the scientists to the thought that all the galaxies are speeding away from each other. So, if things are moving away from each other, they were surely together at one place at some point of time?The Big Bang and the expanding universeScientists claim that the entire universe was a small point in the past. A huge explosion called the ‘Big Bang’ created every known (and unknown) substance in the universe. The explosion caused the universe to expand. As the universe expanded it cooled down and created galaxies and stars. Slowly, planets were formed and among them, our solar system as well.So that was it! A simple phenomenon that we get to observe in our daily lives can actually hold the key to the biggest mysteries of the origin of the universe.",

    "title": "What is Artificial Intelligence?",
    "article": "If you touch a hot metal object, you will yank your hand away immediately. When this happens to you the first time, the sequence of events and the result (the burning of your hand) gets stored in your brain. This is what we call an experience.When you see a hot metal object next time, you will not touch it. You will use the knowledge of your previous experience and decide to not repeat it again.This process of learning, comparing a previous experience, making a decision and acting upon it is the key to human intelligence. We can make more and more complicated decisions by learning from our past experiences.What is Artificial Intelligence?Ever since machines were invented, scientists have dreamt of making them learn and perform intelligent tasks – like humans.Artificial intelligence is a branch of science which is into making machines think like humans. These machines, or computers, can store large amounts of information and process them accurately and at an amazing speed. What they lack is an ability to learn and make ‘intelligent decisions’.What do we need to make an intelligent machine? A memory or a space where experiences or information can be stored, a method of applying these experiences to new ones, comparing experiences to come to logical conclusions, like holding the hot object with a glove on. That would be an intelligent machine.Take your iron for example. The electric iron understands that its temperature is beyond what is required and automatically switches itself off.We could say that the electric iron is intelligent as it can react to a particular state (the iron being hot), make a decision based on it and switch itself off. However, since the iron has not learned this through experience, it is not a truly intelligent machine.Scientists are creating new software programs which try to recreate the process of human learning in a computer, in an attempt to make them ‘think’. These programs try to copy the functioning of the brain. One such program is called a neural network.A neural networkOur brain is composed of millions of densely packed cells called neurons. Each neuron is like a tiny individual switch in a net of billions of such neurons.Whenever a particular piece of information, like someone’s telephone number reaches your brain, it creates a pattern of on and off switches using these neurons.Let’s use an example to understand this phenomenon. We put up garlands of electric lights to decorate our houses during Diwali. These lights create various patterns and designs, one switch creates a series of circles, another switch a pattern of flowers and so on.A neural network is like these garlands of lights: a particular input creates a particular pattern. Each nerve cell or neuron in our brain acts like a light bulb. It creates a particular pattern on receiving an input.When we memorise someone’s telephone number, we actually create a pattern in our brain. And when we try to remember the same number, we simply try to recreate that pattern, unlike the lights which need to be switched on or off everytime that pattern needs to be created.A neural network is a copy of the brain’s functioning inside a computer, using a software program. It can be taught to recognise patterns.In fact, when it is trained, it can classify and identify patterns in a large amount of information. It can do all this at very high speeds and sometimes faster than humans.This throws open innumerable possibilities. Imagine computers, which can look at the past weather and climate data, match them with current conditions and tell us where it is going to rain and how much.Turing’s testIn 1950, famous mathematician Alan M. Turing devised a method of testing a computer’s intelligence. A person is kept inside a closed cell and asked to speak to a hidden human being and a computer.The person, who is also called the interrogator (one who questions), does not have any clue about who is the human being and who the machine. His task is to find out which of the two candidates is the computer, and which is the human by asking them questions.If the interrogator is unable to decide within a certain time, the machine is considered intelligent. However, there has been no machine till date which has been able to pass the Turing’s test. This remains one of the biggest challenges of modern day computing.Although computing sciences have made a lot of progress, passing the Turing’s test might be difficult for computers for some time to come.",

    "title": "What is Asthma?",
    "article": "Asthma is one of the most common diseases affecting the lungs. A serious disease, it affects all races and both sexes equally. This disease affects millions. Many of us recognize asthma symptoms like wheezing, chest tightness and gasping for breath. However, few of us know what is going on inside the body of a person with asthma.When we breathe, we inhale oxygen through the nose and mouth. The air passes down the trachea or windpipe through the two bronchi that branch off into the millions of tiny airways that make up the lungs. Here the inhaled oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is pulled out of the blood and sent back up the airway to be exhaled.The airways are surrounded by muscles, which are normally relaxed to help air flow. However, in a person with asthma, these airways are constricted. Since these airways are small and tight, they are perpetually inflamed becoming red, swollen and irritated.The body’s airways are highly sensitive to various factors. An asthma attack can be triggered by an allergic response to irritants or allergens like tobacco smoke, cold, pollen, cockroaches, horses, dust, feathers, or even by exercise, cold air and, sometimes, stress.When the airways encounter these factors, they trigger a response in the body. The muscles surrounding the airways constrict, producing a tight feeling in the chest. At the same time, the bronchii produce thick mucus called phlegm, which further clogs the airways.As air gets trapped in the constricted airways, the person is unable to fully inhale or exhale. The person wheezes and gasps for breath. During a mild attack, coughing or a slight tightness may be the only symptom. In a more severe attack, the person’s lips and nails might turn gray or blue due to a lack of oxygen.Asthma that is not well controlled can cause many problems. People miss work or school, go to the hospital, or even die because of their asthma. Asthma attacks usually last from half an hour to several hours. Prolonged or frequent attacks of asthma may prove harmful if the patient is weak or suffers from malnutrition. Some 35-40 percent of childhood asthma cases improve at puberty.A doctor identifies asthma by conducting skin tests for various allergies. Based on these tests, doctors prescribe drugs such as epinephrine or ephedrine in the initial stages. Serious asthma cases, however, may need to take corticosteroids. Sometimes oxygen may also become essential for such a patient.Most asthmatics use an inhaler or a bronchodilator that contains a medicine. These drugs mimic the effect of adrenaline on the airways and open them up. For those who prefer Ayurvedic medicine, there is cromolyn, which has little or no side effects. It is derived from the herb ammivisnaga. Homeopathy too approaches the treatment of asthma holistically, and many patients of asthma have found long-term relief through this method of treatment.Whatever method of treatment or relief one may opt for, asthma can be controlled but, as of now, this disease cannot be completely cured.",

    "title": "What is Blood Pressure?",
    "article": "The heart is a live pump that delivers blood to different parts of the body. Blood flows in or flows out when the heart contracts and expands. The blood is forced into the arteries, which expand to receive the oncoming blood. The force with which the blood moves through the arteries is knows as blood pressure.The arteries have a muscular lining which resists this pressure. The blood is thus squeezed out into smaller blood vessels. Maximum blood pressure coincides with the steady contraction of the heart, which pushes the blood into the arteries. This maximum pressure is called systolic pressure.Between heartbeats the heart expands to take on incoming blood from the lungs. At this point the pressure is minimum and this is called diastolic pressure. The amount of pressure depends upon the strength of the heart muscle, the amount of blood in the circulatory system and the condition of the arteries.To measure the blood pressure, a doctor or nurse uses an instrument in which a column of mercury rises or falls under the pressure. An inflatable pad is wrapped around the arm and air is pumped in using a rubber squeeze bulb. When the mercury rises to a level of 150 to 200 millimetres the pressure applied by the pad stops the blood flow into the lower arm. The air is released slowly.As the pressure is released, a stethoscope is kept on the artery to hear the pulse beat. When the pressure of the pad decreases to the same level as arterial pressure, the flow of blood starts. This flow of pulsing blood can be heard through the stethoscope. When the sound is heard through the stethoscope, pressure is at its maximum or systolic pressure.The device used to measure blood pressure is called sphygmomanometer or blood pressure meter.The sounds heard through the stethescope are called korotkoff sounds. When air is further deflated more blood flows through and the sound is magnified greatly. As the pressure inside the artery lessens so does the sound. The reading at which the sound stops entirely is the diastolic or minimum pressure.The average systolic pressure in a young man is about 120 mm of mercury and the diastolic pressure 80. These figures are usually stated as 120/80 or 120 over 80. Blood pressure rises with age as the arteries become more rigid. Sometimes stress, exercise or certain diseases may also cause the pressure to rise.Low blood pressure also occurs either due to heart attacks or loss of blood after an injury, etc. When the pressure becomes too low, the supply of oxygen to the brain reduces. Whenever a person has high or low blood pressure, she or he should consult a doctor immediately.",

    "title": "What is Cloning?",
    "article": "Which is the most famous sheep in the world? A sheep called Dolly. But why is Dolly famous?That is because unlike other sheep’s, Dolly was not born in the usual manner. She is actually a carbon copy of her mother, like an identical twin. This means that she is the twin sister of her mother who is older by six years and she does not have a father!Scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, UK, made history on 27th February 1997, when they successfully cloned a sheep. So what is cloning?We all have fathers and mothers, in fact all the animals we know of have them too. A clone, however, does not need to have both the parents.The miracle molecule: DNAOur bodies are made up of cells which have information to go about their work in the form of DNA or de-oxy-ribo-nucleic-acid. This is called the genetic code. Every organism gets half of this information from the father and the other half from the mother.We all have grown from a single cell which contains these two parts of the DNA. It is called the egg cell. It divides millions of times to give rise to the millions of cells which form our body.And each cell has a copy of all the genetic information needed by the body. This means that each cell of our body has enough information to create other human beings like us. All we need is an egg cell.In the process of cloning, the scientists extract the DNA from an animal cell and implant it into an egg cell taken from another animal. Before implanting it, the DNA of the recipient cell is removed.What is Cloning?This is how Dolly’s life began – from a single cell taken from the udder of her mother. The DNA in her mother’s cell was removed and transferred into the egg cell of another sheep. Five months later, Dolly was born and is now a healthy lamb, a clone of her mother (from whom her DNA was taken) – and without a biological father.It is technologically possible to clone humans as well. We might have clones of supermodels and great scientists. What if someone creates a clone of Hitler? Since it is possible, someone, somewhere must be attempting it already.However, all we are doing is tinkering with the natural world and its processes. As we have learnt from the story of the Jurassic Park, we might lose control over the situation after a point. Is there a disaster waiting to happen?",

    "title": "What is Cloud Seeding?",
    "article": "There was a time when a farmer would sit out in his field, watching a lonesome cloud float away, taking with it the last hope of a much-needed burst of rain. As humans take control over more and more natural processes – not necessarily for the betterment of civilisation – rain too seems to have finally been leashed in.Just like a farmer throws seeds on ploughed land to harvest plants, clouds can also be seeded with chemicals to induce rain! But to understand how cloud seeding works we must first learn some basic facts about the weather.Over 99 per cent of a cloud is air and air contains moisture. This moisture is the result of evaporation of water by the heat of the sun. When this warm air or water vapour rises from the earth’s surface and begins to cool, tiny droplets are formed and thus, clouds are made.For it to rain, temperatures inside the cloud need to be sub-zero, or below freezing point of water. When droplets of this super-cooled water meet specks of dust, salt or sand, they form small ice crystals (see image at the right). Water vapour in the cloud then freezes directly onto the surface of these crystals. When these crystals become too heavy to stay afloat, they fall as rain.Formation of such ice crystals takes a long time. Due to changes in climate, certain areas do not get adequate rain. Lack of rain dries up the land, causing drought. To avoid drought and to increase water resources, scientists have over the years studied cloud formations. They conclude that clouds lack ice nuclei. Therefore, they argue, additional ice nuclei should result in more rain-producing clouds.As an experiment, scientists sprayed a chemical called silver iodide or dry ice, onto a cloud formation. Sure enough, the chemical induced freezing of the water droplets, and what followed was rain. Silver iodide has a crystalline structure similar to that of ice and this increases ice crystal concentration.So the final recipe for rain is: one large cloud, though a bunch of smaller ones would do nicely too; a not too large serving of silver iodide (remember, too much and it’s called pollution) and the services of a plane. Shower the silver iodide onto the cloud. Blend well and serve cold. We now have rain!It’s important to plan things well. Since clouds don’t produce rain until 20 or 30 minutes after they have been seeded, one needs to make sure they deliver at the right place.The flow of air into the clouds and the liquid water content also suggests if a cloud is likely to produce rain.Cloud seeding is most commonly done out of airplanes. Planes fly into selected cloud formations and release packets of microscopic silver iodide particles using flares. When the particles meet cool moisture in the clouds, they trigger the formation of ice crystals and raindrops. The amount of silver iodide that is used is small enough to make sure that it doesn’t pose a pollution risk.Another method is to use smoke machines from the ground. The machines send silver iodide particles billowing from the ground into the atmosphere.So, the next time you feel like a rain dance, plan ahead. Make rain a part of the menu.",

But making this sugar ‘cottony’ is a bit tough. Let us take a closer look.What is Cotton Candy?How is cotton candy made?Look closely at how the candy_walla_ makes candy. First, he pours sugar into a small container set in the middle of a deep circular tray. Often, he adds a chemical called a colourant. This chemical is what gives colour to the candy (because sugar by itself is colourless).This small container (or holder) has incredibly teeny holes and contains an in-built heater that melts the sugar into a sticky liquid. The holder is connected to a small motor that causes it to rotate. As it spins incredibly fast, and liquid sugar splashes out of the tiny holes. As soon as the hot liquid hits the air, it cools, and solidifies, forming threads of sugar in the circular tray.The candy man then pops in a stick, deftly wraps these threads of candy around it and hands his creation to you!",

    "title": "What is Daylight Saving Time?",
    "article": "People in some parts of the world gain an extra hour in winters and are able to sleep and snore that much longer thanks to a suggestion by Benjamin Franklin about daylight saving time. But when the suggestion was first made, it raised such a furore not only from those kept awake by the extra snoring but also from others and they wasted a lot of time fighting over this extra hour.Actually the confusion began when the postal service and the railways began to connect far-flung cities. These towns followed their town clock by measuring the position of the sun. Therefore every city was on a slightly different time.In 1784, Benjamin Franklin, who was US ambassador to France then, suggested the daylight saving time concept but he was ignored. However, the railways decided to standardise time and Britain was the first to adapt a single consistent time across the country. But, this did nothing to ease international travel.In 1884, a Canadian railway engineer Sir Sanford Fleming suggested that the entire world be divided into time zones that would be calculated from a prime meridian. This would help calculate various time zones relative to that one.In October 1884, the International Meridian Conference met in Washington, DC and chose Greenwich, a village just outside London in England as the prime meridian. Though this Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT) was approved and adopted by the world, the various time zones across the world caused longer daylight hours in summer and shorter daylight hours in winter in certain countries.What is daylight saving time?So in 1907, a Londoner called William Willett tried to revive the subject of daylight savings time. Unfortunately he got laughed at. It was the practical Germans who realized that such a scheme helped reduce energy costs in lighting and electricity and immediately implemented it.But why would you want to save daylight time at all? Adopting the Daylight Saving Time (DST) scheme saves energy. Energy used and the demand for electricity for lighting our homes is directly connected to when we go to bed and when we get up.Studies show that sunrise in the summer is very early and most people wake up after the sun rises. Because the sun is up, we don’t need to turn on lights in our homes. Thus, we actually use less energy in the morning. The opposite works in winter.With DST, the ‘spring forward and fall (autumn) backward’ system comes into play. In summer, the clock is extended by an hour and the sun therefore ‘sets’ one hour later. This means that less electricity would be used for lighting and appliances later in the day. In autumn and winters, the clock is set an hour backward as more light is needed in the morning.However, there was opposition as people did not like the idea of getting up an hour early or going to bed an hour later, just to keep up with the Joneses in some far off village in Greenwich.Others complained of the inconvenience of changing all the clocks, and adjusting to a new sleeping schedule. For most people, this is a mere nuisance, but for some people with sleep disorders this transition is very difficult.But in 1916, a year after Willett died, Britain and USA adapted DST. Other countries followed suit. The motivation was to conserve coal during World War I. Clocks were put one hour ahead of GMT during the summer months. But in 1918 the law was repealed in the United States.Two decades later during World War II, DST was re-introduced to help the war effort and clocks were put two hours ahead of GMT during summer! This became known as Double Summer Time.From 1945 to 1962, DST became quite inconsistent with a hodgepodge of time observances and no agreement when to change clocks. Countries were free to observe or not observe DST. This caused confusion no end – especially for the broadcasting industry, for the postal service, railways and airlines.In 1966, the United States Congress introduced the Uniform Time Act to regulate DST across the country. Today, approximately 70 countries utilize DST. While Europe has been taking advantage of the time change for decades, in 1996 the European Union (or EU) standardized a EU-wide ‘summertime period’. The EU is the union of all European countries into one economic entity, though they differ politically.However, some countries like those in the equatorial and tropical regions do not observer DST as daylight hours are similar through the year and there is no advantage in moving clocks backward and forwards.",

Zamenhof, who grew up in Warsaw, Poland, was convinced that a common language would be necessary to resolve many problems as language barriers helped to aggravate problems between nations.Zamenhof realised that none of the major European languages, French, German, English, Spanish, Italian and Russian could be made universal as they were all difficult languages to learn. The difficulty in mastering grammar would put native speakers at an advantage with respect to those who did not speak them fluently.Hello in major languages around the world: None of the major European languages, French, German, English, Spanish, Italian and Russian could be made universalHe set to work, convinced that a universal international language easily learned and spoken by everyone, was the solution to such problems.In 1887, he published his first book Lingvo Internacia in Russian under a pseudonym (false name) Esperanto. This word Esperanto, in Esperanto meant ‘a person who is hoping’. Against all odds, the book became a bestseller and it was translated into English as Dr Esperanto’s International Language.Esperanto is a planned language. A planned language is a modern language developed by merging existing scripts or by coining new words and phrases from existing languages. While there are other planned languages like Bahasa Indonesia, the most well-known have been Volapuk, Esperanto and Ido.Esperanto: An artificial international language. Is it possible to have a universal language around the world?Esperanto is the easiest language to learn taking only one-fifth the time needed to learn any other language!In 1908, the language was adopted for use by the Universala Esperants-Asocio, established at Rotterdam. The University has members in 85 countries, and national and international associations are affiliated to it.Esperanto is a phonetic language with no irregularities in grammar. The roots of words have been taken from a number of national languages.In 1954, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organsiation (UNESCO) recognised the fact that Esperanto was developed to help improve relationships between various countries, people and culture and unite them globally.Today, Esperanto is spoken by over 10 million people and there are some people who use it as their mother tongue.

The ‘Old Faithful’, as one of the geysers in the Yellow Stone National Park in the United States of America is called, spews out boiling water at intervals of 33 to 120 minutes.Old Faithful, as one of the geysers in the Yellow Stone National Park in the USA is called, spews out boiling water at intervals of 33 to 120 minutesWhy do natural geysers spew hot water?Deep inside the earth, the rocks are in a super heated molten form called magma. Sometimes water that seeps into the earth, through cracks in the rocks, comes in contact with this molten magma. This results in the water getting super-heated.This hot water can reach temperatures of more than 302 degrees fahrenheit or 150 degrees celsius. That’s a lot hotter than boiling water, which boils at 212 degrees fahrenheit or 100 degrees celsius. As the water heats up, it rises up to the surface of the earth and spews out of the cracks. This is the geyser.The steam and water that geysers throw up often makes a spectacular sight as the discharge comes out with so much force that it sometimes rises as high as 500m.What is Geothermal Energy?Geothermal energy to electricityThis heat energy, hidden under the surface of the earth, is called geothermal energy. Now, scientists across the world are trying to tap this energy to generate electricity and feed power stations.In fact, in several areas of California in America, this hot steam or water is pumped from under the ground to a power plant where it is used to generate electricity. Forty-six of California’s 58 counties have some type of geothermal resource of energy.However, geothermal energy is difficult to handle. First, there are very few areas of such geothermal activity. Secondly, the areas where such activities occur are highly prone to earthquakes. Lastly, the chemicals that come out of the earth, as part of the steam, can be very harmful to the machines and equipment used to generate electricity.",

All modern means of communication – telephone, cellphone, wireless sets – lie dead as the cyclone has destroyed all connecting stations and links.This is what happened during the Orissa cyclone. All communication links broke down as dish antennas, radio stations, telephone lines, satellite links were destroyed.There was no way people could contact the outside world. This was when a bunch of amateurs, students and radio enthusiasts got together to set up something called an amateur radio or ham radio station.What is Ham Radio?What is a HamHam is another name for an amateur radio set. It is actually a simple radio transmitter and receiver which can be built and setup using simple and low cost equipment. The ham radio receives radio signals just like your home radio set.The only difference is that your home radio set receives signals only from a radio station. A ham radio receives signals from another ham radio. So, each ham radio is like a radio-station-cum-radio-receiver built into one. It is actually like operating a radio station from your home.What you can do with a ham radioOnce you have your ham radio set operational, you can simply tune into a channel (like the radio stations you tune into) and send and receive radio messages to all those who are currently on that channel. It is like an online chat except that it is on a radio set.With a ham radio, you can connect to other people using ham radios across the globe. Several astronauts carry ham radio sets on their space voyages. If you are lucky, you can actually contact them. You can also contact trekkers or even explorers.However, you have to write exams to get a ham radio license. This license enables you to setup and operate a ham radio station.

    "title": "What is Leukaemia?",
    "article": "Some 15 years back when I was still in school, our class teacher, Mrs. Khurana, would remain absent from school and class almost every other day. We kids were very happy without realising and neither did we bother to find out the reason for her absence.It was only later that our principal informed us that Mrs. Khurana’s only son was suffering from leukaemia (wrongly called blood cancer). I remember later that Mrs. Khurana took her son to abroad where he underwent a bone marrow transplant.All this happened years ago, when cancer was “the most dreaded disease”. I was under the impression that in this day and age most any disease was curable except of course for AIDS and that too doctors are working round the clock to find a cure.However, I found out that this disease could strike anyone anytime. Most people think that leukaemia is a form of cancer of the blood. This is not strictly true. Leukaemia is really a cancer of the bone marrow.The bone marrow is found in the cavities of the long bones, ribcage and pelvis and contains many different types of cells, which actually produce all the various types of blood cells. Blood, which nourishes our body is essential to life. There are many different substances like red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, etc in the blood, each with a job to do. There needs to be a certain number of cells of each in our blood.The bone marrow is the body’s blood making factory producing millions of red and white blood cells each and every day of our lives. If one of these bone marrow cells becomes cancerous, it gets out of control. These cells then push out all the normal blood making cells from the bone marrow. Consequently normal blood production stops and the bone marrow and blood begin to fill up with cancerous cells.Various bone marrow cells give rise to various types of blood cells and depending on which marrow cell goes out of control, a particular type of leukaemia affects the person.Electron Microscopy Photography of a group of human Neutrophils. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disorder of the process that normally produces neutrophils, a type of white blood cellBroadly speaking there are two main categories of leukaemia – acute and chronic. Acute leukaemia starts suddenly and progresses rapidly, sometimes even killing the patient in a matter of weeks if left untreated. Chronic leukaemia starts gradually and progresses slowly taking many months or even years.In acute leukaemia the lymphocytes (white blood cells) are affected. Lymphocytes produce antibodies, which are vital parts of the body’s immune system.Years ago, a person with leukaemia was considered really hopeless. Advances in modern drugs and treatments have led to enormous improvements in survival and cure rates. Today, almost two-thirds of children and about 30% of adults are cured through strong drugs and chemotherapy.A new form of treatment is bone marrow transplantation. Here the bone marrow cells from a donor, is transplanted into the bloodstream of the patient. The new healthy bone marrow cells find their way to the bone marrow cavity and start producing normal blood cells.Modern research is still working towards early detection of leukaemia and easier and faster cure for this disease.",

    "title": "What is Mad Cow Disease?",
    "article": "In 1996, doctors detected 10 cases of a rare and fatal human brain disease in Britain and they diagnosed that it was probably due to eating beef from animals with “mad cow disease”. Scientifically, this cow disease was termed bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE while the disease affecting humans was termed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).The disease caused panic in Europe both among people eating beef and the farmers who were selling it. The European Union, which is the administrative body and includes all countries in Europe, responded immediately by banning imports of British beef.Illustration of a ‘mad’ cowHowever, do cows go really mad with this disease? Scientists and doctors who have been studying BSE in cows decided that it is similar to a sheep disease called scrapie. Scrapie, which was discovered in the 1700s, is a fatal brain illness that can pass from one animal to another in a herd.Scrapie attacks the brain and causes it to look like a sponge, as if full of holes. Hence the term “spongiform”. The disease causes extreme itching. Animals scratch themselves madly against fences, posts or other rough objects.Their movements, too, become uncoordinated. Some become nervous and skittish while others become extremely aggressive. Inevitably, the animal dies. There is no treatment or cure nor even an explanation why or how this disease occurs.Doctors discovered that the disease was being transmitted to cows through their feed. The cows were being fed a protein supplement from sheep called offal. In 1989, the link between sheep offal and BSE was firmly established and the British government banned the use of sheep offal to cattle.However, many people were still not convinced that this was enough. They figured that if cows could became infected by eating sheep offal, couldn’t people suffer a similar fate after eating “mad cow” meat or milk?In 1993, the BSE epidemic reached a peak with over 1,000 cases detected per week. However, the British government continued to argue that the mad cow disease could not harm humans.By 1996, it was discovered that over 160,000 British cows have been diagnosed with BSE. Then 10 people died and it caused a furore all over the world.There was general panic over this contaminated meat. Hotels and restaurants in Britain faced a slump as people refused to eat steaks or have milk or cheese products. People refused to buy beef and the meat rotted at the butchers. The European Union imposed a ban on British beef causing a war of words between Britain and the European Union.Nobody wanted anything to do with British cows. Other countries imposed a ban too. The British government decided that the only way to prevent other uninfected cattle from catching the disease was to slaughter the diseased ones.The Cambodian government even suggested that they be used to detonate over 10 million land mines left over from the Cambodian civil war.Further scientific discoveries did nothing to ease the problem faced the British government. It was discovered that the CJE disease has a 30-year latency (time between infection and the appearance of disease).This meant that the disease could be hidden and not be discovered for years! Secondly the disease-causing agent was very resistant.Ultimately, the government decided to slaughter the cows. This required over 2.6 million heads of cattle to be killed in the United Kingdom. Special arrangements were made for farmers to get the cattle to the slaughterhouse. The government also had to compensate the farmers for loss of livelihood.In 1998, the European Union was satisfied that the threat from the mad cow disease was eradicated and lifted the ban.Today, mad cow disease is still present in British herds, but in very small numbers thanks to changes in feeding practices and strict medical watch over healthy and suspected cattle.",

    "title": "What is Memory?",
    "article": "As a child my day began with a LARGE glass of milk and five almonds with their skin pealed, that my mother used to put in a bowl of water the previous night. While the milk was for health and energy, the almonds were for increasing the memory. I don’t know how much they helped, but I still offer them to my children in the hope that they do. After all, memory is a precious thing.No person really knows how much he or she remembers. I once tried to play a game with myself. I closed my eye and tried to recall everything I had ever seen – all the people, all the houses, all the streets, all the objects that I had ever looked at, and all the words and numbers I had ever learned.There seemed to be no end to the list of things that I could think of, so much so that in the end of it I got bored of the whole thing. But all this left me wondering – how could I remember so much, even the things that happened a long long time ago? How is it possible that their images are still so clear in my mind?Our brain is like a large filing cabinet with lots and lots of drawers and files. Whatever we see, hear or read, is filed and stored in this large memory bank. Millions and millions of impressions are stored away neatly, much like a library stocks books in its shelves. In fact our brain is the largest and most well-organized filing system in the world.Whenever we want to recall something, the correct drawer and the correct file opens and whatever it is we want to recall is easily remembered. Till date though, no one has figured out how impressions are filed in the photographic library of our brain .Unfortunately, sometimes parts of these impressions get lost or destroyed due to an accident or shock. For example, a person who has had a heady injury or a hemorrhage within the skull may lose parts of his memory or even all of it. He may even forget how to speak but he can read and write!The condition is referred to as amnesia or “memory blindness”. Amnesia can be caused by high tension, pressure or under periods of extreme anxiety. Amnesiacs forget certain associations and cannot recall them even if they are everyday items or people.Sometimes a severe fright or trauma can cause the brain to block-off certain portions of the memory. Amnesia can be treated by psychologists or psychiatrists. We often see these cases in Hindi movies, where a person loses his memory and in the end recovers fully, usually due to an incident that triggers-off the association, and restores the memory.Illustration of neural activityOld age is another reason why people lose their memory. When it happens in old age it is called senility and it is often referred to as second childhood as these people act and behave as a child as they can no longer recall simple everyday functions.However, even people with normal memory often forget simple everyday things like phone numbers or names of acquaintances. It is at the tip of the tongue but for that particular instant they are unable to recall it. This happens because they have not paid enough attention to store that information in the correct file and drawer of the brain. Perhaps they did not consider the matter important enough!Some people can glance at a page of a book and recall every word that is written on it. Is it a miracle? No, you and I could do it either. All we need are a concentration to detail and a desire to slot things in the orderly filing cabinet of the brain. Oh! And the almonds might help too.",

    "title": "What is Physiotherapy?",
    "article": "If you’ve ever been laid up in bed because of a broken leg, or with an arm in a cast, you’ll know how limp that limb feels when it is finally out of bandages. That’s because the muscles in that particular part of the body have not been used for so long that they’ve ‘forgotten’ how to function. They need to be re-taught their work, and this is where physiotherapy comes in.Physiotherapy is that branch of medicine, which makes use of physical agents or exercises to treat a disease or an injury. It is also called physical therapy.Doctors who specialise in this branch of rehabilitation medicine are called physiotherapists or physical therapists.Interestingly, physiotherapy is helpful in almost every branch of medicine. Patients with paralysis, or muscle weakness caused by poliomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, with a heart or lung problem, or those recovering from broken bones, all need the help of a physiotherapist to get back on their feet.While the most basic and critical tool of all physiotherapists are their hands, they do use an array of devices too. Some devices heat parts of the body, since heat tends to lessen pain and improve blood circulation. Radiant heat lamps are used for warming up the body to reduce pain in the backbone.A room for physiotherapy with professional modern equipmentElectric heating pads, diathermy, hydrotherapy (water treatment) and special baths are used to apply heat to the diseased or damaged parts of the body.Cooling too is critical. Soon after certain injuries, such as sprains, ice packs are applied to reduce pain and swe1ling. Ultraviolet lamps are used to kill certain germs. Ultrasonic waves are used to treat inflammatory conditions of muscles and joints.Exercise is the most important part of physiotherapy. In fact, most people believe physiotherapy is only concerned with different kinds of physical exercise. However, physiotherapists use a variety of equipment such as pulleys, weights, parallel oars, stationary bicycles and dumb-bells.Disabled people benefit greatly from the services of a physiotherapist. With the help of splints, braces, crutches and wheel chairs, physiotherapists help them to move around on their own and manage their daily tasks themselves.This is one of the reasons we see physiotherapists working in different places – in clinics, hospitals and schools for the handicapped.",

    "title": "What is Pluto – a Star or a Comet?",
    "article": "Which is the planet farthest from the sun? Pluto, of course.But, some recent findings suggest that Pluto is not a planet at all. It seems Pluto could actually be a comet, reports the National Geographic website – www.nationalgeographic.comBasically, it is Pluto’s small size that has got it into trouble. It has a diameter of approximately 1,420 miles or 2,280 kilometers. This makes it six times smaller than Earth. This fact irked scientists who always suspected that something so small could never belong to the hallowed club of planets.Pluto also has an unusual orbit. In fact, it is the only planet which travels in an elliptical orbit and it also crosses the orbit of its closest neighbour, Neptune. This makes Pluto spend 20 years of its 248 year orbit as the second most farthest planet from the sun.What is Pluto – a Star or a Comet?The Kuiper beltIn 1992, David Jewitt and J. Luu of the University of Hawaii discovered a small icy body which they named 1992 QB1. This object was found around Pluto’s domain. Since then, over 100 such objects have been discovered and are thought to be similar to Pluto in composition, consisting primarily of ice and rock.This swarm of Pluto-like objects beyond Neptune is known as the Kuiper Belt, named after Gerard Kuiper, who first proposed that such a belt existed.The Kuiper belt is estimated to have at least 35,000 Pluto-like objects. Scientists are therefore thinking of demoting Pluto from the status of a planet to that of a Kuiper belt object or a KBO.However, there is a great amount of debate in the scientific community regarding this new finding. Several astronomers believe that Pluto is a planet because it is larger than any of the KBOs and it is spherical in shape.",

    "title": "What is Ribotyping?",
    "article": "Consider this, in a murder case, the culprit has left no clues. There are no fingerprints or eye witnesses.A perfect crime, you would say. But on close inspection, the crime branch discovers a tiny strand of hair. Back in the forensic laboratories, scientists use this strand of hair to track down the criminal and solve the murder case.But, how can you crack a mystery with a strand of hair, you would exclaim.The technique used by forensic scientists to track down the culprit is called DNA-fingerprinting. DNA stands for deoxy-ribo-nucleic acid. The DNA is present in every cell of our body and contains information needed by the cell to go about its activities.The DNA code for every individual is different and unique, just like our fingerprints. Forensic scientists know how to read this DNA code and tell one from another. This is what finally leads them to the culprit.What is Ribotyping?Now, scientists are using the technique of DNA mapping to track water pollution in coastal areas. Often, the sea is used as a garbage dump by humans. The garbage contains sewage water, which has a lot of faecal matter.But, it is very difficult to trace the source of these pollutants, since water reaches the sea through various channels. Until now, it was impossible to find out who the real pollutant culprit is.Now, scientists at the University of Missouri-Columbia, USA, are using DNA-fingerprinting to find whether the source of pollution is human or animal faeces. The key to this new technique lies in finding tiny bacteria called Escherichia Coli and identifying its strains in faeces.Escherichia Coli: The helpful bacteriaSeveral bacteria live in the guts of humans and other animals and help in digesting food. E. Coli is one such bacteria. What the scientists are planning to do is to try and find the presence of this bacteria in water. “Their detection in water warns of the possible presence of disease-causing strains of Escherichia coli, salmonella, or hepatitis virus”, says professor Andrew Carson.Since there are several strains of this bacteria which inhabit the stomachs of animals, scientists (have to fill in data) are attempting to create a library of E. Coli strains found in humans and other animals.Once a sample is collected from the beach water, it can be compared against the samples in the library for the presence of that particular strain that inhabits human stomachs. This will tell the biologists whether the source of pollution is human or animal sewage. This technology is called ribo-typing.Once the cause is found, the pollution causing sewer or drain (since there are separate drains for humans and animal farms) can be easily identified and checked.",

    "title": "What is Vetiver Grass?",
    "article": "If you ask someone what vetiver is, chances are that you might get a blank look. But mention the word khus, and most people will be all-smiles. For this grass have the sweetest and coolest fragrance that beat the summer heat. That is why for centuries Indians have had vetiver or khus mats and screens in their homes. A steady sprinkle of water is enough to keep the hot summer wind out.Chrysopogon zizanioides, commonly known as vetiver found abundantly in India, is of Asian origin. It gets its name from the Tamil word ‘vetriver’, meaning root. From India it travelled to the West Indies, Fiji and Africa, where a new use was found for it – as a sponge to hold the soil in place and prevent erosion, according to a report by the Academy for Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehra Dun, in north India. Creating environmentally sustainable technologies at the local level, is its main concern.Chrysopogon zizanioides, commonly known as vetiver found abundantly in India.How does vetiver prevent erosion? The grass is planted in rows to form a hedge. This hedge allows the silt in the water to deposit on one side while water seeps into the ground through the other, instead of running off. Thus, vetiver conserves moisture as well as soil. As the silt builds up behind the hedge, the grass grows with it. Eventually, natural terraces are formed, held up by the tough roots of khus.Vetiver has tidy habits. It stays where it is: two rows of vetiver grass planted 60 years ago in northern Rhodesia were in the same place, in 1984. It produces no seeds and its roots are unadventurous. So it does not pollute the farmer’s crop. Its long roots enable it to survive droughts.There is more. The grass is fireproof and animal proof. No matter how hungry cattle are, they will not touch it.The virtues of the fragrant vetiver grass have been well-tested abroad. It was used in Fiji, 30 years ago, when severe erosion endangered the sugar industry. Yields doubled in the first few years after vetiver was put to good use. The land is healthy again, erosion has all but disappeared, and the farmers swear by this grass.The biggest irony is that vetiver has not been used for this purpose in India – the land where many claim it grew originally. There is no reason to think that it would not work here. The grass seems to be able to adapt to most of India’s climatatic variations. It is found in Karnataka as well as in the Himalayas, growing in any region that receives 200mm to 2000mm of rainfall annually.",

    "title": "What is Water Harvesting?",
    "article": "Come summer and the entire nation seems to have just one word on its lips – water. Year 2000 saw one of the worst summers recorded in the history of India. The drought in the state of Gujarat and Rajasthan was the worst in decades.Fresh water, they say is a scarce resource. Is it?During the monsoons every year, we allow huge amounts of fresh water to run off our roads and pavements into the drains where it mixes with the sewage and heads straight for the rivers where we dump waste. Did you know that this rain water is enough to see us through the summers?When the summer months arrive, the rivers usually dry up. And our water needs increase. This puts pressure on other sources of water, like ground water. As a result, our tube wells and bore wells start working overtime.This is why ground water levels are going down across the country. Where earlier water could be found at a depth of 20 feet, now we have to dig as deep as 200 feet.What is Water Harvesting?There is an easy solutionConsider this. If we were to collect all the water which rains on our terrace, roads and pavements instead of letting it run into the ditches, we could actually have vast reserves of water.All we need to do this is create rain water tanks to store water. If water tanks and reserves are expensive and difficult to maintain, we could even dig huge pits and make open reservoirs. These reservoirs would not only collect the rain water but also allow it to seep into the ground and raise the ground water level.This type of water management and storage of rain water is called water harvesting.It is actually a very old technique that has been used by a lot of traditional societies for generations. Water tanks, check dams, storage wells and reservoirs are dotted all over rural India and have seen villagers through several summers. In Kishori village of Alwar district in Rajasthan, farmers have made Johads or check dams to trap rain water and store them in huge reservoirs.As water scarcity increases, we will also have to look towards such traditional but revolutionary water management methods.",

    "article": "It looks like a small kangaroo for its hind legs are longer than its fore legs. And it uses its tail to balance itself. In fact, unlike other rats it does not run on all four legs but jumps around from bush to bush in search of food – like a kangaroo. And that’s why it is called the kangaroo rat.It has another unique feature. Unlike most animals, the kangaroo rat does not need to drink water.The kangaroo rat is found in the southwestern deserts of the United States of America (USA). This region gets very little rainfall in a year and hence has very scarce vegetation. And so, over a period of time plants and animals have evolved their own mechanisms for survival in inhospitable surroundings – they make do with very little water for survival. Such is the case with the kangaroo rat as well.Kangaroo rats, small rodents of genus Dipodomys, are native to western North America.Water from roots and plantsIt needs very little water to survive. Whatever little water it requires it gets by eating roots and desert plants. Desert plants serve as food and drink to this animal.The kangaroo rat shows several remarkable qualities which makes it well suited for a life in the desert. Firstly, it has the ability to convert the dry seeds it eats into water.Moreover, unlike other animals, this creature does not sweat or pant to keep cool. Its kidney is made such that it allows the kangaroo rat to excrete waste without losing much water.If there ever was to be an award for the king of the desert, the kangaroo rat would surely win hands down.",

    "title": "What is a Tornado?",
    "article": "If you ever happen to see a dark often greenish sky, wall cloud, large hail and a loud roar similar to a freight train then run to a safe place as it could be a tornado.Popularly known as twisters, tornado is derived from Spanish word ‘Tronada’ meaning thunderstorm and ‘Tornar’ meaning to turn.A tornado is defined as a violently rotating column of air that can spin faster than 300 m.p.h., extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. They are generally observed as tube-or funnel-shaped clouds. At ground level they usually leave a path of destruction about 50 m wide and travel an average of about 8 to 24 km.Tornadoes generally exhibit a certain characteristic cycle of behaviour between formation and final disappearance. The first sign of a tornado may be a strong whirlwind of dust from the ground surface, often in conjunction with the appearance of a short funnel growing from the storm cloud above it. The funnel then becomes more organised and descends further from the cloud, sometimes touching the ground. The funnel as a whole moves forward slowly but can travel at speeds greater than 30 meters per second. The tornado eventually becomes fragmented and dissipates.A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the earth and the clouds.Tornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move over land. They are the result of great instability in the atmosphere and are often associated with severe thunderstorms. The full details of the formation of tornadoes are not known. Before thunderstorms develop, a change in wind direction and an increase in wind speed with increasing height creates an invisible horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere. Rising air within the thunderstorm updraft tilts the rotating air from horizontal to vertical.An area of rotation, 2-6 miles wide, now extends through much of the storm. Most strong and violent tornadoes form within this area of strong rotation. Softball size hail and damaging winds also occur with this storm.Tornadoes take many shapes and sizes. Weak tornadoes form 69% of all tornadoes and cause less than 5% of tornado deaths. The lifetime is 1 to 10 minutes and wind speed is less than 110mph. Strong tornadoes form 29% of all tornadoes and cause nearly 30% of all tornado deaths. They may last 20 minutes or longer and wind speed is between 110 to 205 mph.It is commonly believed that areas near rivers, lakes and mountains are safe from tornadoes. No place is safe. In fact in the late 1980’s a tornado swept through Yellowstone national park in the US leaving a path of destruction up and down a 10,000 ft mountain. It is also believed that windows should be opened before a tornado approaches to equalise pressure and minimise damage. However opening of windows only allows damaging winds to enter the structure. Leave the windows alone instead go to a safe place.Trivia about tornadoesAlthough tornadoes form all over the world, they are more frequent and stronger in US.A tornado that forms over warm water is called a waterspout. The water in the spout comes from condensation, not from the water below.When it forms over a desert, it’s called a dustdevil.Neither are strong tornadoes.The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 to 40 mph but can go as fast as 70mph and has rotational speed that can be more than 300mph.Tornadoes can occur in series (one after another) and more than one can form from the same cloud system.The worst series of tornadoes in history was on March 18, 1925. About 689 people were killed in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.Usually in the northern atmosphere (above the equator) tornadoes turn counter-clockwise (left).In the southern hemisphere, tornadoes usually turn clockwise.Tornadoes can be invisible!!! They appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up.Tornadoes can be over a mile-wide or really skinny.Tornadoes occur mostly in May. They occur the least in the months of January and February. Tornadoes occur most frequently during the middle and late afternoon.Scientists can’t rate or know how strong a tornado is until after it is over.",

    "title": "What is a Tsunami?",
    "article": "Last year there were three more fishing villages in the Pacific island country of Papua New Guinea than there are today. You might ask why. The answer is that these three villages were washed away by an ocean wave that was more like a giant wall of water. It goes by the name tsunami, a Japanese term meaning a harbour wave.A tsunami is caused by a disturbance in the sea floor, just like the disturbances on land. It may take the form of a quake or volcanic eruption or landslides on the ocean floor. Imagine the slab-like pieces of the sea floor, each of which may be hundreds of kilometres long. And imagine these slabs moving against each other, forcing one or the other upwards.This upward movement simply pushes the water up. The movement of water is from the deeper parts of the ocean into the shallower parts. And since the shallow parts of the ocean cannot withstand the force of the incoming water, it has only one way to go – and that is up, up and up, creating a huge wave.Basic types of tsunamiThis giant wall of water can reach up to 20 to 30 metres. This ocean wave has the power to come down on land settlements, destroying them immediately. Sometimes tsunamis travel thousands of miles before reaching land. This is what happened to the three fishing villages in Papua New Guinea last year, when a 23 metre wall of water struck them. Almost 6000 people died there and then.",

    "article": "What is nature’s most powerful, most destructive, most dangerous form? Some would say an earthquake, others a cyclone. However, these phenomenon are relatively smaller and less destructive in scale compared to the fury of a volcano.Fourteen miles southeast of Naples in Italy, lie the remains of an ancient town called Pompeii. The city flourished under the shadows of the towering Mount Vesuvius. In 79 AD, the volcano erupted, destroying the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae and Torre Annunziata.Mount Pelee, another volcano, arose from sleep in 1902 and wiped out the city of St. Pierre and its 30,000 inhabitants completely. The story of Mount St. Helens is even more terrifying. On 18 May, 1980, after days of volcanic activity, Mount St. Helens erupted.An avalanche of hot gases, rocks, ash and ice swept across the landscape at a speed of more than 250 kilometres per hour (160 miles per hour ) destroying 550 square kilometres (210 square miles) of mountain terrain, which is equal to an area almost as big as a small city. The area was home to an amazing diversity of plant and animal life.The volcanic matter went up to a distance of 20 kilometres in the sky, spewing gas, steam and ash straight into the stratosphere (one of the lower layers of the earth’s atmosphere).Let us try and understand what a volcano is.The Kilauea volcano erupts on the island of Hawaii with plumes of fire and smoke. Rivers of lava head to the ocean making new land.The earth has several layers under the surface. The upper crust on which we stay is called the lithosphere. Deep inside the earth’s body is the magma, which basically comprises rocks and other materials in a super heated state.Most things when heated to a certain point, melt and then turn into gas. So, the earth’s crust has a lot of gas which is constantly expanding, thus increasing the pressure inside.This magma tries to break through any weak spot on the earth’s surface. A volcano is basically this weak spot. It is a vent or a hole in the earth’s crust through which molten magma, gases and rocks are forced out because of the high pressure inside.In other words, the earth is like a pressure cooker of magma and hot gases. Whenever the pressure becomes too high, it forces some of its insides out. This is a volcanic eruption.Types of volcanoesVolcanoes are broadly classified into two categories based on the modes of eruption. They are the fissure and central types.In a fissure volcano, the magma oozes out of large cracks in the earth’s crust. The magma flow is not violent and its deposition forms new land forms like plateaus and even new islands.A central volcano is one in which the magma comes out of a small area on the earth’s crust called the volcanic crater. This is generally very violent in nature.Volcanic eruptions mould and shape the earth’s structure. They give rise to new land masses and constantly create changes in the earth’s atmosphere.",

    "title": "What is a virus?",
    "article": "Viruses are these tiny, invisible structures that cause infections. They make us sick. There are millions of viruses in our environment but only about 5000 have been identified by scientists. The ones you may have heard of are the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV and the Novel Coronavirus or Covid-19.What do viruses look like?Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Do you think that a virus is some creepy, crawly thing? It is not. A virus is a non-living thing. It is invisible to the human eye. A virus is one hundred times smaller than a bacteria, which is why most viruses cannot be seen even under a microscope.So how does a virus make someone sick?To make someone sick, a virus needs a host. The host is that living creature inside which the virus can multiply and spread, and generally make a nuisance of itself. The host could be a human body, an animal, or even as tiny as a bacteria. First, the virus needs to enter the living body. It could enter through blood or saliva or even sneeze droplets. Next, the virus turns that living body into a virus photocopying machine. Once infected by a virus, a living body starts creating multiple copies of the virus. Before you know it, that body is bursting with viruses and is sick.And how does a virus spread?To spread from a body full of a virus to a body that does not have the virus, the virus needs a way. Imagine an elevator, taking the virus from one body to the next. In the case of HIV, the elevator that carries the virus from one body to the next is blood, saliva or semen. Let us take the example of a person infected with HIV. If they have a bleed, and they touch someone else who also has a cut in their skin, and their bloods mix, then the HIV virus could enter the second person. Some viruses, like Covid-19, travel in the tiny droplets that come out of our bodies when we cough or sneeze. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, then droplets of fluid carry the virus out. If you are close enough, then the virus will go up your nose and into your lungs. These types of viruses are called respiratory viruses, because they affect our breathing. Which is why doctors say, don’t touch your face, wear a mask, and wash your hands with soap.",

    "title": "What is an Earthquake?",
    "article": "One moment, the world seems just the way it was yesterday, the day before, last year, or even the day before the day before. All is well with the world. It’s a beautiful sunny day and you are sitting drinking your morning tea or coffee relaxed and enjoying the day. Suddenly there is a rattling of plates and glasses. Within seconds chairs and tables are rocking violently, the fans sway crazily and crockery is falling off the shelves. Help!! Sometimes plaster falls from the ceiling, walls develop cracks or worse still, they collapse. The very earth is shaking!This shaking motion is called an earthquake, the result of a sudden release of energy from below the surface of the earth. Few disasters can cause such havoc as an earthquake.Earthquakes have rocked the world since time immemorial. But what causes it? The earth can be divided into four main layers: the solid inner core, the liquid outer core, the mantle, and the crust. An earthquake is caused by a sudden rupture in a fault. A fault is the fracture within the rocky mass inside the earth’s crust. The depth and length of faults vary greatly.Rescue team is searching for the wounded aftter the earthquake. Prometheus72 / Shutterstock.comStress in the earth’s outer layer cause a pushing effect against the sides of the fault. Due to this motion, rocks slip or collide against each other releasing energy. This released energy travels in waves through the earth’s crust and causes the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.Faults are divided into three main groups. Reverse fault – when two plates collide and one side of the fracture moves on top of another; normal fault -when two plates are moving apart; and strike-slip or lateral – when two plates slide past each other.Under the surface of the earth, the two sides of a fault are constantly moving, relative to one another. This movement is known as a fault slip. The movement of these two sides is not smooth and is accompanied by a gradual build-up of elastic strain energy within the rocks along the fault. The rocks store this strain like a giant spring being slowly wound up.Eventually, the strain along the fault becomes too much and the rocks can no longer bear the tension. The fault then ruptures with a sudden movement releasing all the energy built up over the years. This energy is released in the form of vibrations called ‘seismic waves’.These waves travel along the surface and through the earth at varying speeds depending on the material through which they move. It is actually these seismic waves that cause most of the destructive effects, which we associate with earthquakes.The location on a fault where the slip first occurs is called the hypocentre, whereas the position directly above it on the ground surface is called the epicentre.When these seismic waves reach the surface of the earth, they give rise to strong ground motion causing building and other man-made structures to shake or collapse or develop cracks and fissures.Earthquakes can also cause landslides, sudden eruptions as in the case of a hot lava flow from a volcano or giant waves called tsunamis. Sometimes new land mass are also formed. Such earthquakes are attributed with the creation of the greatest undersea mountain range (stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean and under the Pacific Ocean) and the longest land mountain range (the Himalaya-Karakoram range).It is estimated that there are 5,00,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. Of these only 1,00,000 are felt, and only 100 of them cause actual damage.Though there are certain parts of the earth where earthquakes are frequent, the majority of earthquakes occur along the earth’s plate boundaries, which carry the continents and the ocean floor. They occur most between the Pacific plate and the North American plate commonly referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire.Although it is known why earthquakes occur, there is no reliable method of accurately predicting the time, place and magnitude of an earthquake. So if you feel the earth shake under your feet, you are either in love or it is an earthquake you are experiencing.",

    "title": "What is an ISBN number?",
    "article": "There are hundreds of thousands of publishers across the world, and millions of books get printed every year. Moreover, a book like The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a book that has been printed by several publishers. This makes the task of identifying a book very difficult.To overcome the problem of identifying books, publishers have came up with a unique numbering system. For instance, if 50,000 copies of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are printed by a publisher at one time (called an edition), all of them are identified by one number code. This number code is like your home address that cannot be shared by anyone else apart from your parents and siblings.Your address begins with your house number, street, locality, state and ends with a statement of the country where you live. An ISBN book number achieves a similar aim of identifying and tracing a book.What is an ISBN number?ISBN: a book’s addressIf you pick up any book, turn it around you will see a number which looks something like this – ISBN 90-70002-34-5. This is called the ISBN number. Do you know what this means?ISBN stands for International Standard Book Numbering. It is a numbering system that is used to describe the book. The ISBN number is a 10 digit number, divided into four groups that are separated by a space or a hyphen.The first part of the ISBN identifies the country and is called the Group Identifier. The Group Identifier may consist of up to 5 digits. In the above example, 90 specifies the country.The second part is called the Publisher Prefix. The Publisher Prefix is used to identify the publisher of the book. The publisher prefix may contain up to seven digits. In the above example, 70002 specifies the publsiher.The third part of the ISBN identifies the title and the edition of the book and so is called the Title Identifier. A title identifier may consist of up to six digits. Book publishers often come out with newer and updated versions of earlier books. Since you can have the same book from the same publisher but with different editions, the Title Identifier helps to differentiate between them.The fourth and the final part of the ISBN is called the Check digit. It is a single digit (from 0 to 9) that is used to check whether the given ISBN number is correct or wrong. Since all ISBN numbers are allocated by the respective countries’ ISBN agency, no two books can have the same ISBN number.The check digit is used to check whether an ISBN number is incorrect. If it is, this means that the book is a duplicate or a version printed illegally.The ISBN numbering systems helps book stores and book publishers to handle, categorise, store and identify books easily.",

    "article": "If you have seen the movie Free Willy, you would be able to instantly recognise an Orca. Willy is an Orca or a killer whale.Orcas (Orcinus orca) are mammals classified under the order Cetacea. Though they are called killer whales, they belong to the dolphin family. Like other whales and dolphins, they, too, come up to the surface to take in oxygen.Orcas can be found in all the oceans of the world. Orcas are found in pods which is the collective term for these animals like ‘a gaggle” for geese or ‘school’ for fish. A pod may consist of two or three groups with each group consisting of 15 or 20 members.A mature male Orca whale swims with a baby whale.The male Orca weighs up to eight tonnes and reaches a length of 23 feet. The female is however, small, weighing only four tonnes with a length of 18 feet. Female Orcas may give birth to one calf measuring seven feet.Both male and female Orcas look similar. They have conical snouts, huge foreheads and even have similar colouring. Their top surface or dorsal is black, while the bottom surface or ventral is white. Orcas are also sometimes mistaken for the shark because of their characteristic six-foot tall dorsal fin.Orcas have no enemies under the sea except man. They are very fearless and attack larger fish too. Orcas have a row of 50-60 teeth and eat whatever they find. Of course, it has to taste good to them as well.This includes other smaller whales, penguins, fish, turtles, seals and even octopi. Because of the characteristic dorsal fin and their reputation for fearlessness they are sometimes referred to as the killer whales.A single pod may contain both mature adults and teenage Orcas, but they do not travel together in the same group. These animals, like dolphins and whales communicate with each other by means of whistles.",

    "article": "As bats flap through the musty castle, a coffin lid creaks open and an ashy white hand gropes for the cover. The lid slides off and a caped figure rises in the gloom – Dracula is on the prowl! Vampires have enthralled generations of readers and moviegoers; and the most popular ‘vampire’ is the fearsome Count Dracula of Transylvania.Of course, these blood-sucking monsters do not exist and are merely the figment of our imagination.Mystery of DraculaBritish writer, Bram Stoker, created the Dracula myth for his 1897 horror novel, ‘Dracula’. Many historians believe that Bram’s Dracula was inspired by a 15th century Romanian ruler named Vlad Tepes (pronounced “tsep-pesh”).Vlad ruled Wallachia (now part of Romania – in southeastern Europe) more than 600 years ago and is believed to have been very, very cruel. Vlad wasn’t a vampire at all, but he did invent some spine-chilling forms of torture and used the nickname “Dracul” or “Dracula” which means both “devil” and “dragon.”In the 21st century, Vlad’s terrible reputation is coming in handy for a cash-starved country. For the past few years, Romania has been cashing in on the Dracula myth by organising an annual World Dracula Congress in the city of Sighisoara. The birthplace of Tepes, Sighisoara is part of a larger region called Transylvania in western Romania.The festival sees the screening of vampire movies; and fans, moviemakers, writers and history students from all over the world participate.Discussions are held on Dracula legends, and debates on vampire myths are hotly contested. The festival is a huge tourist attraction and small Dracula souvenirs, including tiny coffin shaped boxes and bottles of blood red wine, are sold for profit.The residents of Transylvania are now hoping that the next step will be a Dracula theme park. Looking to boost the economy of the country, the Romanian government has made the theme park a top priority and negotiations are currently underway with foreign investors.",

    "article": "On beaches as well as on the cricket ground, it is always possible to spot people with some kind of cream on their bodies or faces. Remember the South African pace bowler Alan Donald or ‘White Lightning’ as he is called, with “war-paint” on his face? No, it is not an attempt at camouflage, simply an effort to gain protection from the ultraviolet rays of the sun.And therein lies a paradox – it is the light and heat of the sun that sustains life on earth, but among its many friendly rays are some harmful ones as well. These ultraviolet (UV, as they are called in all popular sunscreen lotions) rays can kill life forms, including humans, if they are exposed to it beyond a limit.What is the Ozone Hole?Ultraviolet: Is it a shade of violet?The white sunlight that we see, is formed of seven different colours, or the VIBGYOR – short for violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. Violet is at one end, while red is at the other extreme of this visible band of light.Only that light which falls between these colours, is visible to humans. Light rays which fall below the violet colour, are called ultraviolet rays. Those that fall beyond the colour red are called infrared. Sunlight contains both ultraviolet and infrared rays.How are we protected from these rays?These rays have always been a part of sunlight, but they have become big threats to humans today. Why? The earth’s atmosphere is composed of several layers. We live in the Troposphere where most of the weather patterns such as rain, snow and clouds, occur. Above the troposphere is the Stratosphere.Supersonic jet airliners such as the Concorde fly in this layer, whereas subsonic commercial airliners usually fly in the troposphere. It is in the stratosphere that the ultraviolet rays strike the oxygen, converting it into a gas called ozone.Friendly ozone layerThe ozone in the stratosphere absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. These rays can otherwise cause skin cancer and damage vegetation, among other things. Exposure to these ultraviolet rays kills bacterias and several microorganisms that are very important for the earth’s ecology. Unfortunately, this layer is getting depleted.The ozone layer has a hole in itIn 1996 studies conducted by US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revealed a big hole of roughly 10 million square miles (greater than the total surface area of North America) over the continent of Antarctica. This is known as the ozone hole. As a result of this large amount of ultraviolet rays enter the lower atmosphere. If not checked in time the ozone depletion can cause dangerous consequences.Human hand in ozone depletion.Quite interestingly the destruction of ozone is a human phenomenon. Like air pollution, reducing the levels of pollutants that we emit in the atmosphere, can control it. Most air-conditioners, refrigerators and spray cans contain a substance called CFC (chlorofluorocarbons) that destroys the ozone gas, converting it into other gases. This is what has caused the ozone hole over a period of time.It is precisely for this reason that worldwide standards for air-conditioning equipments are being modified. A new substance called HFC (hydrofluorocarbons) is being used instead of CFC.So, the next time you use that room freshener or your perfume spray, think of the ozone hole that could be expanding with every passing second.",

When he was not occupied with dismantling everything that moved, ticked, or clicked he would be engaged in stuffing an icecube down your shirt when you were busy working on whatever it is that didn’t involve him.After a lot of thought, my uncle and I decided to purchase something that would rack his brains till kingdom come. We scouted the market for all sorts of things and luckily we came to a shop that sold a colourful cube – the Rubik’s cube.Akshay was overjoyed at this new acquisition. He was lost to the world and every waking moment was spent trying to get the colours of the cube in order.No dice! He was truly stuck. He was loath to give up and admit he was lost. Days turned to weeks and into months. In sheer frustration he asked: just what is the Rubik’s cube?The Rubik’s cube was invented in 1975 by Erno Rubik, an Architecture Professor at the Budapest School of Commercial Art, in Hungary. It is a six-sided multi-coloured object that splits into three rows and three columns. Each row or column is capable of turning a full circle of 360 degrees.Thus each side is made of nine squares. Each side of the cube has a certain colour and when the rows and columns are rotated, these colours then shift to another side.The object of the game is to twist or rotate the multi-coloured cube and find a way to get all the sides to have a uniform colour. The orange side should have all nine squares orange, another should have all white and so on.What is the Rubik’s Cube?The problem with the cube was that there were over 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible positions into which the cube could be manipulated. It was not easy to find a solution to this cube. A wrong twist and the entire side changed colours!Erno Rubik wanted to teach aspects of 3-dimensional objects to architecture students. So he devised this cube and applied for a patent in 1975. The cube soon became a rage in Hungary. Rubik then figured, why not market it in Europe?So he contacted toy manufacturers in Europe and America. Ideal Toys contracted Rubik to produce it for the United States market. By 1980, the cube was the fastest selling toy in the market and shopkeepers couldn’t keep pace with the demand!In 1980 alone, the cube sold over 4.5 million units! Pirated versions began overtaking the original. Solving the cube in the fastest possible time soon became a fad and to help achieve this, several books were published giving the final solution and hints to achieve this in the shortest possible time.There were cases of solving the cube within a minute. A downslide to the popularity of the cube was that people developed painful muscular problems called tendinitus due to constant twisting and turning of the wrist!Unfortunately overexposure killed this wonderful, mathematical toy. Some me-too products tried to take on from where the cube left off but failed to catch on.What was meant for a classroom lecture demonstration twisted the world topsy turvy with a flick of the wrist. However, it is an excellent toy to pass the time with. And if you wish to exercise your wrist as well, there is nothing better than the Rubik’s cube to work on. Just don’t get your wrist wrested away with all the twisting.",

The paper was folded into a wheel, the pin inserted at the heart of it and the entire structure fixed to the broomstick.As our pinwheel took shape we ran out braving the sun and the hot wind. The pinwheel caught the wind and rotated. Seeing it, our hearts pin-wheeled as well.Energy from windA few days later we happened to see the photograph of a windmill in a magazine. “Don’t these windmills look exactly like the pinwheels we made?” my cousin shouted. And what did we find? That they are actually similar! Like the pinwheel, the windmill also uses the wind’s energy to turn the blades on a large wheel. This movement of the blades is used to pump water, generate electricity or pound grain.The land of windmillsOf course many others have recognised the strength of wind power. It is clean and it does not create pollution. Countries, which have abundance of wind power, have derived large benefits from wind energy.Traditional Dutch windmill in the NetherlandsTake Holland, for example. Why is it called the land of windmills? Because most of its land lies below sea level, and windmills are used to pump water into canals from low-lying areas that are filled with water. In the 17th century there were over 8,000 windmills in use in Holland!No wonder, as pollution rises, people in other parts of the world are slowly realising the power of simple solutions such as windmills.

Every machine in the world which has the Windows software installed has to have that button. However, we can have different screen colours, different text sizes, wallpapers etc.Similarly our bodies are essentially the same, but we have different colours, sizes, shapes and structures. Our body also has a software which is responsible for these differences between one human being and another. It is called the DNA.Digital illustration DNA structureWhere and what is the software?We all know that every living organism is made up of small units called cells. These cells are the building block of a organism. The human body is nothing but a collection of millions of such cells. Each cell performs a specific task in our body, the blood cells carry oxygen and food while the cells of our skin protect and give us colour.But how does a cell know what it has to do? Imagine what would happen if the skin cells performed the functions of our blood cells.The nucleus and the genetic codeEvery cell has a tiny compartment inside it, this is called the nucleus. All the information about the cell’s job is written on a molecule called the DNA and stored inside the nucleus. We could say the nucleus is like the hard-disk of your computer. This information is called the genetic code.DNA or deoxyribonucleic (spelled de-oxy-ribo-nucleic) acid, is the master molecule of life on earth. It is shaped liked a twisted ladder called a double helix. The ladder has rungs made up of four different molecular parts. These rungs, called the nucleotides, spell out the hereditary instructions for making a given organism.Every life form on earth has a different set of instructions. That is why one animal is different from another and why you are taller than your father.When an organism reproduces, it passes on its DNA to its offspring. When you were born, you got half of your DNA from your father and the other half from your mother. This is the reason why some of your features are like those of your mother while others like your father.Every creature on earth, be it a plant or an animal carries the DNA in it.

We used to yell, jump up with joy, clap our hands and strain our eyes as the ‘rocket’ disappeared into the horizon.Soon, the white streak would change into a broken, twisted cloud path. And we were told that it was the fairies’ trail.What is the Trail behind a Jet?What causes this white streak?The white streak is actually a cloud, though the aircraft is a normal jet liner and not a rocket. This white streak is called a ‘contrail’ or a condensation trail. The engine of a jet aircraft releases after- burners or fumes just like our cars and motorcycles.These fumes contain a lot of water vapour. At very high altitudes, where the temperature is as low as -38 degree celsius (water freezes at zero degrees), the water vapour freezes into tiny ice crystals almost instantly before evaporating.A contrail can spread out and form a horizontal sheet of cloud, as winds which blow at high altitudes blow it apart. It disappears eventually when the water vapour evaporates.Contrail or chemtrail?The fumes emanating from an aircraft contain several harmful chemicals which pollute the air at high altitudes. So, environmentalists have coined a new term for it – chemtrail or chemical trail. So much for the fairies’ trail.",

    "article": "As you stand in the middle of a playground or while you are sitting in your class, there is an immense weight right over your head, but you do not feel it! This is the weight of the atmosphere, or air, as we know it.Composed of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases, it surrounds the earth like an envelope. And, it extends almost a thousand kilometres above the Earth’s surface.Like all other substances, air also has weight. Imagine, we are actually talking about a thousand-kilometre high column of air above our heads. This is known as the atmospheric pressure.Barometer measures atmospheric pressureWhy don’t our bones get crushed under this weight?Actually, our bodies have an internal pressure, which counters that of the atmospheric pressure and, in the process, balances it out. This internal pressure is essential for our survival.A little change in the atmospheric pressure can make us feel sick. This is the reason why mountaineers get sick at high altitudes. As we go higher, the air becomes thin and hence, the atmospheric pressure also decreases.How is it measured?It is measured as weight of the atmosphere for a given area. Or, the amount of weight on a small area, such as a centimetre. In 1643, Evangelista Torricelli, an Italian mathematician, invented an instrument to measure atmospheric pressure. It is called the barometer.A barometer consists of an empty tube from which air has been taken out. This tube is inverted into a dish of mercury. Since the dish of mercury is subjected to the pressure of the air above it, some of the mercury is pushed into the tube.The level to which mercury rises is measured in inches and this indicates the atmospheric pressure. On a clear day (clouds and high winds can alter atmospheric pressure), at sea level, mercury rises to a height of 29.792 inches (76 centimetres), in a barometer. This is equal to 14.70 pounds (6.6 kilograms) per square inch of area. Hence, at sea level, we carry about 6.6 kilograms of weight on every inch of our body.",

And like all delightful accidents of history, the origin of this multi-faceted OK seems to lie in a humourous misspelling of the words ‘all correct’ as ‘orl korrect’, approximately 170 years ago, in the US.So says the dictionaries team of the Oxford Word and Language Service (OWLS), whose job it is to answer the queries of curious users of the English language. OWLS was launched by the Oxford University Press in 1983, which periodically publishes a compilation of many such queries. Among those questions is one on the origin of OK.Many other explanations have been put forth, such as the Greek ola kala (‘it is good’), and the French aux Cayes , (‘from Cayes’, Cayes being a Haitian port known for its good quality rum). Some have also wondered if OK originated from the initials of Obeidah Kelly, a railway freight agent who wrote his initials OK on the documents that he had checked!What is the origin of OK?‘Orl korrect’ seems to have won because it is supported by documentary evidence. Its earliest recorded use can be found in the Boston Morning Post of March 23, 1839. Though, in the 1840s, supporters of a politician Martin Van Buren formed the OK (Old Kinderhook) Club, named so after the birthplace Kinderhook (New York) of the politician.In fact, a judicial case of 1935 was decided on the basis of the ‘orl korrect’ origin of OK! It was a case involving a Japanese rice merchant, Nippon Menkwa Kabushiki Kaesha versus Dawson’s Bank, in the US. The rice merchant had written OK along with his initials on some of the invoices. The case was decided on the basis that OK was to be taken as the full words ‘All Correct’!Now someone needs to find out how and when OK got modified to Okidokey! Any takers apart from OWLS?",

    "title": "What kind of Family Life did the Dinosaurs Have?",
    "article": "In Argentina this year, scientists digging on a site made a fantastic discovery, which made them realise that dinosaurs lived as a large family. The site consisted of many nests with each nest containing as many as 15 to 30 eggs. The eggs belonged to a plant-eating dinosaur called Titanosaurs. It is the biggest nesting site of dinosaurs found so far.The word dinosaur is a Greek word meaning giant reptile. Most reptiles lay eggs in nests but they walk away after the young hatch to fend for themselves.However, the discovery of this site and an earlier site discovered in 1978 in Montana, USA, has made scientists change their views about the dinosaurs.In Montana, eggs and skeletons of adults, babies and young teen dinosaurs were all found in one site. In other areas fossil footprints were found in large numbers suggesting that these dinosaurs lived as a family and travelled as a herd.At other sites the dinosaurs had communal nesting sites, or nests at the same place. These nesting sites or rookery are similar to current day turtle nesting sites in Orissa, India, where a large number of turtles come together to lay eggs.Scientists have also discovered that flesh-eating dinosaurs sometimes hunted in packs. Two or three of them would attack a single prey and kill it. This is unusual as it was thought that only mammals like the wolves hunt in packs. Fossils show the skeleton of a Tenontosaurus found near the skeletons of three carnivorous (flesh-eating) Deinonychus.",

    "title": "What to do During an Earthquake?",
    "article": "An earthquake is literally an earth shattering experience! Here you are enjoying an afternoon snooze, or having a cup of coffee in the morning or even sleeping under a quilt on a cold winter night when WHAM! The entire crockery shelf collapses shattering plates and cups; the painting on the wall nearly knocks you down as it falls; or the antique fan looks like it will brain you as it hangs down, held by a single wire!What does one do in such situations? There is no advance warning on prime time news nor is there a particular time of year, like monsoons, when an earthquake always occurs. Unlike a tornado or hurricane there are no known methods of predicting an earthquake. Scientists have, however, managed to chart out areas of the world that is earthquake prone, like the San Andreas Fault in North America, the Great African rift, etc. But knowing the area is prone to quakes and being in the centre of one are two different things.What to do During an Earthquake?Though it is estimated that about 5,00,000 earthquakes occur each year, only 100 of them cause damage! However, an earthquake could occur any time of the day or night so it pays to be prepared if you are unfortunately caught in the middle of one. There are certain dos and don’ts that can help you during an earthquake.If you are indoors, stay indoors unless you are in the ground floor (first floor to Americans) where you can easily run outside. The best thing to do if you are indoors is to hide under a sturdy piece of furniture like a bed or desk. Do not try to head for the stairway if you are living in an upper storey, as chances are the stairways may collapse.Stay away from windows, inside walls and movable furniture or appliances. The kitchen is a dangerous place as things stored in cupboards can fall on you. Don’t try to rush downstairs or outdoors while the building is shaking. There is greater danger of falling debris, glass, or staircases collapsing under your feet.If you are outdoors, try to reach an open ground. Stay away from high-rise buildings, trees, power and telephone cables or anything else that might fall on you.If you are driving on the road get out of the traffic and stop on a clear stretch of the road. Do not stop on a bridge or for that matter under one. Stay inside your car until the shaking stops. Before you resume driving, look out for fissures, breaks in the road, bumps and cracks. try to reach an open ground if you can.Inside your home, be careful not to turn on the gas until you are sure the cylinder is safe and there is no gas leak.Try not to use your telephone unless there is an emergency. You could be tying up lines needed for someone else’s emergency.Ensure you establish a meeting place with all family members in case you get separated. Transportation and aid may be disrupted for some days. In case you have to camp out till such time normalcy is restored, have some emergency supplies handy like medical supplies, flashlights, a portable radio for the news, adequate water in bottles, canned food, blankets, etc.Lastly, if you are not trapped or seriously hurt, do not expect fire fighters, army, police or paramedics to help you. They may be busy rescuing others who are in greater need than you are!",

    "article": "Imagine a journey that takes you a billion kilometres away from earth, to the edge of the solar system, from where you can look back over your shoulder and see our sun as just another star in the sky.We are not talking about a science fiction movie but the Voyager space mission. On August 20, 1977, the Voyager 2 spacecraft was launched. Close on its heels, the Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977. Both the unmanned spacecraft were launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, USA.They were sent to meet Jupiter and other planets that lay beyond it in the solar system.What were the Voyager Missions? Voyager-2 Spacecraft.The gas planets : Jupiter, Saturn, UranusVoyager 1 reached Jupiter on March 5, 1979, after covering a distance of 650 million kilometres (450 million miles) through space. Voyager 2 followed a couple of months later because it had taken a longer path. They circled the giant planet and a few of its moons. They also took close-up photographs of the mammoth planet.These photographs show a giant storm, three times the size of Earth, raging on Jupiter. This area stands out on any picture of the planet as a dark red sore and it is rightly called the ‘Great red spot’. The Voyagers discovered and sent back photographs of an active volcano on Io, one of Jupiter’s moons.From Jupiter, the Voyagers continued their journey to Saturn and Uranus. They discovered several thousand ‘ringlets’ around Saturn apart from the rings man already knew about. They also closely inspected Titan, one of the moons of Saturn.What is interesting about Titan is that its atmosphere looked like what the earth must have been before life evolved on it. Does this mean that Titan will support life on it one day? One does not know.The Voyagers discovered 10 new moons of Uranus and six new moons of Neptune. Uranus was earlier known to have five moons, while Neptune had only two.Where are the Voyagers headedAlthough the Voyagers’ mission was to unravel the secrets of the outer solar planets, the spacecraft are still sending back data about the outer reaches of the solar system. After this, they will continue their journey beyond the solar system.Imagine, as you read this article, the voyagers are still floating through space, billions of kilometres away. Will humans be able to travel on such a craft someday?",

    "article": "Scratch, scratch scratch goes your pet dog or cat. Behind the ears, on his body. He whips about trying to chew up his tail. What’s eating him? You part the hair and feel around. It’s a flea!Fleas are parasitic insects that suck the blood of birds and mammals. There are over 2,400 flea species worldwide classified under the order Siphonaptera. They are tiny wingless insects like the lice in our hair, either black or reddish brown.The flea body is flattened and has many spines and bristles, like a porcupine, all over its body. Fleas are found on cats and dogs and are very common during summers and humid rainy weather.This body design of spiny bristles allow easy movement between the fur of animals. These insects have six legs with a small claw at the tip to enable it to stay attached to the skin even as the animal scratches forcefully.Fleas are very agile and great jumpers. Though they are less than an inch, they can jump seven-eighth of an inch vertically and 14 to 16 inches horizontally. This is equal to a human jumping 600 feet in the air!Fleas are attracted to animals by body heat, movement and the carbon dioxide they exhale. They are normally found near the neck, behind the armpits or firmly attached in between the paws.Both male and female fleas suck blood and if the flea cannot find a dog or cat, they will even bite other animals and humans.An average dog flea lives for about 100 days. A female flea lays about 25 eggs a day and over a 1000 in her lifetime. By the time a flea pair dies they and their family could produce millions of other fleas! A female flea consumes 15 times its body weight in blood daily.A flea bite leaves a red itchy mark that is quite itchy. Although dog or cat fleas are not carriers of any specific disease, other fleas like the rat flea can transmit diseases like the typhus or bubonic plague.However, the flea is also a circus attraction. In a flea circus, these fleas are exhibited and made to show off their jumping prowess. No, I do not know if you can pick your fleas off your pet and make it join a circus, but you sure can help bring some comfort to your pet!",

    "title": "When a Cat Preys for Lunch",
    "article": "Many people have always believed that animals hunting for prey always catch the ones that are young, old or sick. For it would be difficult for those creatures to escape a predator’s hold. Till now there was no actual proof of this fact. But latest research by French scientists in Paris, France, has proved that it is true. A report on their research came out in ‘The Economist’ magazine recently. How did they do it?The scientists studied the hunting habits of domestic cats. And they studied the health of birds that were killed by cats with those killed in accidents. They made a detailed study of one organ or part of the birds’ bodies which was an indication of its good health. That organ was the spleen.The scientists chose the spleen because of a particular reason. Birds that are healthy have larger sized spleens than those which keep getting infections. The spleen greatly helps in strengthening the birds’ immune system or their capacity to fight disease. So from the size of the spleen the French scientists could find out if the birds killed by domestic cats were healthy or sickly.When a cat hunts a bird for lunchThey examined more than 500 birds from 18 different species and made very interesting discoveries. The spleens of birds killed by cats were much smaller than those killed in accidents. It means that they were not very healthy. This was true of 16 out of the 18 species they studied. By and large the spleens of birds killed in accidents were three times larger than the spleens of birds killed by domestic cats.Also most of the birds killed by the cats were young. Of those that died in accidents, half were young and half were adult. So while it is true that the young and the sickly birds are at a greater danger of becoming a cat’s lunch or dinner, old birds are able to take care of themselves.",

    "title": "When was the First Circumnavigation by Air?",
    "article": "Ever since Colombus set sail to see if the world was flat or round, intrepid explorers have vied with each other to go around the earth. The world has been circumnavigated by sea by Marco Polo and people have walked across continents from end to end. But until 1924 no one had tried to circumnavigate the world by air except over a continent by a balloon in a Jules Verne novel.Eight Americans decided to circumnavigate the world by plane. So in 1924, they set out from Seattle Washington, USA, in four Douglas World Cruisers and 175 days later three of the aircraft and crew returned to set a new world record.The Douglas World Cruiser biplane was a variant of the United States (US) Navy’s DT-2 torpedo bomber that could be operated either with wheels or floats. After successful tests of the prototype or the original four aircraft were ordered. Each plane was named after a US city: ‘Seattle’, ‘Chicago’, ‘Boston’, and ‘New Orleans’.Extensive planning went into the preparation of the trip. The Royal Air Force of Britain and the US Navy dispatched 30 spare engines all over the world prior to the flight; 28 nations promised to supply fuel and oil along the flight path.On April 6, 1924, the four biplanes left Seattle and headed west. The first snag occurred within six days of flying when the ‘Seattle’ crashed near Port Moller, in Alaska due to heavy blizzards and thunderstorms.The remaining three planes continued on to Japan, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, Europe, England, and Ireland, completing nearly three-fourths of the planned trip.On August 3, the ‘Boston’ was forced down in the North Atlantic. A prototype was dispatched to Nova Scotia, Canada, and the crew renamed the aircraft ‘Boston II’ and rejoined the adventure. On September 28, the three biplanes returned triumphantly to Seattle after 175 days covering 44,360 km, with stopovers in 61 cities in a total flying time of 371 hours, 11 minutes.Since a circumnavigation had been done it became necessary to set a speed record in this category. In 1933, another American, Wiley Post, did a solo circumnavigation between July 15 to 22, in seven days, 18 hours and 49 minutes in his Lockheed Vega. He covered 25,110 km (15,596 miles).In 1949, US Air force pilots went one better with a non-stop flight around the world in 94 hours 1 minute on a B-50 Superfortress called the Lucky Lady II though they were refuelled in the air.Finally there was only one record left to be broken. To circumnavigate, nonstop, without refuelling. On December 14th, 1986, Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager flew a canard wing plane the ‘Voyager’ and took off from Edwards Air force Base, California.A canard wing plane the ‘Voyager’ flown by Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager become the first aircraft to circumnavigate the globe nonstop, without refueling. rook76 / Shutterstock.comCarrying an unprecedented 3,150 of fuel it took the ‘Voyager’ nine days, three minutes and 44 seconds to become the first aircraft to circumnavigate the globe nonstop, without refuelling. The ‘Voyager’ landed again at the Edwards Air Force Base on December 23, 1987.Did I say finally? Sorry, there was just one more record waiting to be broken. In 1964, Geraldine ‘Jerri’ Mock set a record by being the first women to fly solo around the world in her single-engine Cessna 180 aptly called the Spirit of Columbus.",

    "title": "When will the Oceans of the Earth Overflow?",
    "article": "Try this out. Plug the sink and leave the water running. It will lead to a flood in the bathroom and a scolding for letting the water overflow. Since the sink could not hold an unlimited amount of water, it let the water spill out.But even the oceans are enormous bodies of water that get flooded with water from rain, melting ice, and rivers year after year. Will they start overflowing too? If so, when? And, where will they go?The answer is, never. Despite the deluge of water, our oceans will never overflow.The reason lies in the earth’s water circulation system, also known as the hydrologic cycle.Earth is known as “the water planet”. Seventy percent of its surface is made up of water – it amounts to a staggering 1.36 billion metric tones. It covers an area that is nine times larger than the Moon’s surface. But this water is neither added to, nor subtracted from the planet for the simple reason that it is in constant motion, cycling through the oceans, the air, the land, and back to the oceans again.The oceans contain the bulk of earth’s water – 97.2 percent. Ice caps and glaciers, ground water, atmosphere, rivers, lakes and marshes together make up less than three percent of the earth’s waterThe cycle begins as the sun makes the water evaporate from oceans, lakes, rivers and soil. Transpiration releases more water vapour in the air. Transpiration is the process by which plants extract water from the ground and release it through their leaves. The vapour then condenses as rain or snow, 75 per cent of which falls on the oceans. The remainder pours on the land, river and lakes as rain. Some of the water then seeps into the earth as groundwater, while some is returned to the sea.So, that is why the oceans are never in danger of overflowing.",

    "title": "Where Did Numerals Originate?",
    "article": "We deal with numbers all the time. Not just while doing math lessons at school, but also while counting money at the shop, memorising the numbers of our favourite TV channels or even keeping tabs on the number of hours we spend in front of the Internet! But we are so used to numbers that it has never occurred to us to find out where these numbers come from.For that, we must travel back in time. We must go back to 6th century India. It was around this time, that the great Indian astronomer Aryabhatta invented a set of numerals that is now used by people all over the world.You might already have heard that zero was invented in India. But it is not so widely known that even the other numerals were invented in India only. This is because the figures written as 1, 2, 3 etc. are commonly known as ‘Arabic’.This would naturally make it seem that the number system originated in Arabia and not in India. Sounds rather mysterious no? That something that was invented by an Indian scientist should be known as Arabic? But there’s quite an interesting story behind this.Sometime in the year 771, Arab merchants took some Indian scholars to Baghdad (the present capital of Iraq) to help teach them the new set of numbers. After learning the numbers, the Arabs translated the numbers into their own script that is Arabic. Sometime later, the Arab traders carried a book of these numerals (in their language or script) to Europe, where the numbers were translated into Latin. As the world at large got these numbers from Arabia, these came to be known as Arabic.In fact, it is interesting to note that there is another number system in use. This is the ‘Roman’ numerical system. The numbers in this system are written as I, II, III, IV, V etc. Although this number system is also a well-developed one, there’s one problem in it. Since there is no symbol for zero in it, there is difficulty in carrying out addition, subtraction and other calculations.Let’s take an example. In the Arabic number system the calculation of 2076+600, can be easily computed by arranging the numbers in two vertical columns;However, the same calculation is not so easy, when it comes to the Roman system. Why? Because under the Roman system the numbers are written differently. This is because M means a thousand, D stands for 500, C stands for a hundred, L for fifty, X for ten, V for five and I for one.It is amazing what a big difference the seemingly simple and valueless number ‘0’ can make. The small number ‘1’ can be turned into a million! a billion!! Or even a trillion!!! – Thanks to the magical powers of zero.Where did numerals originate?Here are some more interesting facts. The script of the Arabic language (not mathematical) moves from right to left, unlike English, which moves from left to right. However, Arabic numbers are written from left to right. Why? Because they were borrowed from India!Since the time they were invented, Arabic numerals have undergone only minor changes from the original Hindu manuscript. The numbers that have undergone slight changes include 4, 5, 6 and 7.So that is the “number story” – how numbers were born in India, travelled to Arabia and then to Europe. And now? Well, the whole world is using them all the time. Rather interesting, no?",

    "article": "You can find a piggy bank at almost every home. But whoever heard of pigs and savings? Pigs in a poke, yes, and pigs in a sty. But what is the connection between the sty residents and a home saving bank?Actually none. The connecting link has to do with clay. Clay? Yes. Though coin-slotted money boxes in the shape of animals, including pigs have been in existence for centuries, the actual term came to be associated with Europe in the middle ages.In the 15th and 16th century Europe, there were no banks to put your money into. What money people saved had to kept at home. But people earned so little that they wanted to save some money for a rainy day.Traditional clay piggy-banksThe only way they could was to put it in pots and jars. The jars were mostly made of hardened clay as metal was a costly item then and people couldn’t afford to buy a metal jar. Pots, pans, jars and other household items were made of an orange-coloured clay known as “pygg”.People would use a jar made of “pygg” to save or “bank” what money they could. When banking started, people realised that what they were saving in “pygg” moneyboxes at home was personal banking!Slowly over time, this “pygg bank” became corrupted to become “pig bank”. In the 19th century, potters who had heard the term decided to make a coin-saving moneybox in the shape of a pig.Pigs, in fact, have always been the poor man’s asset. A pig would be fed leftovers and scraps of the table and be fattened for the butcher at the end of the year. In a similar vein, a piggy bank is fed coins left over from the monthly expenses, and at the end smashed to take the saved money out.Within a short time this figurine caught people’s fancy. Fancy pig-shaped money-boxes came into the market in all shapes and sizes, with cute noses, and curly tails. Naturally this caught the attention of the children and the rest is pig-banking history. As you ‘sow’, so shall you reap, as they say. There hasn’t been a better bit of porcine wisdom since.",

    "title": "Where Did Shoes Come From?",
    "article": "Ooh, aah, ouch! People in ancient times must have yelped like this when they walked on rough ground without any shoes on. And it was probably the pain and discomfort that propelled them to cover their feet for protection.Footwear has a history which goes back many thousands of years, and has long been an article of prestige for people in different societies.The earliest footwear, probably made of plaited grass or rawhide held to the foot with thongs was undoubtedly born of the necessity to provide some protection when moving over rough terrain in varying weather conditions.Scientists estimate the first shoes were made from animal skins during the Ice Age (5000,000 years ago). The biggest find of shoes from this period is thought to date back to 8000 BC and belonged to Native Americans in Missouri. Primitive shoes dating back to 3300 BC were discovered in the French Alps.And there still exist examples of footwear from ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Chinese and Vikings. As soon as human society started getting refined and was divided into classes, the rich and influential began distinguishing themselves by the craftsmanship and decoration on their shoes.Early paintings of Pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, around 3000 BC depict Pharaohs followed by their slaves bearing their sandals. The image suggests that in ancient Egypt the sandal was a sign of power and rank.The Greeks in ancient times took good care of their feet as well. They adapted their footwear for every type of activity. The height of the sole and the colour of the shoes indicated the wearer’s social class.Ancient Romans devised military style thongs called ‘caligae’, which enabled their legions to travel the empire on foot. The caligae was a sturdy thick-soled heavy leather sandal. When victorious soldiers returned from war they frequently substituted the bronze nails, which held the caligae together with gold and silver tacks.Even in Ancient China during 2nd century BC, shoes were a sign of status. Peasants wore straw sandals and aristocrats wore turquoise coloured fine cloth slippers sometimes made of silk. Also it was a common practice for the women to bind their feet in small shoes to make them real small. Although the practice was very painful, bound feet were a sign of beauty in ancient China.In India too, we find many references to simple footwear in the oldest of epics, the Ramayana. Lord Rama’s wooden sandals are mentioned prominently but they seemed to have been simple things. A flat wooden base with a toe hold sticking out, what is commonly called a khadau. References to Gautama Buddha also mention him taking off his sandals before leaving behind the life of a prince. That was 2500 years ago, in the fifth century BC.Footwear has figured widely in western mythology, folk stories and superstitions too. The Greek god Mercury wore winged sandals, and there are very few of us who do not remember childhood tales of Puss in Boots, the Seven League Boots, Cinderella and the Old Woman who Lived in a Shoe.Most cultures have stories where shoes play a starring role. No wonder. After all, these humble toe-holders protect us from the pricks and pins of life.",

    "title": "Where Do Penguins Live?",
    "article": "Short, fat and looking as if they were attending a formal dinner dressed in a tuxedo, penguins could easily be mistaken for people from a distance!Penguins are flightless birds found in the southern hemisphere. No, they are NOT found near the North Pole. Scientists feel that these birds became flightless as food was available in plenty. But their food was located underwater so they adapted to the sea with short flipper-like wings.Penguins have short legs and when they want to move fast, they slide on the ice on their bellies. Penguins eat fish and squid and live in large colonies called rookeries. There are 18 penguin species ranging from the smallest, the Little Blue at 40 cm to the Emperor Penguins at 120 cm. Only two species – the Adelie and the Emperor penguin – live in the Antarctic.Penguins are excellent swimmers and this is where they use their wings. These birds use their wings to propel themselves in the water and also take short flights, like hens, out of the water to come on to land. Their dives may last up to 15 minutes and they can reach speeds of 35 kilometres per hour.Penguins are well adapted to the sea and the bitter cold of the southern pole. To keep the water out of their body, they have oily, thickly-packed feathers that also help retain heat. A layer of thick fat protects them from the icy cold.In late September, hundreds of thousands of penguins move to their breeding ground to mate. Each year the same pair of penguins mate. The female lays one or two eggs. Both male and female penguins take care of the eggs. The eggs are clutched tightly with the feet under their soft stomachs.After eight weeks, the eggs hatch and the chick sits on the parents feet, as the ground is still too cold for its bottom! When the chicks are three weeks old, they join a crèche. These crèches are not what you think.A crèche here is a group of penguins huddled together for warmth. A crèche consists of thousands of little chicks taken care of by a few adults. Penguin parents cannot identify their own babies in this crowd of chicks.When the parent arrives with food, it stays outside the crowd and squawks loudly. The chick on hearing the parent’s voice, comes running. Sometimes other hungry chicks, too, follow, but the parents now recognise their chicks by their persistence.During the harsh winter months, adults also huddle in tight groups for warmth. However, if they get too hot they fluff their feathers and hold out their wings.It is mistakenly thought that when in a huddled group, penguins on the outside change places with penguins on the inside after a while. Actually it’s the survival of the fittest. Some penguins have to be on the outside of any group. These are constantly trying to get inside the group for warmth. So it looks as if the group is constantly in motion with members changing places.",

    "title": "Where are the Shaking Minarets?",
    "article": "Among the many architectural marvels of the world, like the leaning tower of Pisa, the whispering gallery at St Paul’s Cathedral at London or the musical pillars of South India, are the astonishing and historical shaking minarets of Ahmedabad, in Gujarat state, India. The minarets are so unique that if one minaret in shaken, the other sympathetically shakes too!Barely a kilometre away from the Ahmedabad city railway station is the Sidi Bashir mosque (Muslim equivalent of a temple) famed for its jhulta minars or shaking minarets (tall tower-like structures, either at the entrance gate or on the four corners).Ahmedabad city was founded by Sultan Ahmed Shah I in 1411. The mosque and its minarets were built in 1461 and are popularly called Siddi Bashir’s mosque, after a favourite slave of the Sultan. However, there is no evidence of Siddi Bashir building the minarets and it is very likely that it was built by an architect Malik Sarang, a nobleman in the court of Sultan Mahmud Shah Begada, ruler of a nearby province.Surprisingly, when the minarets were built, there was no conscious decision made to make it shake! No one even noticed that it shook or leaned at an angle. The first person to notice that the minarets shake was an European Sanskrit scholar, Monier M Williams in the 19th century.He climbed to the top of one of the minarets and leaned against its wall and found that the minaret started to sway slightly as did the other minaret! Terrified that the tower was going to collapse, he hurriedly got down from the see-sawing minaret!Each minaret is three storied tall with delicately carved stone balconies around each storey. These minarets are about 21.34 meters (70 feet) high. If either of the minarets is shaken the other too vibrates after a few seconds. The vibrations at the base of the tower multiply and get transmitted through air tunnels between the two towers.Amazingly, the connecting passageway between the two minarets, however, remains free of any vibration!This shaking feature was quite common to mosques of Ahmedabad city such as the Jami-Masjid amd Bibi-ki-Masjid, too. The mosque at Raj Bibi once had a pair of shaking minarets. This excited the curiosity of the British, who were then ruling India. So they dismantled one minaret to study the secret of its construction and the mystery behind the swinging effect.Perhaps they are all on shaky ground here.However, there is a lot of disagreement over what causes this vibration and only research can throw light on the architectural marvel.Some say that it is a protection against earthquake damage. But no one has verified this theory. Others like The Archaeological Survey of India says that this medieval engineering feat could possibly be attributed to the use of ‘flexible sandstone’ (a construction material) in the foundation.There is no proof supporting these theories. The only thing known is that the minarets were not built with the plan that they would be shaken. This occurred over a period of time.India is one of two countries that boast of this phenomenon. At Isfahan, in Iran, is Menarjonban a historical building located in a village called Karlatan. Here too the minarets sway slightly when leaned upon.",

    "title": "Where did Coffee Originate?",
    "article": "The aroma of coffee beans was one of the earliest smells to intoxicate me as a child – such was its flamboyant richness. That, and the lush sight of frothy white milk becoming creamier as it mixed with the nut-brown coffee decoction, served in steel tumblers, was perfect happiness.It is a memory shared by many Indians living in the southern states, the main coffee growing as well as drinking regions in the country.The pleasure that the beverage gave was so intense that it never occurred to me that coffee could have originated anywhere but in India.Then came Hollywood films. The glass decanter with black coffee that comes to the aid of the harassed hero with a loosened tie or heroine, with cigarette in shaking hands, was a must in every film.That was when a slight doubt arose in my mind as it must have in the minds of audiences the world over: maybe coffee originated in America, for they drank it and filmed it with such style!I have recently come to know that I was wrong on both counts. My childhood memories as well as my impressionable mind had prevented me from actually exploring the coffee trail, as the well-known nutritionist and food historian K.T Achaya has done in his fascinating work, ‘Indian Food Companion: A Historical Companion’.It is said that the earliest coffee plant may have evolved in Ethiopia, and possibly, only the leaves were chewed. About 700 years ago, the coffee plant made its way to Yemen, then southern Arabia.Young Ethiopian woman in traditional clothing preparing coffee while a Man plays on a masenqo. Bluerain / Shutterstock.comArab traders carried the coffee seeds with them. Four hundred years ago, these seeds made their appearance in south Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, and Europe, too. The first plantation in Brazil was set up a little less than 300 years ago, in 1727.There is an amazing story of how coffee started being grown in a big way in India. Around 1720, a pious Muslim, Baba Budan, returned from Mecca with seven coffee seeds.He planted these seeds outside his cave, in the hills of Chikmagalur, in south India (now in Karnataka). It is said that all the coffee plants growing there, descended from the plants that grew out of those seven seeds.Roasting Ethiopian coffee the traditional way.That area as well as the Nilgiri Hills, in the Western Ghats, soon became the centre of the coffee plantation industry in India, led by the British rulers of the time. It continues thus to this day.Hundred years ago, cakes of coffee powder were to be found in villages all over south India. The cakes were added to boiling water, and when the coffee powder settled below, the coffee drink was had with sugar and jaggery.Times change and tastes change. Today, many have coffee for its taste, while some have coffee for the smart image it creates. But for the true coffee drinker, the world is made up of only two kinds of people; those who drink coffee (the chosen ones) and those unfortunate ones who do not.",

    "title": "Where did Jazz Originate?",
    "article": "One has just to blow a note on a sax and your feet start tapping to the rhythm and your body starts swaying to the music. That’s Jazz for you. Ragtime, hip-hop, be bop, cool, blues – the very names make your finger snap and do a Texas two-step, no?Jazz has often been called the only art form to originate in the United States, though even this is not exactly true. Jazz, is a kind of music that was sung or played by the African slaves in the plantations of America. In the 18th and 19th century, Africans were lured or kidnapped from their villages and sold in faraway America as slaves to work in large plantations.After a hard day’s labour, these people would gather together and sing, both to forget their worries and also to teach their children about the land and culture they came from.Different forms of musical notes from various cultures flowed across the Southern United States during the late 1800s. They were part of the cultural baggage that immigrants brought from their countries to the land that was the melting pot of cultures, America.Where did Jazz Originate?Jazz music thus, grew from a combination of African folk music and rhythms, Caribbean and black American music, as Africans have a very strong culture of singing and dancing.Early jazz music was basically the Blues, a soulful and heart-rending composition with simple and repeated harmonies performed by black musicians who had little or no training in Western music.The Blues was especially widespread in the American South. This was because the American South had the largest number of plantations and so also the largest numbers of slaves. Jazz instrumentalists have long exploited the blues as a vehicle for improvisation.Apart from its musical influences from Africa, the Caribbean, Latino rhythms, instruments like the clarinet and the saxophone also influenced the sound of jazz.By the middle of the 19th century, jazz grew in popularity and its sound became influenced by musicians with formal training and classical backgrounds.In the late 1890s a musical style evolved from St Louis called Ragtime. Its popularity quickly spread to other parts of the United States. This music style emphasized on formal composition and was played on the piano. The music was energetic and lively and quite different from the piano concertos associated with Western classical music. Naturally people loved it.From New Orleans in the American South in 1900, came a fuller Jazz, developed and refined by the French Creole. The Creoles are people of Caribbean origin, mainly from Haiti, once a French colony.The city had its own tradition of band music for street parades and this type of jazz was sometimes referred to as classic jazz, traditional jazz, or even Dixieland jazz. (During the American Civil War in 1865, the Union of the North and the Confederacy of the South were divided by the Mason-Dixon line. Since then, the American south is sometimes referred to as Dixieland.).New Orleans was the musical home of some of Jazz music’s greatest composers and players. These included cornetists Buddy Bolden and King Oliver, cornetist and trumpeter Louis Armstrong, pianist Jelly Roll Morton among others.Jazz soon spread from New Orleans to other parts of the country. A New Orleans Jazz band led by Fate Marable played on riverboats plying on the Mississippi River.The earliest Jazz recording was made in 1917 by a New Orleans band called the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. In 1920, Mamie Smith recorded ‘Crazy Blues’. Soon Jazz records were selling faster than could be recorded or produced.At the same time, radio became a popular feature in every home and commercial radio stations featured live performances from New Orleans, St Louis, Chicago and New York city.Jazz was actually widely appreciated as an important art form in Europe even before it gained popularity in the United States. Today, with variations in style and music, musicians from all over the world are making major contributions to jazz music.",

    "title": "Where did the Yo-Yo Originate?",
    "article": "Yo! Man! Know where the yo-yo comes from? No, I am not asking you to name the local toy store. Sorry, let me rephrase it. Gimme its history, guys. You thought the yo-yo was created by Donald Duncan, huh? Forget it! The yo-yo is nearly a millennium old!So, it wasn’t called the yo-yo then. But for want of a better name let’s stick to calling it the yo-yo, okay? Kids all over the world have played with a similar toy. It is believed that the yo-yo originated in China. Ancient Greek kids (500 BC) played with a little spool-like toy and archaeologists have found samples in many other countries including Egypt.What was it like? Early yo-yos were made of wood, metal or even terracotta and decorated with paints. It consists of two discs connected by a small rod between the discs. A piece of string was tied to this rod and the other end was tied to a finger. The disks were rolled up on this string and when released the disk ran up and down this piece of string!Where did the Yo-Yo originate?As simple as that. From China the yo-yo moved to Europe. A 1789 painting of French king Louis XVII shows the four-year-old playing with the toy. Guess what they called it?- ‘incroyable’ and ‘l’emigrette’. By 1791, it spread through to Britain. Here it was called by a French word ‘bandalore’ don’t ask me why! It was called plain and simple ‘disc’ in Greece.It was in the Philippines that the yo-yo came to be called yo-yo! A yo-yo means ‘comeback’ which is what the toy does. In 1920, a smart Filipino, Pedro Flores, found that if he spent a few millions manufacturing this toy, millions would come back through sales. So he moved to the United States and in 1928 began a yo-yo company in California.His yo-yos were unique as they were the first yo-yos that did not have the string tied to the axle. Instead, the string was looped around the axle, allowing the yo-yo to spin or ‘sleep’ at the end of the string permitting the yo-yo to do an infinite number of tricks.In 1929, Flores sold the rights of the yoyo to another smart man, Donald F. Duncan Sr., American businessman and the inventor of the parking meter and the Eskimo Pie ice-cream.Duncan tentatively called it the ‘O-Boy Yo-yo Top’. The rest is yo-yo history. The yo-yo took America by storm and demand for the toy was greater than supply.However, Duncan had competition. In 1932, Duncan filed for and was assigned a trademark for the word ‘yo-yo’. This stymied the competition temporarily and Duncan’s competitors were forced to use terms like ‘come-back’, ‘whirl-a-gig’, etc. for their versions of the yo-yo.In 1946, Duncan moved to Luck, Wisconsin, which was lucky for him for a little while. Luck came to be known as the ‘Yo-Yo capital of the world’. In 1960, plastic yo-yos were introduced. Sales trebled. By 1962, the Duncan company alone sold a record 45 million yo-yos in a country with only 40 million kids.However, Duncan was fighting a losing battle with the trademarked word ‘yo-yo’. In 1965, the Federal Court of Appeals ruled against Duncan’s trademark for the word ‘yo-yo’. The term yo-yo had become so widespread that it was now a permanent part of the language and it no longer only described the toy.Duncan was forced to sell his trademark and name to Flambeau Plastics Company. Today, the Flambeau Plastics Company manufactures and sells eleven different models. However, Duncan was duly recognised for his effort. June 6, Duncan’s birthday, was deemed National Yo-Yo day in his honour.On April 12, 1985, the yo-yo was taken into space by NASA on the Space Shuttle Discovery as part of a project and even tested out.And, although the yo-yo has gone through ups and downs through the ages, its popularity has never gone down for good.",

    "title": "Where does the Pigeon Post Operate?",
    "article": "Among birds, pigeons have a natural and unerring instinct of returning to their nests or homes after long flights. In the early days besides domesticating animals like the horse, dog and cow, people also bred pigeons to carry messages back and forth. These pigeons are called homing pigeons.Racing pigeons have a life span of 15-20 years. A healthy bird can fly stretches upto 1,000 km. Normally the message is tied around the feet of the pigeon in a plastic capsule to protect the paper. Two pigeons are released with the same message, as pigeons are prone to attacks from other birds of prey particularly the hawk.Pigeon post is the use of homing pigeons as messengers due to their natural homing abilities.Legends have it that lovers exchanged notes and messages with the help of these homing pigeons. However, the first recorded instance of a pigeon post was in 1146 A.D. when the Caliph of Baghdad (in Iraq), Sultan Nuruddin used pigeons to carry mail through his kingdom.During World War 1 (1914-18) a homing pigeon of the American army saved a battalion from being captured by the Germans. In India, emperors Chandragupta Maurya (321-297 B.C.) and Asoka were said to have used pigeons couriers.But, the establishment of a regular mail service by Alauddin Khilji (1296 A.D.) and the onset of the postal service with the invention of telegraph and later telecommunications, put an end to all that. Today, we have mobile phones and satellite communication to connect to any part of the globe.However, even in this day and age, the police in Orissa state in India, still use pigeon posts. In 1946, they procured 40 pigeons and trained them on three courses: static, mobile and boomerang.In the static category the pigeons are taken by the squad to remote areas of their territory to communicate with headquarters. In the mobile category, the pigeons are taken to various places of operation.These positions may vary from operation to operation so the pigeons are trained to home in to the headquarters. In the boomerang category, the pigeons are trained to deliver and return with the message.Homing pigeons are however not cheap to maintain. They require a good diet and rooming space. These racing pigeons live on a special diet of shark liver oil mixed with potash dissolved in water.The Orissa police have established regular pigeon posts at Cuttack, Chatrapur, Kendrapara, Sambalpur and Denkanal and these pigeons rose to the occasion in times of emergencies and natural calamities.During the centenary celebrations of the Indian postal service in 1954, the Orissa police pigeons demonstrated their capacity by conveying the message of inauguration from the President of India to the Prime Minister.",

    "title": "Where is the Rare Blind Dolphin Found?",
    "article": "What comes to mind at the mention of Varanasi? The peals of temple bells in this ancient pilgrim town; people performing puja at the ghats and elsewhere; bodies being cremated at the banks of the river Ganga. Do dolphins come to mind?Dolphins?! That happy looking performing artist which looks more like a shiny inflated balloon toy? Yes, and this freshwater dolphin is a rare specie, found in Indian and Pakistan – in the Ganga and in the Indus.That is not to say that this dolphin does not have eyes. It has eyes but no lenses. Thus all that it can see is day and night. Beyond that, the world is an unknown sight to the mammal. Like many other sightless creatures of the animal kingdom, they, too, judge distances through sounds and their echoes.Ten years ago, there were over 6000 dolphins who often gave the grave and sober mood of Varanasi a playful twist with their flips through the air, says a report in ‘Exploring the River Front of My Town’, a beautiful information and activity book produced by well-known Indian theatre personality Feisal Alkazi and Priti Jain.Today, barely 3000 dolphins remain in the Ganga and its tributaries and the reasons are not far to guess. For no river has been talked about so much in recent years for the rising pollution in it than the Ganga.One reason is the increasing level of toxic pesticides in the river into which the water from agricultural fields merges at various points. And farmers have been using greater amounts of pesticides over the years. The pesticides gather in the fat layer of the mammal, leading to a slow death.Volunteers rescue a freshwater dolphin that was stuck at Rohri Canal in Sukkur on the west bank of river Indus in Pakistan. Asianet-Pakistan / Shutterstock.comEarlier, the dolphins would migrate during the breeding season. But since the construction of the Farakka barrage, their journeys have been halted. So they breed less too. A barrage is an artificial dam created to divert the flow of water to new channels.The introduction of nylon nets by fishermen has meant that more and more dolphins are getting caught in them and being killed. Dolphin oil is used by the fishermen as a bait for catfish.The story is not very different in Pakistan either. Earlier, the mammal was lord of a watery territory that stretched across 2,800 km, in the Indus river. Now its home has shrunk to barely 170 km, between two dams.They are hunted creatures here as well, states the report, which has been published by Centre for Environment Education, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.There is a very important fact that is being missed out. The dolphin occupies pride of place or the topmost position in the food chain. Below it are the smaller creatures down to the smallest, all of whom are food for the creature a little bigger than them.As long as the dolphin stays healthy, it is a signal that nothing has disturbed the food chain and the delicate balance in nature is being maintained. It means that the river system and the nearby ecosystem, too, are in good shape.The worry starts when the big boss of the food chain starts showing signs of wasting and dies. It means that something has gone terribly wrong in the environment.It means that we must not be blind to the fate of the “blind” dolphins.",

    "article": "The ‘Tower of Babel’ is a structure that is mentioned in the Bible in the Old Testament in Genesis. The Biblical account describes how the descendants of Noe who migrated from Armenia towards Babylon (in Mesopotamia) decided to build a city and a tower whose architectural excellence would make them famous. But, God caused confusion by confounding their tongues, so that they did not understand each other’s speech. Slowly they moved away from that place and they ceased to build the city.Interestingly, historians and archaeologists (people who study old ruins) have searched for this tower and city, but haven’t found any documentary proof that the tower existed.Tower of Babel (Babylon), a famous painting by Pieter Brueghel the Elder created in 1563.However, there is a reference to this tower of Babel in the ‘History of Berosus’ written by Abydenus. Here, the tower is referred to as being built at Babylon on the banks of the river Euphrates.Most scientists follow the common opinion which identifies the tower of Babel with the ruins of the Birs-Nimrud, in Borsippa, situated on the right bank of the Euphrates outside the city.The tower itself must have resembled similar constructions that have been excavated. Most of these structures are in ruins but they are similar in shape and structure to ancient pyramids of Egypt in that cubic blocks of masonry have been piled one on top of the other to form various stories.An inclined stairway leads from one story to the other. Some of the excavated towers at Ur and Arach (in present day Iraq) are two or three stories tall, while others have six and even seven stories.The similarity to the pyramids is reinforced by the fact that the corners of these towers (sides of the Egyptian pyramids) face the four points of the compass.At its very top is a room that could have been used as a place of worship or as an observatory. Some historians say that nearly every Babylonian city possessed such a tower or ziggurat (a pointed, high memorial).Anyway, irrespective of whether the tower existed or not, the term ‘Tower of Babel’ has now come to signify a confusion of noises all speaking at the same time so that no particular dialogue or sentence is decipherable.",

    "article": "Are you a twin? And if so, are you a “double” too? Then Ohio, United States is the place for you to be for an August weekend of twin fun. Every year, in August, twins from all over the world gather at Twinsburg, Ohio, for a special day dedicated to twins and for a weekend of socialising, celebration and fun?The Twins Days festival at Twinsburg is the world’s largest annual gathering of twins. It’s a big club-like event in which twins, “doubles”, triplets, quadruplets and their parents come to this small town near Cleveland.The first Twins Day was held in August 1976 with only 37 pairs of twins. Since then, this festival has been held without fail, drawing record duos from every corner of the globe. It was in fact a coincidence that the city chosen for this festive day was called Twinsburg.Twins are children born of the same mother and within minutes of each other. A woman having one baby at a time is most common. Twins are not so common. On rarer occasions, three babies or triplets, or four babies called quadruplets may be born.How do twins form? Each baby grows from a single cell. Sometimes the cell splits into two. Or sometimes two cells begin to grow. When this happens two babies grow inside the mother. Two babies growing at the same time inside the mother are called twins.Twins that come from one cell that splits into two will look alike. These twins are called identical twins or “doubles”. Twins that come from two different cells will not look alike and are called “fraternal twins”. Twins that look alike are always either two boys or two girls. A fraternal twin may look like each other but are not exactly the same.Portrait of two little girl twinsMost twins do not look alike. Identical twins or doubles is a rare phenomenon. The Twin Day festival was thus organised to recognise this biological miracle.In 1976, the year the United States celebrated 200 years of independence, a group of people decided to set aside a day for twins.Since July was the month dedicated for the celebrations (July 4 is United States’ Independence day) August was chosen to celebrate the festival.The Twins Day Festival in August 1976 started with a flag hoisting at the city square. There were 37 sets of twins in attendance that first year.The organisers did not want the festival to be a one-off affair. So the next year they planned it better and ensured the festival continued at the same venue.There were heated arguments whether Twins Day should be limited to a local affair or to a festival dedicated to children of multiple births. In 1979 the festival went international with two sets of twins arriving from abroad – one pair from Lebanon and another from Poland. The same year, the Twins Day Committee was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation.Today, the Twins Day attracts 2,736 pairs of twins from every state in the USA and others from all over the globe. From baby twins to people in the eighties and nineties!You can attend too if you are interested – if not to participate at least as a spectator. However, if you are unable to attend the Twins Day festival, you must at least check out Twins Restaurant in New York city operated by Debbie and Lisa Ganz. The entire restaurant is staffed by multiples!",

    "title": "Which Film Stars were Inventors Too?",
    "article": "Most movie fans have seen or at least heard of Hollywood legends Hedy Lamarr and Steve McQueen. But how many know that these two were inventors who have significantly changed our lives. Nobody? Not surprising.But it’s true. Hedy Lamarr and Steve McQueen were both Hollywood stars and inventors. Hedy Lamarr thought of torpedoes guided by radio signals and Steve McQueen invented the bucket seat that has revolutionised the automobile industry.However, Hedy’s invention was never used for the purpose invented. Instead it is now used in satellite communications today.Hedy was born Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler on November 9, 1914 in Vienna, Austria. Best known for Hollywood director Mel Brooks “cowboy” film parody ‘Blazing Saddles’, she started her movie career at 17 when she was discovered by Max Reinhardt. Among her first films was the 1931, German film ‘Die Koffer des Herrn O.F.’ (The Suitcases of Mr. O.F.).In 1933, she married Friedrich (Fritz) Mandl, an arms dealer. Being exposed to weapons and weaponry, she came up with the idea of a radio-controlled torpedo. She soon learned that radio signals could be easily jammed and dropped the idea.In 1937, Hedy left Austria and her husband to shift to America, like many artists who were becoming uncomfortable in Adolf Hitler’s Germany with its increasing shades of Naziism.On the ship Normandie, she met Louis B. Mayer who signed her for a seven-year contract with MGM and she changed her name to Hedy Lamarr in memory of the silent screen actress Barbara La Marr.When World War II was declared in 1939, Hedy again brought up the subject of a radio-controlled torpedo. She suggested the idea to music composer George Antheil.Hedy Lamarr invented and filed a patent the radio-controlled torpedo.They realised that if they were able to change the radio signal frequency at random intervals (called frequency hopping) the the signals could not be jammed and torpedo would work. In June 1941 they filed a patent for their invention.Unfortunately the patent expired in 1959 without anyone making any use of it. It was ironic that the U.S. military simply let the patent languish. It was only in 1997 that the invention was formally acknowledged.Instead of “frequency hopping”, the term used today is “spread spectrum” which was tested to make cellular phone calls more secure from eavesdroppers.Unfortunately for Lamarr, who could use some of that money, the patent expired long ago.Steve McQueen’s life is a rags to riches story. Born in Beech Grove, Indiana, on 24 March 1930, Steve was the product of a broken home. Coming into the movies, Steve McQueen became one of the most popular stars and basked in the adulation of his fans.Though born in Indiana, Steve was raised by his great-granduncle in rural Missouri. In his early teens his family moved to Los Angeles, where Steve drifted into petty crime. He was arrested for stealing hubcaps from cars and sent to reform school – the Boys’ Republic in Chino, California. Reform school really straightened McQueen out.McQueen drifted to Hollywood and eventually to films where he hit stardom. He is credited with being one of the best actors in Hollywood history and his films are considered classics.Acting in films such as ‘The Great Escape’, ‘The Sand Pebbles’, (for which he received an Academy Award nomination), ‘The Thomas Crown Affair’, ‘The Magnificent Seven’ and ‘Papillon’ among others, McQueen loved to play characters who had a secret sorrow in life that made them different from others — more a reflection of his childhood.McQueen, like other film stars James Dean and Paul Newman, was addicted to living in the fast lane. He was well known as a racing car driver and loved to race and tinker with engines on and off camera. Initially McQueen even contemplated the idea of designing clothing accessories for auto racers and motorcycle racers.A motoring enthusiast he found racing cars had poorly designed seats leading to driving problems. Racers were fidgeting in their seats, craning their necks and hurting their back instead of relaxing and being comfortable. So he designed a seat, which took the shape of the human back.On December 8, 1969, he filed for patent for the invention of the bucket seat. The bucket seat took the auto world by storm. Today, it is the basis for almost all roadsters and grand prix machines on the racetrack and on city roads.",

The most famous and the brightest of these is the M31 or the Andromeda galaxy.The spiral galaxyAndromeda galaxy is visible to the eyeThe Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million light years away, simply put light takes 2.5 million years to travel from Andromeda to earth. It is believed that Andromeda has about 400 billion stars. This makes it almost twice as big as our Milky Way.The Andromeda galaxy is spiral in shape, and like other spiral galaxies, it is a giant pinwheel of stars, gas and dust. And it has two smaller satellite galaxies quite like the way the moon is a satellite of the earth.A Persian astronomer named Al-Sufi described it in his Book of Fixed Stars in 964 AD as the ‘little cloud’. Indeed! If you are able to spot it on a clear night, it does look like a tiny cloud. Andromeda was rediscovered in 1612 after the invention of the telescope by the German astronomer, Simon Marius.For centuries, the Andromeda galaxy was thought to be a part of the Milky Way. It was only in the 1920s that Edwin Hubble a famous astrophysicist, determined conclusively that the Andromeda was indeed a galaxy.A celestial collisonScientists say that all the galaxies are racing away from each other. But the Milky Way is actually racing towards the Andromeda galaxy. And the enormous gap between the Milky Way and Andromeda is closing at about 500,000 kilometers an hour. This pace will quicken as the two galaxies near each other.John Dubinski, professor of astronomy at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics points out that the two galaxies are actually on a collision course. They may collide almost three billion years later.",

    "title": "Which Insects Live the Longest?",
    "article": "Take a look around. Which insects do you see? A fly sitting on your computer screen, a mosquito buzzing in your ear just as you drop off to sleep, a butterfly flitting about in the garden outside, or how about the ants that made off with the remains of a dead moth?Most of the insects we see around us have rather short lives. A few hours, a few days, that’s about how long most insects last. We don’t notice them dying out because they’re promptly replaced by a new bunch. Yet, some insects live comparatively really long lives.The longest living insects are the Splendour beetles (Buprestidae), some of which remain in the larva stage for more than 30 years. Queen termites (Isoptera), previously thought to live 10 years or more, are now known to have a maximum life span of about 15 years.Apart from these two insects, the Cicada actually lives for 17 years. The lifecycle of the ‘music-making’ Cicada is very interesting. The female Cicada lays eggs in the twigs of trees. When the young one (nymph) is hatched from the egg, it drops down to the ground.Then it burrows itself into the ground and attaches itself to the roots of plants and trees. Here it remains motionless for about 17 years, sucking at the sap of the roots. After this long ‘burial’, it is driven by some mysterious instinct to move out towards the light. It climbs the tree trunks and its skin splits open. The mature Cicada emerges.A termite queen can live for 45 yearsFor about five weeks, the Cicada leads an active life in sunlight. After this period it just dies. It spends 17 years buried under a tree for just five weeks of active life!The male Cicada makes a shrill sound, which can be heard in the countryside. This is probably a mating call to the females. According to scientists, the noise-producing organs of the Cicada are probably the most complicated musical organs found in nature. The male Cicada has little drum-like plates, which constantly vibrate by muscles that never seem to tire.There are more than 800 species of Cicada, 100 of which are found in North America. The 17-year Cicada is found only in the United States. Most of the other species live only for two years.",

    "article": "Mammals are creatures who give birth to their young ones as opposed to other animals who lay eggs. Birds, reptiles and insects lay eggs. But as with every other rule, this one has exceptions* too.An exceptional exceptionThe duck-billed platypus of Australia walks out of fresh waters to build its nest on the ground. But it has retained its love of water and returns to streams and ponds to eat crayfish, snails, and shrimp. The most remarkable feature in the platypus is that although it is a mammal, it lays eggs!Which Mammal lays Eggs? Buck-billed Platypus of AustraliaIn fact, it seems the duck-billed platypus is like a fairy tale creature. Legend has it that when the platypus was first discovered, it was stuffed and sent to England for research. And, at first, the scientists thought it was a joke! They thought someone had glued the bill and feet of a duck onto the body of a beaver!But actually, the platypus and its cousin, the anteater, along with other marsupials like kangaroos, make up the most primitive group of living mammals on earth.The platypus is semi-aquatic as it can stay both in the water and out of it. Its most distinctive feature is its bill, shaped like that of a duck’s. No wonder it is called ‘duck-billed’. The platypus’s head, trunk, and tail are covered with brown fur, which is thick and water proof.Its fur allows it to swim in waters as cold as zero degrees Celsius. It digs a burrow in the ground, where it builds its nest. Its strong shoulder muscles help it dig these burrows.So, that is the platypus’s tale. A bill like a duck’s, a body like a lizard’s and a lifestyle like most mammals. Isn’t that fascinating?*Duck-billed platypus is not the only animal that lays eggs.To be fair duck-billed platypus is not the only animal that lays eggs. There are only five living monotreme species: the duck-billed platypus and four species of echidna (also known as spiny anteaters). ‘Monotreme’ is the technical name for egg-laying mammals.",

    "article": "Did you know that in India, mango orchards cover roughly 33 percent (1.08 million hectares) of the total area under fruit cultivation? In a hectare of land you can grow thousands of trees. And each tree bears, thousands of fruit! I will leave it to you to calculate how many mangoes the country produces! It’s no wonder that the subzi mandis (vegetable and fruit markets) get flooded with mangoes in summers.Forget the fact that the country produces millions of mangoes, do you know how many varieties there are? Thousands! Some of the popular ones are Alphonso, Dassehri, Banganapalle, Langra, Safeda, Neelam and Chausa. With so many varieties in the country, people have created varieties with fancy and romantic names, like Husn-e-Ara and Jehangir.Mango orchards cover roughly 33% of the total area under fruit cultivation in India making it abundant fruit in the country.The different varieties are also due to experiments in grafting where a bit of the stem of one variety is cut and another variety is placed over it. It is exactly like breaking a bone and the doctor sets it right by putting splints and tying it up.The first such experiment on mango breeding was carried out in 1911 by two biologists, Burns and Prayag. Their purpose was to develop varieties possessing regular fruit-bearing habits, good fruit quality, and a good yield that is disease resistant.The most commercially viable variety today is the Alphonso and Dassehri varieties. The Alphonso originated in Ratnagiri district in the state of Maharashtra while the Dassehri from village Dassehri near Malihabad in the state of Uttar Pradesh. A 150-year-old ‘mother tree’ is found here, said to be one of the oldest and first in the line of Dassehri trees.Malihabad near Lucknow is more famous for another reason. Hazi Kaleemullah Khan has an 80-year-old mango tree that bears 315 different varieties of mango. All in one tree! Now that’s what one calls fruitful!In a period of 10 years Khan managed to graft 315 varieties ranging from Tota to Alphonso. The diverse varieties also protect the tree from being infected by mango diseases, which are mainly variety specific.Can you envisage 315 varieties in a single tree? Perhaps not, but you can certainly see most of it if you visit the International Mango Festival that takes place in New Delhi every year. Every variety big and small is displayed for your viewing pleasure.And when I mean big and small I mean it literally. They range from fruit weighing two kilogram each to the smallest at two gram. And if the sight of these juicy fruits makes your mouth water, you can also try them out and enjoy the pulpy flesh as the juices flow down your hand, for that’s how kids really enjoy eating this fruit.",

    "article": "The oldest living creature in the world will come as a surprise to you. Many of the animals in the seas, skies, and earth live long lives. Yet the oldest living creature in the world is an immortal jellyfish that has never died. Its family name is Turritopsis Dohrnii. It hails from a class of small animals that live mainly in saltwater.The Dohrnii begin their life journey as larvae with a diameter of no more than 4 millimeters. The larvae have a tiny vase-shaped body with a mouth surrounded by tentacles. They come together and attach themselves to the ocean floor. Soon, they mature into jellyfish. Once they mature, they travel great distances and hunt other fish for food. The Dohrnii has currently spread across three continents by hitchhiking on the underside of cargo ships. Due to their tiny size, the countries they are invading are unaware that it is even happening.Turritopsis dohrnii medusa Source : Bachware / CC BY-SA 3.0 ]When a Dohrnii jellyfish is exposed to shock, these marvelous creatures reverse their aging process and slowly turn back into larvae, to be reborn again when the danger has passed. It is the only biological example of true immortality. Turritopsis Dohrnii achieves this through a process that is quite remarkable. The cells of the larvae get assigned roles before maturing. The roles are assigned by a tiny strand of genetic material called MiRNA. MiRNA decides which jobs a mature cell receives. When the jellyfish receives a shock, MiRNA begins converting the jellyfish cells back into larvae. Scientists are studying this to see if it can be used to reverse the aging process in other species.The biggest danger to these immortal jellyfish comes from sea plankton, which eats them for survival. Dohrnii are hard to study because of their size and are hard to keep alive in captivity. Today, only one scientist, Shin Kubota from Japan University, has managed to keep them alive. The Dohrnii jellyfish provides the only known method for a living being to cheat death and its secrets are yet to be fully uncovered.Honorary mentions:Greenland Shark: Oldest recorded - 400 yearsBowhead Whale: Oldest recorded - 211 yearsGalapagos Giant Tortoise: Oldest recorded - 152 yearsAfrican Elephant: Oldest recorded - 86",

    "title": "Which is the World's Oldest Working Locomotive?",
    "article": "The Indian Railways is one of the world’s oldest railways dating back to 1849. It also has the largest network in terms of route length covering nearly 63,000 route kilometres touching every nook and cranny of India. The Indian Railways is also the world’s single largest employer with about 1.6 million people working in nine zones.Among its many unique gems are the toy train that runs on the Darjeeling Himalayan rail route, the rack railway at Udagamandalam in south India, the busiest narrow gauge network in the world, etc. However, the pride of place goes to the ‘Fairy Queen’, a living locomotive legend. So what’s so special about it? Well, it is the world’s oldest locomotive still in operation on a main line transporting tourists from Delhi to Alwar in Rajasthan.Looking at the ‘Fairy Queen’ you cannot guess that it is nearly 145 years old, as she was first commissioned way back in 1855!The Fairy Queen was built by the British firm Kitson, Thomson and Hewitson of Leeds to run on a broad gauge track (5 foot 6 inches). Weighing all of 26 tonnes, the locomotive was a type 2-2-2 WT (under slung water tank) with a double plate frame and its original maker number was 481.In 1855, she was delivered to the East Indian Railways (EIR), the company that pioneered railway network in India, and renamed EIR 22. The East Indian Railways used the locomotive to haul mail trains between Howrah and Raniganj in West Bengal state. This distance of 121 miles was covered at a leisurely pace of 25 miles per hour taking 5 hours in all.In 1857, she was put into troop transportation during the first Indian war of Independence. In 1881, her number was changed to 92 and she was renumbered 101 in 1884. In 1895 she was finally named ‘Fairy Queen’.The Fairy Queen ended her working life in 1909 as a construction engine on the Bihar (a state in India) lines. The same year she was withdrawn from service and placed outside Howrah station in Calcutta where she made her debut.From 1909 to 1943 she stayed there and she was then shifted to the Zonal training School at Chandausi. In 1973, she came to Delhi during the inauguration of the Rail Transport Museum.However, till 1997, she still could not claim the title of the oldest working locomotive as another engine, the ‘Tweed’, built by Dubs of Glasgow, Scotland in 1873 was regularly chugging and wheezing at Sarayu Sugar Mills, in Gorakhpur, in the state of Uttar Pradesh.But Fairy Queen refused to be an ‘also ran’ and be relegated to the railway archives. The Indian Railways decided to restore the engine to working condition more as a tourist attraction for steam engine enthusiasts, India is among a handful of countries that still operate coal and steam engines.In 1996, the Fairy Queen was restored at the railway yards at Perumbur in Chennai. On October 31, 1998, she was pressed into action to ply on select days between Delhi and Alwar, a distance of 143 kilometres.Pulling a two-bogie train the locomotive regally chugs out of Delhi Cantonment station, working to a fever pitch of a maximum speed of 40 kilometres per hour. And the grand centenarian that she is, she stops six times in between to get her breath back and of course to stock up on water and coal.Though we said restoration, nothing needed to be restored as everything in the locomotive is still original and in pristine condition – the copper boiler furnace as well as the steam regulator and a blast from the old whistle never fails to bring people young and old alike to stand and gape and wave wildly as the locomotive chugs merrily by the Indian countryside.",

    "title": "Which is the fastest animal on earth?",
    "article": "Peregrine Falcon is the fastest animal on earth – it can fly nearly as fast as an airplane.Peregrine Falcon is one of the rare birds that thrive in urban environments. It uses tall skyscrapers as launchpads and hunts pigeons and ducks. It is the world’s most widespread bird of prey and one of the most widely found bird species. It also has a good relationship with humans who use it for hunting.Known as the Duck Hawk in North America, it is a falcon. It has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black colored head. The Duck Hawk is known for its speed. The fastest recorded speed it has reached is 389 km/h (242 m/h). It uses this speed while hunting, flying high above its prey and swooping down at a frightening pace.Hunting at such a speed is no small feat and its vision has evolved to help it. Peregrine Falcons have the highest visual processing speed of any animal. Human beings, for example, can register about 24 images per second. Any faster than that and the human eye can not see the individual images but continuous motion, like a film. Incidentally, this is perhaps the reason why historically films were shot at 24 frames per second. The peregrine, however, can register up to 129 images in a second as individual images. This is how it keeps a precise eye on its prey even at 389 km/hr.Adult of subspecies pealei or tundrius by its nest in AlaskaThe Peregrine has evolved to deal with high speed. It has special nostrils that regulate airflow. Without these, at such a speed, the intake of air could hurt its lungs. It has three eyelids that clear away debris and protect its eyes from the air pressure. Once it spots its prey, it tucks its wings and tail and begins a rapid dive. It clips its prey, usually on the wing to protect itself against the shock of impact. This usually kills its prey, at which point the Peregrine continues its descent, turns in mid-air, and catches its prey with its legs. It is truly a sight to behold. If the prey is too big to carry, it will let it fall and eat it there.During the 19th century, the Peregrine nearly became extinct. They were killed to protect messenger pigeons. The human pesticide DDT also prevented them from having chicks. After various conservation attempts, the number of Peregrine Falcons has revived. Since 1955 they have been a protected species and have received various honors. It is the national bird of the United Arab Emirates and the state bird of Chicago, USA.",

    "article": "How many times have you been told not to read in bed and how often have you been ticked off for reading in poor light? Probably quite a few times if you are an avid book-worm. Now you can cast away your small flashlights and get rid of your reading lamp, for there are specially designed books that create their own light!The glowing bookProfessor Janos Hajto of Napier University, Edinburgh, has created a book with special plastic sheets that glow in the dark. He calls his invention ‘Freelight’.Freelight uses a concept similar to “glow-in-the-dark” toys, but is much more powerful. The pages of the book have been created after adding a light-emitting dye to thin plastic sheets. The dye makes the pages glow in dark and enables you to read this book even when the lights are off.A glowing dyeSo how does this dye glow? Certain materials can absorb energy and emit it in the form of light. If the interval between absorption and emission is short (within a second or two, as in tubelights) this process is called fluorescence; if the interval is slightly longer, the process is called phosphorescence. Freelight uses phosphorescence to create its own lightIn a Freelight, the dye absorbs light from the environment and re-emits it after a while.Unlike solar panels, which rely on direct sunshine, Freelight absorbs enough energy even on a dull day. Professor Hajto points out that since Freelight does not use electricity, it could be an economical way not just to light up books but to illuminate entire streets, computer screens and hoardings!For once, no one can complain that the light is not bright enough for reading!",

    "article": "What happens when you have a small wound? Just apply a small piece of sticky plaster with gauze (a loosely-woven cotton surgical dressing), or band-aid on it for a few days, and ta-da, your wound is healed!What a stupendous item this band-aid is! So ideal for accident prone people, whether adults or kids. Well it was exactly for this reason that Earle Dickson invented it. He did it for his wife, who though not into rough contact sports was nevertheless accident prone.Earle Dickson was an employee of the American company producing baby and surgical products, Johnson & Johnson. Although the band-aid was Earle’s invention, the company image has overshadowed the inventor.Who Invented Band-aid?In the 1860’s, British surgeon Sir Joseph Lister pioneered sanitary operating room procedures. During those days, surgery was done with bare hands. People were even allowed to observe the operations. Instruments were not sterilized – only washed with soap and water.Lister came to America and lectured on the need for sanitation to prevent germs and bacteria from attacking the human body. Robert Johnson, a chemist from Brooklyn, New York was impressed by this talk and he and his brothers decided to produce safe sanitary equipment for surgical purposes. They set up a company called Johnson & Johnson.In 1920, the company launched a dry gauze dressing that remained sterile in germ-resistant packaging and a baby powder to help new-born babies from getting rashes and sores.Earle Dickson was an employee at Johnson & Johnson. His wife was very accident prone, always cutting and bruising herself. Earle found the company’s large dressing too cumbersome to fix the numerous cuts and bruises. And so he cut the large bandages and affixed smaller pieces of the gauze on surgical tape.The bandage was less cumbersome and easier to handle. Encouraged, he took the idea to the Johnson brothers who realised the market potential of the product.The first band-aids were handmade and quite large: 18 inches long and two-and-a-half inches wide. But initial market reaction was negative and the product wouldn’t move across the counter. The company then revamped the product by cutting down to a more suitable size and introduced it in a new package in 1924. And sales skyrocketed.However, Earle Dickson the inventor, was not totally ignored. Johnson & Johnson made him a vice president, and later gave him a seat on the board of directors.Today, Band-Aid (a registered trademark) sales exceeds $30,000,000 per year and production is in excess of one hundred billion. And it’s all thanks to an accident-prone woman, and a man who stuck some gauze on a tape!",

    "article": "The history of writing instruments with which humans have recorded and conveyed thoughts, feelings and grocery lists, is the history of civilisation itself. This is how we know about our ancestors and their lives.The handy sharpened-stone, used for skinning and killing animals was adapted into the first writing instrument. Around 24,000 BC, the cave man started drawing pictures with the stone onto the walls of his cave dwelling. His drawings showed events in daily life such as the planting of crops or hunting victories. Walls at the Apollo site in Namibia, southwest Africa are believed to be the oldest rock paintings to date.Before paper came along, people used clay or wax tablets on which they wrote using sharp objects such as metal sticks or bones.Around 6000 years ago, in 4000 BC, the Egyptians invented the first substance like paper called papyrus. It was a woven mat of reeds, pounded together into a hard, thin sheet. The word ‘paper’ actually comes from the word ‘papyrus’. Ancient Greeks are also known to have used a kind of parchment made from animal skins for the same purpose.Who Invented The Pen?Now something was needed to write upon the parchment or the papyrus. Bones or metal sticks were no longer useful as the papyrus could not be scratched. So the Egyptians created a reed-pen perfect for the papyrus. These were mostly the hollow tubular-stems of marsh grasses, especially from the bamboo plant. And thus, ancient Egyptians converted bamboo stems into a primitive form of a fountain pen. They cut one end into the form of a pen nib or point. A writing fluid or ink filled the stem and the reed forced the fluid to the nib.Another writing instrument that remained active in history for a long period was the quill pen. Introduced around 1300 years ago in 700 AD, the quill was a pen made from a bird feather. The five outer left wing feathers were plucked from the birds in the spring season. The left wing was chosen because the feathers curved outward and remained away when used by a right-handed writer. Goose feathers were most common, swan feathers were of a high quality, being scarce and most expensive. For making fine line drawings, crow feathers were the best, then came the feathers of the eagle, owl, hawk and turkey.Quill pens lasted for only a week before it was necessary to replace them. There were other disadvantages associated with their use, including a lengthy preparation time.When writers had better inks and paper and handwriting had developed into both an art form and an everyday occurrence, man’s inventive nature once again turned to improving the writing instrument. This led to the development of the modern fountain pen in the 19th century.",

    "title": "Who Invented Traffic Lights?",
    "article": "Long before roads needed traffic lights, railways were using a system of signals to control train traffic. In the early railways, a single track was used for both up-going and down-going trains, and safety depended on spacing the arrival and departure of trains according to time intervals.These signals consisted of a ball and something that looked like a kite. When the kite was raised on top it indicated danger while if the ball was raised, it indicated the all clear.In 1841, the first semaphore (visual form of signalling) railway signal was installed at London station. This consisted of a signal arm in a horizontal position to express ‘stop’. If lowered to 45 degrees it urged the engine driver to proceed with caution and if pointed vertically skyward it indicated the track was clear. The signals were painted red as it was easy to identify and attract the driver’s attention.At night, oil lamps were added on top of these poles and a red light indicated ‘stop’ while a white light indicated that the driver could proceed.However, the white coloured light proved disastrous as it stood for both ‘the all clear’ and ‘warning indications’ and so resulted in many accidents.In January 1876, the engine driver of the Flying Scotsman, an express train, rammed into a freight train running ahead on the same track because of the confusion in the signals. The derailment blocked the track in the opposite direction. This caused a major accident as the Manchester express train, which was running on this track, crashed into the already derailed bogies, killing 13 people and seriously injuring 24 others.Following this disastrous accident, the signal system was modified. First, the normally displayed indication for ‘stop’ became red while an additional yellow light was added to indicate to the driver to proceed with caution. In 1893, green lights replaced the white light to avoid confusion as street lighting and house lighting hampered the driver from reading the signal rightly.Since railway signalling was introduced, civic officials decided to try it out in the congested streets of London. Thus, even before the advent of motorcars, traffic lights were introduced in 1868 in London to control the flow of horse buggies, wagons and pedestrians.This signal was a revolving lantern with red and green signals. Red meant ‘stop’ and green meant ‘caution’. The lantern was lit by gas and turned up by means of a lever at its base so that the appropriate light faced the traffic.But in an unfortunate incident this traffic light exploded, on January 2, 1869, injuring the policeman who was operating it.With automobiles being introduced in America and Britain the traffic situation was getting problematic. A police officer called William Potts of Detroit, Michigan, decided to do something about the problem and he decided to adapt railroad signals for street use.His real problem was that rail traffic ran along one way while traffic flow at intersections ran at right angles and were four-way.Nevertheless, he used two-coloured lights, red and green, and connected the signals by electricity. The first traffic light was thus installed in 1920 on the corner of Woodward and Michigan Avenues in Detroit.But these lights were manually operated and were still two-way lights. At about the same time, Garrett Augustus Morgan Sr., an African-American, from Cleveland, Ohio, realized the need for traffic lights after seeing a collision between an automobile and a horse-drawn carriage.Distressed by the accident he decided to do something about it and on November 20, 1923 patented the four-way traffic light signal.Who Invented Traffic Lights?Today, traffic lights have an internal timer that is programmed to stay on for a specific amount of time. Policemen also control the lights on certain roads depending on the amount of traffic.Morgan’s invention has indeed saved many thousands of lives and created vehicular order among chaos. So next time you wait at a red light, Relax, and thank Garrett Augustus Morgan for his invention.",

Soon it becomes clear that the “spacecraft” is actually a harmless toy — a colourful Frisbee, and the creature from outer space is the boy next door!Today, almost all of us have seen one or sent a Frisbee gliding through air. We have seen dogs chase it and leap to catch these flying discs. The toy has proved enormously popular and there are Frisbee throwing competitions held in America.Who Invented the Frisbee?The flying disc was named Frisbee after a 19th century Connecticut Yankee called William Russell Frisbie, a baker by profession. In 1871, he was hired to manage a branch of the Olds Baking Company.He soon bought it outright and named it the Frisbie Pie Company. It offered a variety of baked goodies, including pies and cookies.The pies and cookies were packed in round tin containers and sold to the students of Yale University, nearby. After eating the pies, the students would have fun tossing the round tins in air.The tin throwing craze would have died but for the shrewd sense of one man: Walter Frederick Morrison from Utah. Morrison had served in the World War II.Like many people during the 1930s and 1940s, who claimed to have seen blinking lights and flying saucer-like objects from outer space, called UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), Morrison, too, was bitten by the UFO bug.This craze had reached its peak in 1938 when a science fiction story by HG Wells was dramatised on radio by an actor called Orson Welles.Called the ‘War of the Worlds’ the radio play, aired in New York, made the fiction seem a reality by announcing that little green men from planet Mars had indeed invaded the earth. Listeners who did not know that it was a play thought it was the latest news and ran out in the streets in fear.Morrison was smart enough to think of cashing in on this flying saucer craze. He took lids of cans and welded a steel ring inside the rim to improve the plate’s stability. But this wasn’t very successful.In 1951, Morrison improved upon his model and the design. As it was to look like an UFO, he redesigned it with small portholes to give it a realistic touch.In California, Rich Knerr and A.K. Melin, who had started a little toy company called Wham-O saw Morrison’s flying saucers being flown on the beaches. In 1955, they bought over Morrison’s flying saucer.In 1957, the company introduced it in the market under the name Pluto Platter, inspired no doubt by the UFO craze. In 1958, while on a trip to Yale, Knerr heard the words “Frisbie” and “Frisbie-ing” as well as the story of Yale college students throwing pie tins. Therefore he decided to call Pluto Platter by the new name of Frisbie.Frisbie, thus became a registered trademark for the plastic disc.The Frisbee has glided a long way from its pie-tin days. Today it is a fun game played by millions. To have fun, the toy just needs two arms – one to throw and one to catch, not necessarily your own.",

    "title": "Who Invented the Photocopying Machine?",
    "article": "We have all used it at one time or another to copy our school documents, or parts of a book borrowed from the library, or just about anything we wanted a copy of. It’s just a matter of pressing a button of the xerox machine and hey Presto! a piece of paper comes out at one end, an exact duplicate of the document we needed copied!However, when the invention was first patented, nobody wanted anything to do with it. Major corporations like IBM, Kodak and General Electric rejected the offer to develop it, perhaps regretting the decision to this day! However, the blood, sweat, and tears of its inventor, Chester F. Carlson did not go wasted, as the success of the machine proves today!Chester Carlson, the inventor of this machine was born on February 8, 1906 in Seattle but grew up in California. In 1930, he received his degree in Physics from California Institute of Technology.Chester Carlson invented photocopying. catwalker / Shutterstock.comHowever, it was the depression era and there were no jobs available. Ultimately Carlson got a job at P. R. Mallory in New York city, a battery manufacturing company. During this time, Carlson studied law at night school and ensured a somewhat steady job at Mallory in their patents department as a patents ‘lawyer’.Carlson found that each patent had to be copied many times by hand or photographed before it could even be submitted to the patents office. Both methods were tedious and time consuming.This tedium was the root cause for Carlson to invent the much needed photocopier that we take for granted today. Carlson reasoned that there must be a better way to make copies and he decided to find out.He spent months going through various scientific articles but could find no solution. He reasoned that the answer lay in the new field of photoconductivity, a field recently discovered by Hungarian physicist Paul Selenyi. He had discovered that when light strikes the surface of certain chemicals or metals, its conductivity (flow of electrons) increases.Carlson realized that if the image of a document or photograph was to be projected onto a photoconductive surface, current would flow only in the areas where the light falls.He worked at his invention from the kitchen of his house and arrived at something he termed ‘electrophotography’. His first patent was applied for in October 1937.In the beginning large corporations did not show any enthusiasm in the project as it would have cost them an initial investment of millions of dollars.At this time Carlson came in contact with Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit organisation that invested in technological research. Battelle promised to help Carlson and signed a deal giving Carlson a 40% share in the proceeds.Battelle assigned the project over to a man named Roland M. Schaffert, a research physicist and a former printer. Schaffert worked on the project for nearly a year. He then improved on Carlson’s technique by using a new photoconductive plate covered with Selenium, a better photoconductor.Battelle researchers also developed a dry ink, which they called a toner. This toner was made of ammonium chloride salt and a plastic material to get a clearer image.On January 2, 1947, Battelle signed an agreement with a small company known as Haloid to manufacture this electrophotograpy technology and the first photocopiers were introduced in the market in 1949.However, the flat plate process was very prolonged and was impractical when making a dozen or more copies. At this time somebody suggested that Haloid use the term xerography for this technology from the Greek words xeros for “dry” and graphos for “writing”. Haloid thus named its first photocopier the XeroX Model A. In 1958, Haloid officially changed their name to Haloid Xerox, and finally to Xerox in 1961.Success didn’t really come to Haloid Xerox until they introduced the Model 914, in 1959. It was called ‘914’ because it could handle paper legal size paper which is 9 inches x 14 inches in size.This was the model that hit it big that by 1965 earned Xerox revenue over $500 million dollars and today Xerox is such a household name that people confuse the name of the company for the process called photocopying!Sometimes we mistakenly say “can I have a Xerox of this document?” don’t we? Now you know why it is wrong to say so !",

    "title": "Who Sold the Eiffel Tower Twice?",
    "article": "There have been conmen and cheats, cardsharps, and crooks but when it comes to deception and trickery few could match the style of international conman Victor Lustig.Victor Lustig was the king of conmen with forty-five known aliases and nearly fifty arrests in the United States alone. He was born in 1890 in Czechoslovakia. Though brilliant as a child, he turned to a life of crime, excelling in gambling, card games and scams.Lustig became a riverside gambler plying the various cruise boats that invariably consisted of the rich and famous. Here he met other experts and under their tutelage fine-tuned his skills.In 1922, Lustig landed in Missouri, USA and decided to lease a farmhouse, which a Missouri bank had reclaimed from its owner for failing to pay back debts to the bank. Assuming the role of a rich Count, Lustig approached the bank with a riches to rags story and how he wanted to settle down and work on a farm.As proof of his intentions, Lustig offered $22,000 in bonds to the bank and also convinced the bank to exchange an additional $10,000 of bonds for cash. The bankers gladly obliged. However, Lustig switched the envelopes and made off with both bonds and cash.The bankers hired a private detective who traced him to New York city. While bringing him back Lustig convinced the bankers that if they did press charges, the negative publicity would cause a run on the bank by its depositors.To top it all, Lustig insisted that the bank give him $1000 for the inconvenience that the arrest had caused him and then coolly walked away with the loot.Lustig then moved to Canada on ‘business’ where he conned another banker into placing bets on ‘sure fire’ wins in horse racing. Having won over the banker’s confidence with a few such wins, Lusting pressed the banker to make a largish bet. Naturally Lustig walked away with the money.The scam that really took the cake was the selling of the Eiffel Tower (Paris’ most famous landmark built in 1889). In 1925, Lustig moved to Europe as both the US and Canadian police were after him. He shifted base to Paris in partnership with another trickster called Dapper Dan Collins.The French government was at that time trying to get the Eiffel Tower repaired. Newspapers covering it also mentioned in passing that the cost of repair were more than the cost of tearing down the tower.Lustig immediately hit upon a terrific scam. He decided that he would sell the rights to tear down the tower. He then went about making elaborate precautions. First, he printed some official looking stationary. Then he sent letters to various scrap iron dealers inviting them to discuss the government contract.During the discussion Lustig announced that the Eiffel Tower was being scrapped as in the last 35 years the steel had rusted. He invited them to submit tenders and bids and also played up on the secrecy part as it could raise a public hue and cry.Lustig had already chosen his victim and informed him that he was winner of the bid. Lustig approached the Frenchman and indirectly hinted that he wanted a bribe before the bid could be approved. The Frenchman gladly offered him the bribe and also the tender money for the sale of the Eiffel tower.Immediately after, Lustig and Dan Collins escaped to nearby Austria. But, the Frenchman, either due to embarrassment or shame never reported the scam and Lustig again came to Paris and sold the Eiffel Tower to another gullible dealer again!However, Lustig’s luck ran out as the victim complained to the police. Lustig was lucky enough to be one jump ahead of the French police.Many were the scams Lustig attempted, like the ‘money’ making machine in which one enters a real note and it duplicates itself. By this time Lustig had joined hands with a forger named William Watts. Soon they were circulating counterfeit US currency in large numbers.In 1934, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) finally caught Lustig with thousands of counterfeit money. Put in the Federal House of Detention in New York city, Lustig however, managed to escape from prison the day before his trial.Recaptured a month later, Lustig was sent to Alcatraz prison, in California in 1935. On March 9, 1947, Lustig contracted pneumonia and died.Victor Lustig made full use of the adage “there’s a sucker born every minute”. Though crime never pays and the criminal is ultimately caught, conmen survive only because when it comes to the thought of making easy money, even the smartest get suckered.Aside: If Victor Lustig was the king of conmen with forty-five known aliases and nearly fifty arrests in the United States alone, Natwarlal or to use his real name, Mithilesh Kumar Shrivastava, was his Indian counterpart. Natwarlal swindled, duped and conned people of over a crore of rupees.",

    "title": "Who discovered Vaccination?",
    "article": "“Mom, I have a stomach ache and I am feeling sick!” Try this out at home and the quick response is bound to be, “Don’t worry, we will take you to the Doctor!” More often than not, if the ache is because you haven’t done your homework, the mere mention of the word ‘doctor’ cures you. Of course, if the problem is genuine no one will know the cure better than a doctor.Edward Jenner was an English physician who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine — the world’s first vaccine. rook76 / Shutterstock.comKnow what the scariest thing about a doctor is? – that invariably you get an injection for all aches and pains. Do you know that a newborn child is given vaccination for many diseases? You may throw a tantrum and scream your head off to avoid the injection and inwardly mutter death threats at the person who invented such a painful method for treatment, but the fact remains that whenever we are sick an injection does the trick.How did it begin? It so happened that one day in 1768, a young milkmaid visited a doctor in Gloucestershire, England. Though nearly everyone in the district was then sick with smallpox, a dreaded disease at that time, the milkmaid was not affected! In the eighteenth century, smallpox was a killer disease, as widespread as cancer now, but with the difference that the majority of its victims were young children.When the doctor asked her the reason, the milkmaid remarked that she had already had cowpox, a disease with symptoms similar to those of smallpox, though in a very mild form. The significance of her remark was not lost on a young medical student, Edward Jenner, who was also present there.Jenner was intrigued by this simple explanation that those who caught cowpox could not catch smallpox. After getting his degree, he returned to Gloucestershire to practice medicine and to devote his spare time in research and investigation. He found out that the milkmaid had been right: people who had cowpox very rarely caught smallpox.On May 14, 1796, another milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes, came to Jenner with cowpox. He conducted a daring experiment. He took some of the virus from the boils on Sarah’s hands and passed on the disease to James Phipps – his gardener’s son – by scratching his skin with infected metal (vaccination). When James had recovered from the cowpox, Jenner tried to give him smallpox. James failed to contract the disease.Edward Jenner had discovered a cure for smallpox! Jenner named this inoculation process, “vaccination”, from the Latin name for cow (vacca) and cowpox (vaccinia).Vaccination at first had many opponents, but eventually its value became firmly established. Today not only has smallpox been nearly wiped out but you can get vaccinated or immunised against many other diseases too! And it is usually performed right from the birth of the child.",

    "article": "Hello, Hullo, Hallo, Hull-oo-oo-oo. You may say it softly or you may holler at the top of your voice, but the person at the other end knows that all you are trying to do is get in touch with a greeting.Legend has it that Thomas Alva Edison was the first to say hello over the telephone. But Edison didn’t invent ‘hello’ by a long shot. As a matter of fact, the greeting has been around for centuries much before the invention of telephone in 1885.In ancient times, people greeted each other with ‘hallow’, which may have come from the Old French word ‘hola’, meaning ‘stop!’ or ‘whoa’. Even Noah Webster’s dictionary included ‘hello’ in 1883.Who invented Hello?By the time the telephone came along, the Americans were saying ‘hullo’ to each other every day, so it was a short jump to ‘hello’. But it wasn’t until the telephone was invented that ‘hello’ emerged as a universal form of greeting and as a way of establishing contact.So, Edison made hello a popular greeting and an integral part of our lives. Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone in 1885, never liked ‘hello’ and advocated the use of ‘ahoy’ as a telephonic greeting.The telephone links kept expanding, so did the greeting. And soon it became a general greeting. Webster’s dictionary kept printing ‘hello’ as a greeting word even as Alexander Graham Bell rejected the greeting all his life! He insisted on saying ‘Ahoy, Ahoy’!But the dictionaries continued to promote hello as a standard greeting in the English language and won the word war. Hello, Alexander Graham Bell, are you listening?",

    "title": "Who is the real McCoy?",
    "article": "Ever heard the expression, is that the “real McCoy?” No, its not the musical group we are talking about. Real McCoy is actually a reference to one of America’s most prolific inventors, Elijah McCoy. McCoy invented and patented all kinds of mechanical things to help them work smoothly, efficiently and safely.Over time, the expression “real McCoy” has been used for anything that means the real thing, the real solution.Elijah McCoyElijah McCoy was born in 1843 at Colchester, in Ontario, Canada to George and Mildred McCoy. His parents had once been slaves at a large manor in Kentucky, America. However, they managed to escape to Canada before the American Civil War began in 1865. Following the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery and the McCoy family returned to settle at Ypsilanti, Michigan.As a child, Elijah was fascinated with all things mechanical. Encouraged by this interest Elijah’s parents saved money and sent him to Edinburgh in Scotland to study mechanical engineering.He soon returned with an engineering degree but as a “black man” and “negro”, as blacks have been addressed in scorn, Elijah couldn’t find work. Though slavery had been abolished and people of African origin were now considered American citizens, white Americans treated the Afro-Americans as inferior people. Their hearts and minds were still very racist.Afro-Americans were not allowed to vote nor given prominent jobs even when they were educated. Elijah with his engineering background could only get a job shovelling wood in locomotives for the Michigan Central Railroad.Part of his job was to oil the engine parts when the train stopped to take on water. Elijah decided to work on this problem of oiling the parts as the Michigan Railroad and other railways were finding it expensive and time-consuming. In 1872, he came up with a self-lubricating device for the steam engine and applied for a patent.A stamp printed in USA to honor railroad engineers of America. AlexanderZam / Shutterstock.comInitially his invention was smirked at and pooh-poohed because he was a black man. However, it was quite evident that his invention worked and the railroads took notice. Industrialists soon began to insist that the “real McCoy” or the self-lubricating device be installed in their engines.Elijah, the real McCoy, became famous. His name became synonymous with things that worked as against advertising gimmickry.In 1920, Elijah established his own factory, the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company, at Detroit, Michigan to manufacture products. He never looked back and never stopped inventing.Soon he had applied for over 50 patents in the U.S., Canada, Britain, and in various countries in Europe. All his inventions had to do with his love for mechanics. Till the end he continued to fiddle around with engines and even in his 70s he patented an improved air brake lubricator.Today, the real McCoy means the actual thing, unconsciously crediting the man who ‘real’ised things in everyday life!",

    "title": "Who or What is a Gladiator?",
    "article": "It all started in ancient Rome. The most brutal sport that has ever existed in the history of the world was the fights between gladiators. The ‘sport’ traces its roots to the custom among the Etruscan people, a civilisation in Italy that existed before the Roman civilisation. At the death of the master of the house, servants would duel to the death for the right to follow their owners in death and provide help and company.Image of a gladiator carved on concrete wallThe first ‘gladiatorial games’ were ‘offered’ in Rome in 264 B.C by sons of Junius Brutus Pera in their father’s honour after he had died. A gladiator was either a professional fighter or a slave, trained to entertain the public by engaging in combat with another person.Gladiatorial combat soon became a very popular form of public sport. People began to offer these ‘games’ and the number of matches. While the earliest gladiatorial combat consisted of three matches, a century later, Titus Flamininus offered 74 matches lasting over three days!At first the fights were confined only to funeral ceremonies, but gradually they became the chief amusement of the Romans and were held in huge arenas.Early gladiators were prisoners of war or slaves or condemned criminals but soon free citizens became gladiators hoping to win fame and fortune. With the popularity of these games, the State assumed greater control, and gladiators were trained in imperial schools. Under a manager, a troupe of gladiators could be sold or hired out, and wealthy citizens hired many as bodyguards.The Colosseum in Rome, Italy was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. KKulikov / Shutterstock.comIn Rome, the fights were first staged in the markets and then in the Forum, where temporary stands were erected. Amphitheatres (open air theatres) were constructed so people could watch these games. The largest of the amphitheatres was the Amphitheatrum Flavium, or Colosseum, which was inaugurated by Titus in 80 A.D. that could seat as many as 50,000 spectators.Called the games or circus, the spectacle was usually staged for Caesar and Rome. On the day of the games, the gladiators were ceremoniously led in and paraded around the arena before presenting themselves at the emperor’s podium. The gladiators wore splendid armour of gold and silver.After the parade, there was a mock battle with wooden weapons to build up the appetite of the spectators. Then the fight was begun in earnest with a variety of weapons. Wounded gladiators could lay down their shield and raise the left hand to plea for mercy where it was left to Caesar to decide his fate. As patron of the games, it was Caesar who made the final decision, although it often was necessary to appease the whims of the public.Caesar decided based on what the public wanted – a thumbs up sign and the gladiator’s life would be saved. If they held their thumb down the victim was killed.Victors were awarded crowns or a palm branch and whatever prize money that had been set before the start of the games, as well as any money awarded by the crowd.With the passage of time, the Romans got bored with even those ‘mild’ battles and invented new spectacle like women gladiators. However, Emperor Septimius Severus outlawed the practice.Increasingly, the fights became more and more bloody. Gladiators were set to battle with lions, tigers and other wild beasts. There were many efforts to stop these cruel sports. Thankfully in 326 A.D., Constantine abolished the games and the remaining schools closed by Honorius in 399 A.D. But gladiatorial combats continued, in one form or another, until 404 A.D., when Honorius finally prohibited them altogether.",

    "article": "On every Diwali, known as the festival of lights, our family has a big discussion on the kind of lighting we should have. And after talking about candles or electric bulbs we invariably choose the _diya_s or earthen lamps for their beautiful flames. But last year, we reached the kumhara or potter’s roadside shop a bit too late. The lamps had been sold out and the potter had a big smile on his face. So we decided to light candles.On Diwali eve we lit up the house with candles, putting one small candle between two large ones, to create a pattern. Horror of horrors, when we looked at them some time later, they had become much smaller. My five-year-old cousin thought it was magic. “Where did the wax disappear?” he asked. I smiled and remembered my uncle Prosanto, who had solved this mystery for me when I was a child.Who stole the Candle Wax?When wax disguises itself“When you wear a disguise, people cannot recognise you. Similarly when candle burns, the wax simply changes into something else.” That’s how my uncle had explained it.That process of burning is called combustion. Combustion is a chemical change which takes place in the presence of oxygen. During combustion one form of matter is changed into another. The burning of wood or coal is also combustion.The candle storyIf you take a close look at the candle you will find that it has a thread running though its centre – this is called the wick. The moment we light the wick the wax starts melting because of the heat. The molten wax rises up through the wick to meet the flame. The molten wax further heats on reaching close to the flame and evaporates to form a gas. The gaseous wax then starts burning, producing heat and light.What is wax made of?The wax of the candle is actually formed of carbon and hydrogen and so is called a hydrocarbon. Most fuels including petrol and coal are hydrocarbons. During the process of burning the carbon combines with the oxygen of the air and forms carbon dioxide. Hydrogen in turn combines with oxygen to form water vapour. In these two reactions wax is consumed and the size of the candle keeps reducing.So now you know what to tell someone who wants to know where the wax disappeared on burning.",

    "article": "Quick all you quizzards and prospective Who Wants to be a Millionaire candidates: Who was the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Presidents of the United States? James Polk, Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore . .? Yeah, but what about David Atchison? Wasn’t he sworn in after Polk? So shouldn’t Atchison be the 12th president and not Zachary Taylor?Yes. It’s true. There was a gap of a day between Polk stepping down and Taylor taking over. And Atchison stepped in as President – just for one day! The term for it is President pro tem.David Rice Atchison was born on August 11, 1807 in Kirklevington (earlier known as Frogtown), Kentucky. In 1843, Atchison was appointed to the United States Senate and he held this office till 1855.In 1849, the then 11th President, James Knox Polk, finished his term of office and was scheduled to step down from office at noon on Sunday, March 4, 1849.But the president-elect Zachary Taylor a devout Christian, refused to take office or be sworn in on a Sunday, the day of the Sabbath (According to the Bible, Sunday – the seventh day of the week – is when God rested after creating the world, and so Christians do not undertake any work).The United States Capitol building in Washington DC, USAThis posed a problem. The post of the president cannot be empty even for a day as decisions concerning the country and the world cannot be left unattended.Usually, the post is filled in by the vice-president who acts as the acting president. However, vice-president George M. Dallas’ term had also expired along with Polk’s and in fact, Dallas had earlier resigned on March 2.Under the American constitution, it is up to the President pro tem of the Senate to take on the mantle of presidency as the post of vice-president and president lies vacant. The Senate president was David Atchison at that time even though the Senate had been dissolved.President’s Day — President for a day!As per US constitutional law, the Senate leader continues to retain his seat even as the House is dissolved or suspended till such time a new session begins.David Atchison, thus, became interim President for a 24-hour period, even though he was never elected to the office. On March 4, 1849 David Rice Atchison was sworn in as acting President. A new vice-president was also sworn in – Millard Fillmore. In fact Fillmore went on to become President sixteen months later following the death of Zachary Taylor.This question of whether David Atchison was actually president or not has been hotly debated. However, he did step into the presidency. March 4, 1849 was an uneventful day in American history. Being a Sunday, Atchison was able to have a relaxed day at the White House.",

    "article": "The next time someone calls you an ape or a bird brain, ask her to think again. Brain scans of animals have revealed similar patterns of electrical activity in human and animal brains, so obviously humans aren’t the only smart ones around.Who’s the Brainiest of Them All?The brainiest animals are chimpanzees, which share 99 per cent of the human deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA as it is known. (DNA is a chain of molecules within the nucleus of a cell that have all the genetic information influencing the characteristics we inherit from our parents.)It has long been known that monkeys and chimps are very smart. For instance, if food is placed outside a monkeys cage on a piece of cloth, the monkey immediately understands that it must pull at the cloth to get the food.Chimps are even more intelligent. Scientists have observed them sharpening rocks in order to crack open coconuts and shells. No wonder chimps have even been taught sign language to express themselves.The brainiest animals are chimpanzees, which share 99 per cent of the human deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA.Chimps may be the brainiest of the lot, but talking birds are not far behind. And even among the kind that just warble, the birds with really intricate courtship songs have bigger brains than their note-poor rivals. It took experts (with state-of-the-art computers) almost three hours to distinguish a male bird singing 40 notes, from another bird singing 38 notes. Female birds on the other hand, can choose the better singer in minutes!Parrots are a cut above the rest of their feathered pals. These birds can be taught how to name and identify objects, besides being taught how to count.Many other species, including dolphins, whales, elephants and crows show intelligence, but not much is known about these animals. Unlike apes and talking birds, scientists haven’t studied other species quite as closely.Again, it is a known fact that dogs are perceptive animals and aware of what is happening around them. But scientists now believe that your pet dog might actually be able to sense what you are going to do. For instance, have you ever noticed how your dog starts pawing the door the moment you wear your shoes?Dogs have also been known to go into a state of frenzy just before their owner has an epileptic seizure. How and why a dog senses this subtle shift in its masters health is still a matter of debate. However, German scientists claim that apart from noticing what we are doing, dogs also sense small changes in our body chemistry.But until further research is carried out, we cannot be perfectly sure just how a dogs mind works.",

So the villagers, along with an NGO, decided to build small check dams called johads to trap rainwater. The men and women of all the villages gave voluntary labour and even contributed their own money to build the johads. The water table slowly began to rise. Forests began growing again.One day, after ten years of hard work, the efforts of the villagers was rewarded. Suddenly, after the monsoons, a river that was dry throughout the year started to flow. There was now enough water for people, animals and the fields, everyone was happy, until one day…A fat man came from Jaipur, and showed the villagers a permit from the government babus, that allowed him to catch all the fish in the newborn river.The villagers were very angry. How could they allow a stranger to come and benefit from all their hard work?By law, all surface water (river, ponds, lakes etc.) belong to the government. The villagers think otherwise. The case still goes on.[ Courtesy: Gobar Times, a children’s newspaper produced by the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.

    "title": "Why Do Horses Need Shoes?",
    "article": "Clip-clop, clip-clop goes a horse on the road. If you look carefully you will see that it walks on the tips of its toes – like a ballet dancer. Walking on tiptoe for a long time is difficult for us, but horses find it the easiest thing to do.The foot of a horse is divided into a toe with a broad tip. While other animals have nails and claws, the horse has a hoof surrounding the toe. The hoof area cannot feel any sensation; it is made of dead tissue (A similar example is our fingernails: we do not feel any pain while cutting them, because they are made of dead tissue.) The heels of the horse do not touch the ground.The centre of the horse’s foot is soft. It is called the frog. When the horse is carrying a rider or a heavy load, the hoof comes down heavily on the ground. The frog may not be able to bear the weight and could swell up. The horse could even become lame. It is to prevent this from happening that an iron horseshoe is fixed to the horse’s foot. It protects the frog and ensures that the horse can run as fast as the wind, or dance like a ballerina without worrying about its foot. Of course, horses that run free have no need to put on their iron shoes.",

    "article": "Have you ever laced your fingers together and bent your fingers back? If you pressed hard on any bent finger, you would have heard a popping sound? Finger joints produce that loud c-r-a-c-king sound. The sound comes when bubbles in the fluid around the joint burst!Our entire body is made of a skeleton of 206 bones. Bones help in giving shape and support to the body and help us move about. Our bones are not too long otherwise we would not be able to bend or grasp things. Bones fit together at joints which is the meeting place between different bones of the skeleton.Joints are divided into fixed and movable ones. Most of the joints in our face are fixed, with the exception of the bones of lower jaw which are flexible and move up and down like a hinge. Joints in our elbows, knees and ankles are flexible and we use them all the time to move around.Bones at these joints are held firm by tissues and ligaments. These are tough cords or straps. Inside each joint is a thin membranous bag that secretes a thick fluid called the synovial fluid. Just like oil lubricates an engine to move slickly, the fluid helps in lubrication and helps the joint move smoothly.When you stretch or bend your finger the bones of the joint are forced apart. As they move apart, the tissues that surround the joint are stretched. This increases the volume of space between the tissues. With an increase in volume the pressure in the synovial fluid drops forming bubbles. When the joint is stretched far enough the pressure drops so low that these bubbles burst, producing a popping sound.It takes half an hour for the gas to dissolve back into the synovial fluid. Once the gas is dissolved it is possible to pop the knuckles again. Lots of people are in the habit of popping knuckles but there is no harm or injury associated with knuckle popping.Scientists however, have seen signs of tissue damage and a decrease in grip strength in certain cases like professional sportspersons. This damage is a result of repeated stretching of the ligaments surrounding the joint.Knuckle popping however, does have its positive effects. An increase in mobility is seen in the joints immediately afterwards. When joints are stretched certain nerve endings are stimulated and the muscles surrounding the joint relax.If you are a first-timer be careful. Don’t press too hard or instead of cracking a bubble you may cause your bone to crack. After a hard day’s night. . . CRACK! POP! Pop! Aah, that feels good! Now tomorrow is another crack away.",

    "article": "Do you like fruits? Have you ever wondered why plants produce fruits? Is it only because nature wants you to enjoy eating its fruits and sing its praises?The answer is no. Plants are much smarter than what you think they are. They actually use human beings, animals and birds who eat their fruits to propagate their kind. In other words, disperse their seeds.The fruit serves as a mother’s womb where the embryo of a baby plant is nurtured. It protects the embryo, or the seed, in almost the same way as the mother protects her small ones. The flesh of the fruit serves as a protective lining as the seed develops. And, before the seed is ready to be sowed, the fruit is unripe and tastes sour. The sourness of the fruit discourages us from eating it.Why Do Plants Bear Fruit? [ 1874, Still Life with Fruit by Hermenegildo Bustos Hermenegildo Bustos / Public domain]Imagine what would have happened if raw fruits were sweet. It would have had an underdeveloped seed. After eating the fruit, you would throw the seed away. But, the seed, like a premature baby, would not have been able to bring about the birth of a new plant.So, nature decided that fruits should become sweet only when they are ripe and the seeds ready to be sown on earth. The ripe fruit tempts you to eat it. So that after you eat it and throw the seed on the ground, it germinates in the soil to bring about a new plant.Isn’t that smart?",

As clusters of stars take familiar forms – of a bear, a man in armor wielding a sword, millions of other stars simply twinkle. As if they were playing hide and seek with one’s eyes.We all know that each star is actually like the sun. And the huge collection of stars on the night sky is like a collection of many, many suns. But, the sun does not twinkle, one would point out. So why do other stars twinkle?The sun does not twinkle. It blazes down on us. If any of the stars were close to us, they would have also blazed down on us, or even burnt us down.Why Do Stars Twinkle?The stars look different because they are far away. And the light from the stars travels a very long distance to reach us. Actually very little of the light finally manages to reach us. Besides, it passes through the earth’s atmosphere before reaching us. As the light enters the atmosphere, impurities like dust interfere its path. So, sometimes it is visible, and sometimes it is not. This effect is called twinkling.There are certain stars in the night sky that don’t twinkle. Well that’s because they are not stars at all. They are planets. Planets do not twinkle because unlike stars they do not have their own light. They are like the moon. They reflect light from the Sun.So what is a star? A star is born when a cloud of lots of different gases, mainly hydrogen, get together. The gas particles attract each other and slowly get compressed to form a huge mass of gases. And, as this mass grows, the temperature inside grows too. Until such time when it bursts like a bomb. This explosion creates a gas called helium, which is inflammable in nature. The helium becomes its fuel and it continues burning. Thus is a star born.No wonder the heavier stars burn more furiously. They have bigger explosions, where more helium is released, providing more fuel. At the same time, these bigger and brighter stars have a shorter life. Why? Because they use up their fuel more quickly. The life of a smaller and lighter star can be as much as 100 times longer.",

    "article": "You’ve been playing in the pool for almost an hour now, practicing your best underwater somersaults. Now it’s time to get out, and as you look at your hands, it’s . . . it’s . . . it’s the attack of the wrinkly fingered monster!Don’t get frightened or run for cover under your towel yet. After spending lots of time in the water, it’s totally normal for fingers (and sometimes toes) to wrinkle.Why Do We Have Wrinkly Fingers After Swimming?Even though you can’t see it, your skin is covered with its own special oil called sebum. Sebum is found on the outermost layer of skin. Sebum lubricates and protects your skin. It also makes your skin a bit waterproof. That’s why getting caught in the rain, hopping in the shower after a game, or washing your hands before dinner won’t leave your skin soggy. Sebum is there to keep the water out.But what happens when you spend a long time in the water? Well, there’s only a particular amount of sebum on your skin at a time. Once the sebum is washed away, the water can make its way into the outer layer of skin. The water does this by osmosis. This is when water actually moves from one thing into another, from a place where there is more water to a place where there is less water. There is more water in the pool than there is in your body, so it naturally moves to the place where there is less water – you!Although your fingers may look shriveled like raisins, they aren’t really shriveled – they’re actually waterlogged! The extra water in your fingers causes the skin to swell in some places but not others, and that’s what causes the wrinkles.It isn’t just pool water that washes away the sebum. Sitting in the bathtub for a long soak can also wash away the sebum and leave a kid with soggy skin. Washing dishes for a long time, scrubbing and rinsing your puppy, cleaning the gravel in your aquarium – anything that keeps your hands in water long enough will give you wrinkly fingers.What should you do if you come out of the pool looking like a raisin? Not a thing! Having wrinkly skin after a swim or bath doesn’t mean there is anything wrong, and it goes away by itself quickly. You’ll have more sebum on your skin in no time. If you really can’t stand the raisin look and will be doing something around the house that keeps your hands in water, you can wear rubber gloves to keep the sebum from being washed away.",

    "article": "Sumit was a tireless bundle of energy. He was always up to some mischief or the other. As he grew, to his mother’s relief he became a more relaxed child, and over the years his energy level seems to have come down considerably. However, now he feels tired and fatigued. At times he wonders why he gets so tired so soon when there is so much that he wants to do?What is it in our body that causes fatigue? Why do we feel listless and sapped of strength at times? Fatigue is caused by a kind of poisoning produced by our organs. When a muscle in our body works, it produces lactic acid. If we remove the lactic acid from a tired muscle, it is able to start working at once.Why do we get tired?There are other substances the body produces in the course of muscular activity. These are known as fatigue toxins. Blood carries these toxins through the body, so that not only the muscle itself but the entire body and especially the brain, also feels tired.Scientists have conducted interesting experiments on fatigue. If a dog is made to work until it is exhausted and falls asleep, and its blood is then transfused into another dog, the second dog will instantly become tired and also feel sleepy. Similarly if the blood of a wide-awake dog is transfused into a tired, sleeping dog, the latter will wake up at once and no longer feel tired.But fatigue is not just a chemical process; it is also a biological process. We cannot just ‘remove’ fatigue; we must also allow the cells of the body to rest. Damages must be repaired, nerve cells of the brain must be ‘recharged’, and the muscles need to relax and unwind.Very often, the best way to make a tired body part feel fresh again is to make other parts of the body active. We can actually rest by means of activity. Activity increases the respiration. The blood circulates faster, the glands are more active, and the waste products are eliminated from the tired parts of the body.But, if you are totally exhausted the best thing to do is sleep. Sleep is a great vitaliser and relaxes the muscles and stops the production of the lactic acid. Sleep is thus very important and can thus, restore our body’s energy after a period of hard work. The best way to energise and refresh our tired muscles and body is to make it a point to sleep for at least eight hours every day.",

    "title": "Why Does Time Start in Greenwich?",
    "article": "Its six in the morning and the sun is streaming through the window of your home in Delhi. In New York, people are just packing up to go home as it is six in the evening!Nothing amazing about it. We know that the earth is round and that it revolves once in 24 hours. So while it is daytime in the east, it is still night in the west.But for ages, people measured time based on the position of the sun – it was noon when the sun was highest in the sky.Even in the Middle Ages, when mechanical clocks began to appear, cities would set their town clock by measuring the position of the sun. But every city would be on a slightly different time.So while some snored their way through the night a relative from a hundred miles away who had come visiting was kept awake and fuming outside the door! People wouldn’t accept the fact that time varied from village to village and they wasted more time fighting over this.Actually the confusion began with the invention of the clocks itself!Clocks were first invented in China around 100 A.D. from the earlier sundials which were simple devices that marked the movement of the sun with the movement of the earth. By 1300 A.D., large clocks with weights were invented and these consisted of gears that moved the hands. The problem was someone had to constantly reset the weights.In 1510, Peter Henlein of Germany discovered the spring-powered clock and in 1656, Christian Huygen, a Dutch scientist, patented the pendulum clock.Soon, several clocks sprung up in most towns and villages. This abundance of clocks caused confusion as each clock was set for noon for that particular village. But this problem was not taken into account until the postal service began.For ages, people measured time based on the position of the sun – it was noon when the sun was highest in the sky.Early posts were delivered by runners and they were supposed to wait for each other at a certain time at an appointed place. But while it was noon at village A, it was still 11 a.m. at village B a hundred miles westward and so the runner would not be present at the appointed time.By the next century when the railways were developed, it was altogether a different story. With the railways connecting distant towns and cities, it became imperative for passengers to know when the train would arrive and also what time they would reach their destination.Sometimes travelers missed their connecting train as various towns stuck to local time calculated according to the sun at noon. For instance, if the distance between New York and Chicago was to be covered in 18 hours and the train left New York at 10 a.m., it reached Chicago 18 hours later. No doubt it reached at 6 a.m. New York time, but the Chicago local time was something like 10 p.m.Britain was the first country to accept that a standard time was necessary and decided to adopt a single consistent time across the country to regulate train timings. The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828), which was taken up and implemented by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903). The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway in November 1840.However, the United States was a different story. It is so vast and as we know today, each state is in a different time zone. So while it was day in the east in New York, it was probably noon in Illinois and night in California.In November 1883, the U.S. and Canadian railways decided to adopt a standard time but there was much confusion as to what place should be taken as the prime median from which the standards could be set.In 1884 a Canadian railway engineer Sir Sanford Fleming suggested that the entire world be divided into time zones that would be calculated from a prime meridian. This would help calculate various time zones relative to that one.In October 1884, an International Meridian Conference met in Washington DC to settle the matter. Twenty-four countries participated and they chose Greenwich, a village just outside London in England as the prime meridian. However, two countries did not approve of the location.Why Greenwich? The delegates decided to adopt a meridian line at 0 degrees that passes through Greenwich. A principal transit instrument at the Observatory at Greenwich was to be established and this would be taken as the ‘initial meridian’.The prime meridian marked on the floor at the Royal Observatory in GreenwichSince the world was round and a circle consists of 360 degrees, the longitudes (horizontal lines dividing the world) would be calculated both east and west from this meridian. A universal day would thus be the mean solar day beginning at midnight at Greenwich and counted on a 24 hour clock.Though a majority agreed to establishing a Greenwich Mean Time or GMT as the world standard, enforcing this wasn’t easy. France refused to accept GMT till 1911.Countries that did approve the resolution also did not bother to incorporate GMT. For example Liberia did not incorporate GMT until 1972. Detroit for example, adopted GMT until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should be put back 28 minutes to Central Standard Time. Funnily enough, while one half the city adapted this Central Standard Time the one half of the city stayed with local time.Today, though there are discrepancies in timing, there are 24 different time zones established, demarking time across the world.",

    "title": "Why Don't Spiders Get Caught in Their Webs?",
    "article": "Spiders are not insects but are classified by biologists as arachnids. Arachnids are different from insects as they have eight legs and no antennae. There are over 40,000 species of spiders and some of them build webs while others rely on speed to catch their prey.A spider building its web is extremely fascinating to watch. Some spin these webs by squirting silken threads from modified excretory glands in their body. Each silk gland (some species have up to five) produces a different type of silk. Some silk glands produce a liquid silk that becomes dry outside the body; while other glands produce a sticky silk that stays sticky.Inside the spider’s abdomen are small organs called spinnerets that secrete the silk. A spider can stretch out each spinneret, pull it back in, and even squeeze them all together. Using different spinnerets, a spider can combine silk from different silk glands and produce a very thin thread or a thick, wide band.Not all parts of the web are sticky. A spider can control how much stickiness it needs to cover the web. Often the first strand is coated with a heavy layer of gum. This is carried in the breeze and sticks to a distant wall or branch.Why don’t spiders get caught in their webs?Next the spider weaves the outer spokes of the web and spirals inwards with dry silk. Finally it follows the outer layer eating some strands and replacing them with stiky silk.Some species (such as the water spider) use it to build underwater nests, while others make draglines to ride, using the wind to travel great distances. (Wherever a spider goes, it spins a silk thread behind itself. This thread is called a dragline).The dragline is also called a ‘lifeline’ because the spider often uses it to escape from enemies. If danger threatens a spider in its web, it can drop from the web on its dragline and hide in the grass. Then it climbs back up the dragline into its web. Strangely enough, baby spiders are not taught to spin webs, apparently the act comes naturally!Web spinning spiders have hard bristles on the underside of their legs. These bristles slot themselves over the silk thread and act as runners or skates. The spider can thus run freely over the web without getting stuck.To resist its own web trap, a spider’s body also produces an oily non-sticky coating. However, if by chance a spider manages to get entangled it eats its way out.",

    "title": "Why are Eggs Oval?",
    "article": "Have you ever climbed a tree and peeked into the nest of a crow or a sparrow? Or looked into that flowerpot where the noisy pigeon decided to lay its eggs? The sight of a mother hen sitting on a bunch of fresh white eggs is great, though most of us see them only when they land on the breakfast table every now and then.Eggs come in different colours. They may be blue, blue-green, yellow, spotted, blotched or white. No egg looks identical. Even those eggs that are laid in a clutch or at one time may have different colours. Most eggs are oval, and sometimes they are long and elongated. One end is slightly larger and heavier while the other end is smaller and conical.The shape of the egg has an important use. It protects the chick inside, until it is time for it to break out of its shell. For, even if you press from the outside, the shell will not break unless the chick inside presses too. The chick does it by tapping from inside with its soft beak when it is ready to face the world.How does the chick come out? Baby birds in fact have an ‘egg tooth’. This is a tiny knob at the tip of the beak to help them break out of the shell. It takes a chick 30 minutes to an hour to break the shell. Some albatross chicks have been known to take five to six days to break out as the shell is so thick!Most nests are shaped like a large bowl – the right shape for oval eggs to rest without rolling out and falling down. Birds that don’t build elaborate nests, like the penguin, the tern and other sea birds, have elongated eggs.Since these birds lay eggs on rocky ledges or on cliffs, the elongated shapes prevent the eggs from rolling over and breaking on the rocks. Instead they just spin around.Eggs must be kept warm in order to hatch – about 35 degree centigrade (That is about as warm as an early summer day in northern India). The adult bird provides constant warmth by sitting on the eggs or incubating them. Not only that, the bird keeps turning the eggs around so that all parts of the egg receive the same amount of warmth.Among most kinds of birds it is the female that incubates the eggs, but in some species it is the adult male which does the hatching. The only bird that doesn’t hatch its own chicks is the cuckoo.The bird is so cunning that it lays its eggs in other smaller bird’s nest. Since the eggs look similar the mother bird doesn’t realise that it is not hers and sits and hatches the cuckoo’s eggs too!The ostrich lays the largest and heaviest eggs. Each egg weighs around 1.7 kg (3.7 lb) and will not break even if a man weighing 120 kg stands on it. That is how hard the egg is. In fact the eggs are so large that the people living in the Kalahari desert in West Africa use them as a water-bottle!",

    "title": "Why are Human Voices Different?",
    "article": "Imagine a scenario. A criminal is being tried in court. He denies saying something. The prosecution brings a recording, saying they have his confession on tape. As the accused vigorously denies the voice being his, an expert shows just why the voice could be no one else’s.A fictional scene? Perhaps, but it is a reality that no two persons in the world have exactly the same voices. Do you know why this is so?The act of speaking involves movements of hundreds of muscles in split-second coordination. The speech organ called larynx or voice box is capable of producing an infinite number of sounds. It is that part of the throat through which air passes. When we breathe, air passes through the larynx downwards, through the mouth and nose, into the trachea (windpipe) and finally to the lungs.The larynx is made up of a tough wall of cartilage. Its inside lining has two folds of tissue stretching on each side and leaving a gap between them. These are called vocal cords. When a person is quiet and breathing, the gap between the cords remains wide open. The cords are slack.But talking, singing or shouting involves the tightening of the cords; the exhaled air causes the cords to vibrate and produce sound. Our vocal cords can be in any of about 170 different positions.If the vocal cords are slack, they may vibrate about 80 times per second and the result is deep tones. If they are tense, they vibrate rapidly, perhaps a 1000 times a second, and produce short sound waves or high tones.As a child has short vocal cords, they produce short air waves and consequently a high pitched voice. As a child grows, the vocal cords become longer. That causes the voice to become deeper. Thus,k the voices of adults are heavier and deeper than children’s voices.Similarly, the voice of most adult men is deeper than those of women. This is because a man’s larynx is larger than that of a woman. It also has longer cords.The pitch of voice depends upon the length of the vocal cords. Each voice has a certain range of frequencies. It is this range that determines the kind of voice a person has. Voices can be divided into six groups: bass, baritone, and tenor for men, and alto, mezzo soprano and soprano for women.The quality of human voice also depends on many other things such as resonating space, lungs, nasal cavities etc. The nose, sinuses, pharynx and oral cavity act as resonating chambers and modify the vocal tone produced by the vocal cords.The movement of the tongue against the palate, the shaping of the lips and arrangement of teeth also bring about changes in the voice. Since the structures and movements of all these organs are different in different persons, the voices of no two persons in the world can be identical.",

It is driven to the light by its mating instinct.Why are Moths attracted to light?Ultraviolet vision helps moths get together in the dark. And it is the heat coming from their bodies that makes them aware of each other. Thus, the heat waves from the flame seem like the powerful signals sent by a supermoth. And the moths fall for it every time. They obviously do not learn from their mistakes.It is the moths’ sense of smell that helps them come together. During the mating season, the female gives out an attractive smell. The male, who has a strong sense of smell, gets attracted to this. He zooms towards the female.A beautiful Luna Moth (Actias luna) on purple clematis flowers.Some males have elaborate antennae resembling feathery plumes. These carry sense organs that can pick up a scent as far as 10 km away.That may seem a huge amount of distance for a moth to respond. But these are the giant moths. There are certain kinds of moths, like the Atlas moths and the Hercules moths, which have a wingspan of about 30 cm. They are found in parts of east and southeast Asia.",

    "title": "Why are Some Plants Non-vegetarian?",
    "article": "Are you scared of going to the forest because you think there are man-eating tigers in the forest? What would you do if there were man-eating plants too?Don’t worry. Man-eating plants do not exist. But insect and animal-eating plants do. They are what you would call non-vegetarian plants.In fact, there are 500 varieties of plant species that trap prey and eat it. The most famous among these carnivorous plants are sundews, pitcher plants, bladderworts and the Venus flytrap.These plants are found in places with an acidic soil that lacks nutrients essential for the plant to make food.Actually it is not as if these plants cannot survive without being non-vegetarian. Like other plants, they also use light, carbon dioxide and water to make their food. But, without non-vegetarian components in their diet, they will lose strength and become easy victims of predators. They might even lose the fight for survival as their competitors take over.Most of these plants have worked out complex ways to catch their prey. The pitcher plant’s leaves are shaped like pitchers and a part of the leaf forms the lid. The mouth of the pitcher secretes a sweet-smelling substance, which tempts insects to the trapdoor. Once they step on to the threshold, they are tempted to move further to hunt for the source of the nectar. That proves to be the fatal step for them as they lose their grip on the slippery slope and fall into the pitcher. Some pitchers are big enough to kill small mammals, scorpions and reptiles. Nepenthes rajah, a species in Borneo, has pitchers, which are up to 35 cm long and 18 cm wide — large enough to trap a small rat.Although the sundews also use a sticky substance like the pitcher plant to attract their victims, they use a more active device to catch them. They have tentacles that close in on the prey the moment it lands on the leaf.The Venus flytrap’s leaves have fine hairs-like structures that are sensitive to touch. When an insect touches the trigger hairs, the leaf folds along its midrib, closing with such speed that the victim cannot escape.The bladderwort, which lives in water, uses something similar to a mousetrap to get its food. Its trap, which looks like a bladder, is sealed to maintain a partial vacuum and has a trapdoor entrance. The trapdoor has fine trigger hairs that are sensitive to movement. The bladderworts also use a sticky solution of mucus and sugar as bait. When an animal gets attracted by the sugary solution, it brushes against the trigger hairs, and the trapdoor flies open and the bladder sucks in water because of the partial vacuum in it. The victim is swept inside helplessly along with the water and the trapdoor closes on it. All of this happens in ten to fifteen thousandths of a second, so fast that human eyes may not be able to take in the action.After the victim has been trapped, the plant uses either bacteria or enzymes to absorb its nutrients.You will be surprised to know that it is not only plants that are carnivorous. Some fungi also have similar eating habits. The genus Dactylella is one of them. It strangles eelworms. It has threads known as hyphae, which form loops and when a worm puts its head or tail into the loop, the noose tightens. The fungus then sends out other hyphae to eat the corpse.",

    "title": "Why are Some Reptiles Brightly Coloured?",
    "article": "Most animals have skin colour that makes them merge into their surroundings. They become near invisible unless you look very closely. But some reptiles such as the sea-snakes, coral snakes and frogs of Central and South America are brilliantly coloured or have bright bands like deep yellow, orange, pink on their bodies.They are easily visible among the green leaves or brown earth. This is because these animals are poisonous. The colouring is a warning to other animals, especially their natural enemies, to avoid eating them. The frogs of Central America called the dart-poison frogs secrete a poison from their skin.The bright colours of the reptiles act as a warning to would-be predators to avoid eating them. The poison from the skin tastes so awful that the bird or snake quickly spits out the frog before the poison can take effect. Birds and other snakes learn to avoid these bright frogs and their poison.It is interesting that similar bright colour patterns have been developed over the centuries by many non-poisonous animals too as a survival mechanism to fool predators. Since predators avoid attacking these brilliant coloured animals, thinking of them as poisonous, these animals, too, escape getting killed.Even in the inset world, harmless insects, butterflies and moths mimic their poisonous fellow beings. The imitator is protected not only by the colouring and shape but also by the predator’s experience with the poisonous kind – once bitten, twice shy!",

    "title": "Why are Zebras Striped?",
    "article": "As a child I was always full of questions. I remember asking my parents why zebras were striped or why did giraffes have such a long neck. Most of the time the answers were elusive and I used to be very irritated. I could never get the right answer to satisfy my curiosity. I now realize why my parents could not give me a concrete answer. You see I happened to be in the same dilemma when my three-year-old daughter asked me the same question! I was faced with the difficult task of giving her half-baked answers or finding the right answers this time.The most obvious question to ask about zebras is why are zebras striped? Unfortunately nobody really knows the answer. Looking at zebras in the zoo, the striped pattern seems very conspicuous and could hardly be thought of as protective.Zoologists believe the stripes on a zebra could be one of several reasons. It could be basically for camouflage very much like the military fatigues. The bold wavy lines of a zebra blend in with the tall wavy grassy plains of Africa where these animals live. The bold stripe may even serve to break up the shape of the Zebra. If a zebra is standing still in such surroundings, a lion, its chief predator, may overlook it completely.Why are Zebras Striped?It doesn’t matter that the zebra’s stripes are black and white and the grass are dusty brown or green, because the lion is colour blind!However this may benefit an individual zebra in some situations but is it likely a large zebra herd would be able to escape a lion’s notice? This is exactly where it helps the zebra most. Zebra herds are very large but they stay very close to one another.When all the zebras stick together in a herd, the pattern of stripes blends in with the stripes of the zebras around it. This is confusing to the lion! All it can see is a large, moving, striped mass instead of many individual zebras. The lion has trouble picking out individual zebras and it’s harder still for the lion to recognize which way each zebra is moving!Each zebra pattern is unique like a fingerprint. Also like a fingerprint, the patter varies from zebra to zebra and no two zebras are exactly alike. What is truly amazing is that zebras can recognize other zebras from their body stripe! A mother can instantly spot her colt in a herd!There are three species classified according to the variations in the arrangement of the stripes – the Imperial or Grevy’s zebra, the Plains or Common zebra and the Mountain zebra – and several subspecies. The mountain zebra is the smallest of these averaging only four feet. It has silver-white stripes with black markings that extend to every part of the body except the stomach and the inner part of thighs. Plains zebras travel in large herds and are pale yellow with broad black stripes. This specie has several variations: some have stripes down to the hooves while the lower legs of the others are solid white without any stripes.Do you know that people of Africa think of zebras as black animals with white stripes whereas people outside Africa consider them as white animals with black stripes! Black stripes or white, the fact remains that zebras are extremely unique and are among the fastest and most graceful of runners in the African bush land.",

    "title": "Why can’t the Sun melt Snow?",
    "article": "There are some things in nature that have a great capacity to toss back or reflect a great deal of the sun’s light that falls on them. One of them is snow. Newly formed snow reflects about 90 per cent of the sunlight that falls upon it. This means that the sun is powerless to melt clean snow. And when snow does melt, it is not because of the sunlight. Snow does not melt on a spring day because of the sun’s heat. It melts because of the warm air from the sea.After snow becomes ice, a different problem arises. Clean ice absorbs about two-thirds of the sunlight that hits it – but ice is transparent enough for the light to penetrate quite a long way (10 metres or more) before the absorption takes place.Why can’t the Sun melt Snow?It is remarkable what profound results follow from this simple property of transparency to sunlight. If, instead of penetrating deeply, the light were absorbed in a shallow surface layer of ice, the summer sun would quickly raise the temperature of the thin surface layer to melting point. And almost immediately, the water would run off.But when the sunlight penetrates a thick layer of ice before it can be absorbed, it cannot raise the temperature of the ice to melting point quickly enough. When the ice is very cold, the whole summer passes before any melting occurs at all. This is what happens today in the Antarctic, just as it must have happened in northern Europe during an Ice Age.Just imagine, if by magic, ice were suddenly made opaque to light, the glaciers that exist today would melt away in a few years, raising the sea level by 60 metres or more. It would flood at least half the world’s population.Simply amazing how so much depends on so simple a physical property!Clouds toss back about 50 per cent of the light that hits them. Ice and deserts reflect 35 per cent. Land areas are generally a good deal lower in reflectivity – usually 10 to 20 per cent, depending on the nature of vegetation.Oceans, which cover 71 per cent of the Earth’s surface, are least reflective of all – only about three per cent. That is why oceans appear dark in pictures of the Earth taken from the Moon or from artificial satellites.When all the sources of reflection are added together, our planet is found to turn back into space some 36 per cent of the solar radiation falling upon it.From the Woodpecker volume 2000, brought out by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehra Dun, in north India. Creating environmentally sustainable technologies at the local level is its main concern.",

    "article": "Often, after an air disaster, we hear about the black box in the news. The black box does not play any part in making an aircraft fly but it serves an important function. It is basically an electronic device used by investigators to discover the cause of a crash and may be, prevent others.The black box can be inserted or removed from an aircraft. In a passenger aircraft there are actually two black boxes. One contains the flight data-recorder and the other, the cockpit-voice recorder.The flight data-recorder registers the aircraft’s speed, direction, altitude and other important information throughout the flight. The cockpit-voice recorder has a small cassette tape in it. This tape runs continuously like that in an answering machine. It has an endless loop of tape, which keeps recording each and every message. However, depending upon the capacity of the tape, one can retrieve messages in the previous 30 or 60 minutes.Illustration of a flight recorder (black box) in customary bright orangeBoth the recorders are placed in the cockpit of the plane.In order to protect the recorders, they are kept separately. These recorders are enclosed inside a crash-proof and fireproof metal shell. The interesting part is that although the flight recorder is called a ‘black box’ it is always painted bright yellow or orange!What! A black box is actually yellow you ask? The answer is simple – it is easier to find a brightly coloured item in wreckage when everything around you is black, charred from the fire.Although the flight recorder is called a ‘black box’ it is always painted bright yellow or orange!Then why call it a black box?The term ‘black box’ is not just confined to an aircraft.

    "title": "Why do Airplanes have Wings?",
    "article": "I remember my trip to Goa. The flight was scheduled for six a.m. As the aeroplane taxied on the runway it gained speed. I felt a kick in the stomach and then we were airborne. It was my first flight and I was very excited. My father who was sitting next to me, asked, “Can you tell me how the aircraft flies?”“Because of wings,” I replied promptly. But I could not tell him what the wings do to make a plane fly.A simple phenomenon – a grand explanationFather took a sheet of paper and held it by two parallel ends. The paper drooped from the other side due to its weight. Next, Father blew hard across the top of the paper. Amazingly, the drooping side of the paper suddenly straightened up and seemed to be floating in air. “This is exactly what happens with an aeroplane too,” he said.Why do Airplanes have Wings?“But no one’s blowing air on the aeroplane!” I said. The explanation followed – the aeroplane’s engines push it along the runway at a great speed. It is only when the wind starts rushing past its wings that the plane flies.Aerodynamics and wing designAn aeroplane’s wing is flat at the bottom and curved at the top. As the wing cuts through the air, the wind either flows along the top or the bottom of the wing.However, in going over the top of the wing the wind has to travel a longer distance because of the curve. Hence, it also has to travel faster. This creates a low air pressure on the top of the wings.As the plane gathers speed, this air pressure keeps decreasing. Meanwhile, the higher pressure underneath the wing helps to push it up. That’s how the aircraft gets the required push to rise in the air, just the way it made the paper straighten.Actually, all flying creatures and flying objects follow the same principle for sailing through the air. The next time I saw an aeroplane in flight, I gave my father a nodding smile, for I knew what flying was all about.",

    "title": "Why do Ants walk in a Line?",
    "article": "When I woke up one summer morning, I noticed a string of dashes on my bedroom wall. The line ran from the ceiling to the wall behind my bed and then disappeared under it.As I watched, I saw one of the dashes move. It was a small red ant walking up the line. Soon, another one followed and then another, till it grew into an army of ants marching up the wall.I noticed that while walking in a line the ants were cleaning the wall paint underneath them and, in the process, making a path. And there is a very good reason for them walking in a line.Why do ants walk in a line?Ants are social insects. They live in big colonies and have a very organised social life. Red ants make their nests inside the walls of our houses. They generally travel large distances in search for food. In absence of any maps or navigation aids, they have to rely on other mechanisms to find their way around.Scenting their wayAs they walk the ants leave behind a scent that they use to trace their way back to their nests just as in the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel, the children left a trail of pebbles to find their way home from the jungle. The scent that the ants leave behind is called pheromone. The ants walk in a line because they follow the scent left behind by the leader.If you want to test out this fact, use an eraser and rub it across the path that the ants are taking. The ants will stop precisely at the point where you have rubbed off the smell with the eraser. Directionless, they move in all directions.So the next time you see a single ant crawling chaotically on the floor, you know what it is looking for.",

    "article": "Picture a giant rat with a flat tail and webbed feet. That’s what the beaver looks like.There are two kinds of beavers: the American and the European. The European beaver, found in Norway, Poland, Germany and France, lives in burrows.But the American beaver builds a dam across a stream or lake to construct his home or lodge. The lodges are made of huge logs of trees.The American beaver constructs solid dams and lodges because it has the mind of an expert engineer among all the creatures in the animal kingdom. And it is hard-working too. Moreover, building fortress like lodges and dams helps it escape unfriendly animals.It is a fascinating process. The beaver first chooses a site towards the narrow end of a stream. Then it starts to fell trees. The animal stands on its hind legs and gnaws at the tree trunk with its sharp chisel-like teeth. The branches are cut off and the tree is then dragged or floated to the chosen site to dam the water. The tree acts like a wall.The beaver uses broken branches, stones and mud to make the dam watertight. On this structure it builds a large dome-shaped lodge with two underwater entrances. One is a general entrance while the other entrance helps the beaver escape the animals that could harm it.The beaver uses the lodge to store food as well as to raise its young. Since lakes and rivers freeze in winter, the lodge becomes a refuge from preying animals. Due to its underwater entrances the beaver can come and go as it pleases under the ice. Beaver dams also act as channels to control the flow of water in a stream or lake.And that’s how the term eager beaver came about.",

    "title": "Why do Cats Always Land on Their Feet?",
    "article": "When someone falls from the fourth or fifth floor, and survives, we call it a miracle. When a cat falls from that height, we watch astonished as it lands on all fours, pauses, then straighten up and walks away looking just a little fazed. What would you call this, a miracle or God’s grace?Any guesses why cats survive while humans don’t? Well, it all has to do with the in-built ability of a cat to adjust its position during a sudden fall, its light weight and lithe muscular body. While humans tumble uncontrollably and completely lose control over their bodies when they fall, cats are able to straighten themselves even in mid-air and manage to fall on their feet.Why do Cats Always Land on Their Feet?A cat called Sabrina fell from the top of a 32-storeyed building and walked away with only a chipped tooth and a collapsed lung! For long, humans have not been able to comprehend a cat’s ability to fall gracefully, till a cat falling from a great height was photographed by a high-speed camera.This is what the camera filmed: when a cat falls from a great height, on its way down, it extends all four legs sideways as if it is gliding. This exposes a greater surface area to the air below, almost like a tiny parachute.And because cats are so light, at one point, the speed with which they fall is almost equal to the upward thrust of air and the two get balanced. As a result, the cat continues to fall but at a steady speed, unlike humans who hurtle down with an increasing speed to crash on the ground. This gives the cat a bearing over the situation and it spreads its limbs out like a parachute.Unlike humans, cats do not tumble because of an exceptional sensory system. It immediately tells the cat’s nervous system that it is upside down and falling. Thanks to this, the agile cat twists its body at once for a safer landing. Even its feet are flexed in order to absorb the shock of the fall.And the cat’s muscles that join and surround its bones make the best shock absorbers ever made!In fact, the cat’s agility, alertness and swift reaction to emergencies has given it the reputation of surviving no matter what happens.",

Oh? Is it already “Time for school?” later still its “time for dinner” or “time for bed!” Old Father Time can be quite an interfering busybody and there really is nothing we can do. Most of us spend a greater part of our time and lives trying to beat exactly this – time!Strangely enough the clock’s needles seem to take forever to inch forward during a dull lesson, while time really flies when we are having a good time!All of us are time conscious. We surround ourselves with alarm clocks, cuckoo clocks, wristwatches, grandfather clocks and peering at them to make sure we are sticking to our schedule. But have you ever taken a moment to wonder why the needles on the face of a clock move the way they do? Why do the hour and minute needles move from left to right (in what is now called the ‘clockwise direction’) and not vice-versa? No, it is not the whim of the inventor actually there is a scientific explanation for this observation.Why do Clocks Run Clockwise?Throughout history, time has been measured by the movement of the Sun (or, more accurately, the motion of the Earth relative to the Sun). The earliest form of timekeeping dates as far back as 3500 B.C. This was the shadow clock or the sundials – a vertical stick or obelisk (A tall, four-sided shaft of stone, usually tapered and monolithic, that rises to a point) that casts a shadow. An example of this clock can be seen at Jantar Mantar in Delhi.People had already realised that the earth is round and that it revolves around the sun. So for ages people measured time based on the position of the sun – it was noon when the sun was highest in the sky.The earliest clocks were invented in China around 100 A.D. based on these earlier sundials, which were simple devices that marked the movement of the sun with the movement of the earth.Prague Astronomical Clock: A medieval astronomical clock, on the southern wall of Old Town City Hall in the Old Town Square, Prague, Czech Republic.Mechanical clocks were invented in the Northern Hemisphere in the 14th century and the inventors naturally wanted the device to follow the sun’s movement in the sky. In the Northern Hemisphere the Sun appears to move in the sky from the left to the right and so the hands of the clock were made to follow the Sun’s motion, moving from left to right or what is commonly known as clockwise. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere and face the South, you can watch the Sun rising on your left (the East) pass overhead and set in the West (at your right).As simple as that! Come to think of it, if the mechanical clock had been invented in the Southern Hemisphere, the hand on the dial of your watch would have been moving from right to left!Do you know there are some Jewish and Arabic clocks that run anti-clockwise? This makes perfect sense as Arabic and Hebrew readers (Arabic and Hebrew characters are written right to left) but baffles everyone else!The clock at the bottom with the Hebrew numbers runs counterclockwise. The one on top with the Roman numerals runs ‘clockwise’. This spire is located in the Old Jewish Town Hall in Josefov, Prague, Czech Republic.",

    "article": "If you place the first three fingers of your hand on the inside of your wrist, a dull throbbing reverberates through your hand. Da-dub, da-dub, da-dub. Very reassuring, these gentle thuds, that remind us that our bodies are kicking along, and that, at least at last touch, we’re alive and well.By pulse we mean the regular throbbing of arteries caused by the successive contractions of the heart. During the action of the heart there is a pause. During this pause, the wall of the aorta contracts. The aorta is the great trunk artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.This contraction forces the excess blood to proceed along the arteries. This alternate expansion and contraction of the aorta produces a throbbing in the arteries. And this throbbing – which can be felt at many points in the body – through the skin, is called pulse.Why do doctors examine the pulse?The pulse can be felt by placing fingers on the inside of the wrist over the radical artery. It can also be felt at the temples where we have the temporal artery or at other places where an artery is near the surface of the skin.The pulse cannot be felt in the veins because the blood reaches them from the arteries by passing through narrow capillaries.Now the question arises. Why does a nurse or doctor examine the pulse of a patient?When a doctor checks the pulse, beats are counted for a minute. Since the rate of contractions felt at the wrist would be same as the heart rate, the pulse tells us about the health of the heart.The pulse rate depends on the blood requirement of the body. This rate indicates how fast the heart is beating and the state of pressure in the circulatory system. An irregular pulse rate indicates some abnormality in the functioning of the heart.The number of pulsations per minute normally varies from 78 to 82 among women and from 70 to 72 among men. Abnormalities in the pulse rate often indicate specific disorders of the heart and circulatory system.The pulse rate in children is much higher than in healthy adults. The normal rate for a seven-year-old child is 90 beats per minute. A newborn baby’s pulse rate is double that of an adult male, about 140. At the other end, elderly people can have a pulse rate as slow as 50-65.",

    "article": "Recently I went to the top of a skyscraper in a lift. After I had gone up a few stories, I felt a funny sensation in my ears. My eardrums seemed like they were growing and were about to burst. As I went a little higher, the sensation was worse. My fellow passengers in the lift told me to swallow a few times. This would help the sensation pass, they said. And, it did.This happens to a lot of people when they are flying, or skiing downhill at very high speeds, or going deep into a mine well.This feeling is what is known as the popping of the ears.But why do ears pop?In the atmosphere, the pressure of air decreases as we go higher. So when I was traveling up in the lift, the air pressure on my ears changed rapidly. But, the pressure of air inside my ear drum remained what the pressure was at the ground level. As I went up, the air inside my ear drum became higher than the air pressure outside. So my ears tried to reduce the pressure inside. In this effort, the air inside pressed against my ear drum, making me feel like my ear drums were going to burst.Similarly, if try to go down into a mine well, the pressure of air outside the ear will be higher than that of the air inside. Then the opposite will happen. The air outside will try to cave in my ear drums. And it will hurt me.The pressure inside the ear is maintained by a device called the Eustachian tube. This tube links the middle ear to the throat. There is a valve at the end of it which admits or releases air to equalise the pressures inside and out. But I’ll have to swallow in order to open it. The popping of my ears is the internal sign reminding me to swallow when I’m travelling up or down at a high speed.Popping is called barotrauma. It is one of those rare disorders which wears off with a few swallows or yawns.But not, if I have a heavy cold. Then my ears are in danger of suffering some damage because of the close links between the throat and the ears.",

    "title": "Why do Earthquakes Occur?",
    "article": "As a result of upheavals below its surface, the earth shakes now and then. This shaking of the earth is known as an earthquake.Few natural events are as violently destructive as an earthquake. It usually strikes without warning, giving off violent vibrations in the process. These vibrations not only shake the ground but also sometimes crack it open. And then, there is chaos, for earthquakes have been known to wipe out cities and civilisations.About a million earthquakes occur in one year, but most of them are small tremors. And almost 90 percent of them occur underwater along the “ring of fire” that circles the Pacific Ocean. Other areas that are prone to earthquakes are the Alpine belt stretching between Spain and Turkey, through the Himalayas to Southeast Asia.Why do earthquakes occur? The earth is made up of many layers. The outermost layer or lithosphere, below the surface, is called the shell or crust. It consists of seven huge slabs or plates, which are as thick as approximately 100 km (60 miles) that move at the speed of 10 centimetres a year. Picture these tectonic plates carrying continents and ocean floors on their shoulders, for that is what they do.Most earthquakes take place along the boundary between two plates. The slow but constant movement subjects the plate borders to tremendous stress, which builds in the bedrock for decades and centuries.When the strain produced by these movements increase beyond a certain level, the pent-up energy cracks up the rocks and creates a fracture known as a fault. This sudden release of energy also unleashes ground-shaking vibrations. These vibrations or seismic waves are what make up an earthquake.If you drop a stone in a pond, ripples are created. The seismic waves travel outward in all directions from the quake’s focus, in a similar manner. Waves that reach the surface spread out in concentric circles from the epicentre. The epicentre is the spot on the ground that lies directly above the focus.Recording instruments called seismographs have helped geologists identify types of seismic waves, and the most damaging waves among them.In the 1930s, the Richter scale was developed to compare earthquake intensities worldwide. The scale measures the amplitude or the entire range of ground motion, and not the amount of damage caused. The most powerful earthquakes to be recorded by the scale, which starts at zero, are in the range of eight or nine on the Richter scale.A major quake is often followed by many smaller tremors known as aftershocks. They release any energy still left in the rocks and occur in parts of the fault where the original quake took place.One of the most destructive earthquakes in India occurred around the Brahmaputra Basin and neighbouring regions in Assam, in northeast India, in 1950. Besides major landslides and rifts, it destroyed hundreds of villages and killed many people.In recent times, one of the worst earthquakes in India took place in 1991 in the Chamoli-Uttarkashi region of northern India. As a result, over 2,000 people were killed, more than 1,800 were injured and 18,000 buildings were destroyed.Earthquakes can be severe enough to alter the topography of a region. An earthquake that occurred in Japan in 1923 caused major land upheavals throughout the Kanto region, which was the epicenter. The floor of Tokyo Bay rose three metres, while the nearby Izu Peninsula was shoved nearly four metres to the west. It was the worst in Japan’s history.Japan and neighbouring regions are among the most earthquake-prone regions in the world. The San Andreas fault in California is another. The fault makes the region very prone to earthquakes, the most recent one being in the Landers region, in 1992.While scientists have still not been able to predict an earthquake, they have identified certain indicators that foretell an earthquake. This they have done by studying areas of the world with a high risk of earthquakes. So small earthquakes and tectonic plate movements, and swelling or tilting of the ground are some omens.",

    "title": "Why do Flies have Compound Eyes?",
    "article": "Just like a man woos the woman he loves, takes her to nice restaurants, buys her presents, and courts her to impress her before marriage, animals too choose their mates through courtship.Since animals cannot do all these, they do it differently. Some animals put up a colourful display, while others give little gifts to their beloved – a choice worm, a designer nest and so on. A few species display their love through a series of grunts and others, like the Saurus crane or the stickleback fish, perform an intricate courtship dance.Bowerbirds of New Guinea and Australia, create a small tower with twigs, shells, and flowers to attract the female and the tailorbird builds an intricate cocooned nest. Looking at nature’s numerous examples, one thing is quite obvious – impressing the other sex is quite a challenge.Scientists have been studying the mating habits of animals and insects for years. Very few species can claim to have it easy. However, a recent study shows that the male houseflies have always had an eye out for the female of the species.The eye of the fly is quite complex. Flies eyes’ are compound in nature – they contain as many as 28,000 light-sensitive structures called ommatidia (pronounced: om-ha-tee-dee-ya) grouped under the cornea.The cornea in turn is composed of an equal number of hexagonal prism-shaped structures, each forming a separate image. The final image thus formed is actually like a mosaic image.A macro portrait of the compound eye of a fly: Why do flies have compound eyes?Compound eyes are only found in invertebrates (animals lacking a backbone). Entomologists (scientists who study insects) point out that compound eyes are adapted to spot swiftly moving objects, whereas simple eyes (the kind you and I have) are better adapted to see nearby objects and detect changes in light intensity.The study reveals that specific region in the male fly’s eye helps them keep track of fast moving objects – a mechanism which they use to track female flies.Unlike female flies, which generally glide along minding their own business, male flies are constantly on the look out for a partner. American scientists have named this specific region of the male fly’s eye, ‘the love spot’. They say that this region is enlarged to process incoming visual signals 60 per cent faster than females.Since the cells of the ‘the love spot’ work much faster than those of female flies, male flies have an edge in zeroing in on potential mates.However, whenever there is a good thing going there is a small catch, and for the male flies too the catch is that this specialised region in the eye consumes a lot of ‘metabolic’ energy.Scientists theorise that since the male flies are not involved in laying eggs, the excess energy saved is put to use into other activities. Whereas in the case of female flies, they need to save up their energy to lay eggs.The fly family can be divided into two major suborders – one consists of slender insects with long antennae, such as the mosquito and gnat, while the members of the other order, like the housefly, have stouter bodies and short antennae.Flies make up one of the largest insect order for they contain about 80,000 known species and are found throughout the world, including Antarctica.",

    "title": "Why do Humans Sweat?",
    "article": "It is an annual ritual in most Indian homes. With the onset of summer it is time to bring the rusty, rickety old coolers down from the terrace and get them repaired. The reason is obvious – it is difficult to live through the hot, sweaty Indian summer without an air cooler. But did you know that the human body has its own cooler as well?Think of the times you have travelled in a car. How hot the vehicle engine gets after a long journey. Similarly, as our bodies chug along they produce heat in the process.They normally maintain a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degree Celsius) and become feverish if it rises above this point.Unlike a car engine, however, our bodies have a system to check “overheating”. This is done with the help of sweat, which serves as a coolant.Why do Humans Sweat?How does sweat cool?Try this out. Put a small drop of water on the back of your hand. Then place your mouth close to your hand and blow hard. That spot will gradually feel cool. This is because the water begins to evaporate with your blowing and produces a cooling sensation.The inbuilt cooling system of the body uses the skin and blood for its functioning. The blood warms up as it passes through muscles and tissue. It carries the extra heat to the surface of the skin, which triggers the sweat glands in the skin to produce sweat – a combination of water (usually about 99 per cent) with small amounts of salts and amino acids dissolved in it.The sweat escapes through tiny pores on the skin, evaporating as it reaches the surface. As the sweat evaporates, it cools the skin beneath.In fact, a pearl-sized bead of sweat can cool nearly one litre of blood by 1.8 degree Centigrade (one degree Fahrenheit).Why do we sweat more in summer?Have you ever wondered why you sweat more on hot summer afternoons? Actually, the human body sweats all the time, even when we are sleeping.But when we exercise or perform some strenuous work we sweat more as the body gets heated up faster. As a result, we sweat more during summers and less during winters. The rate of sweating is directly related to our body temperature.Remember, the more you sweat the more you lose water. So, the next time you go out in the sun, make sure you drink enough water because, like the room cooler, the system under your skin needs water to function.",

    "title": "Why do Locusts Swarm?",
    "article": "Have you ever tried chasing a frisky grasshopper? If you have, you will definitely know that scampering after a jumpy bug is not an easy task. Most species of grasshoppers have a keen sense of hearing and the moment they sense trouble, they can hop fast and furious!Sometimes, shortage of food turns grasshoppers into migratory insects as they venture out in search of newer pastures. This situation happens when the species begins reproducing rapidly and does not have enough food for all the members of its community.When a normally non-migratory grasshopper becomes migratory, it changes its external form and becomes what is known as a locust.  For instance, a locust’s leg muscles are more powerful than our muscles and can propel the insect higher than ten times its own length. At the highest point of the jump, the insect begins to use its wings to move through air.In fact, true locusts are migratory short horned grasshoppers.  Normally, they are shy and prefer to be alone. But in a huge swarm, they become a menace and are capable of stripping a field in a matter of hours.Locust swarm eating everything in their pathWhy do locusts swarm?Until recently, little was known about why solitary grasshoppers change their behaviour when in company – grouping together to indulge in widespread mayhem. Now, zoologists at the University of Oxford, UK, say they have identified the biological mechanism that causes locusts to swarm.Headed by Stephen Simpson, the team has pointed out the sensitive hairs on the insects’ legs, which activate swarming. Incredible as it may sound, this discovery was made by tickling locusts under study, with a paintbrush! Tickling other parts of the locust, such as its antennae or back had no effect on behaviour.It is the tiny hair on the hind legs that get stimulated when the insects group together – turning the harmless insects into destructive pests. The scientists point out that the nervous system sends a message to the insects’ brain, which in turn triggers off a chemical reaction that results in swarming!The research team says that this discovery has great importance for it could finally lead to the production of insecticides capable of stopping vast swarms of locusts from wreaking havoc on crops.",

    "title": "Why do Meteorites Strike the Earth?",
    "article": "On a hot summer afternoon, I sat down with my elder brother to play carom. I took the first strike and pocketed two coins. Then I did a little war dance. Wow!Suddenly dada (Bengali for elder brother) had an idea. “How would it be if a fast-travelling object hit the earth? Quite like the way the striker hit the coins.”I was amused. “How is it possible? The earth is so huge. Anyway there aren’t any strikers flying around in the solar system?”First lessons about the solar systemThen dada explained. Apart from the sun and the nine planets in our solar system, there are a huge number of small rocks and smaller heavenly objects, which circle the sun. Sometimes, these rocks leave their paths and head straight for the earth, attracted by the earth’s gravitational pull.These heavenly bodies that fall to the earth are called meteorites. Usually, the earth is bombarded by several thousand of them each day. And sometimes they can be huge – as huge as a football field.One of the world’s best preserved meteorite impact site is in Northern Arizona, USA. Today, Meteor Crater is nearly one mile across, 2.4 miles in circumference and more than 550 feet deep. Scientists estimate that this crater was caused some 50,000 years ago when a piece of an nickel-iron meteorite traveling at 26,000 miles per hour hit planet EarthThe meteorite and the dinosaurImagine a rock the size of your school hitting the earth. In the 1980s, a crater with a 110-mile diameter was discovered in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Traced to a huge meteorite hit on the earth, it was dated back to 65 million years ago – roughly around the time the dinosaurs became extinct.This led to a theory in the scientist community that dinosaurs became extinct because of the large-scale environmental changes brought about by the enormous impact of the meteor hit. A 110-mile meteorite hitting the earth would be greater than exploding a thousand hydrogen bombs together, and would virtually wipe out every living species from earth’s face.While it is possible to roughly predict the timing of a meteorite hit for scientists who are constantly peering at outer space, they would find it difficult to point at the exact location of the hit. What they can do is to estimate how close they will come to earth.",

    "title": "Why do Onions Make us Cry?",
    "article": "One of the earliest memories I have as a child is when I was approximately three or four years old. I remember watching my mother work in the kitchen. She was cutting onions for the salad and I could see tears in her eyes. For a child the worst possible thing is to watch his/her mother cry. I got so upset that I got hysterical at my father for causing her pain. For I assumed my father was somehow responsible as we were only the three of us in our family.Later they explained it to me that it was the onion that was at fault and not my father as I thought. In fact many of us still do not know why onions make us cry – people take it as part of their lives and accept it stoically.Why do Onions Make us Cry?To begin with did you know that you ‘cry’ all day long? Every time you blink your eye there is a fine layer of water in your eyes. You see, there is a tear gland that is situated over the outer corner of each eye. Every time your eyelid closes, it creates a suction, which takes out some fluid from the tear gland. This fluid we call ‘tears’.Normally this fluid has only one purpose. This is to cleanse the cornea, the white portion of the eye, and so prevent it from drying out. But suppose some irritating substance reaches the eye? The eye automatically blinks and tears instantly appear to wash the irritant out of the eye and protect the eye against the irritant.We are all familiar with the experience of having smoke get into our eyes. It makes us cry. Well the onion sends out an irritating substance too. The onion has an oil containing sulphur, which gives it its sharp tangy odour. This same substance also irritates the eye. The eye reacts by blinking and by producing tears to wash away the irritant! It is as simple as that.The onion is an interesting vegetable. It is a member of the lily family, and it is a native of Asia. Onions belong to the genus Alliums and are therefore related to the milder Leek and the very pungent Garlic, both of which are cultivated extensively in Europe. The mildest and the biggest onion is the Spanish onion, which often weighs 450 grams or more.Man has used the onion as food for thousands of years. Big or small we cannot do without this interesting vegetable even as we start crying at the very thought of cutting it.",

    "title": "Why do People Kiss Under the Mistletoe?",
    "article": "In millions of homes in Europe and America, a sprig of mistletoe with berries is hung outside the doorway at Christmastime. According to custom, a man is allowed to kiss a girl if she is standing under the mistletoe.Why do People Kiss Under the Mistletoe?Legend has it that when Balder, the son of the Norse goddess Frigga was killed by an arrow made of mistletoe by Loki, an evil spirit, Frigga wept tears of white berries which brought him back to life. Overjoyed, Frigga blessed the plant and bestowed to kiss all who passed beneath it.From earliest times the mistletoe was regarded as a plant that increases life and fertility. However the Mistletoe themselves are are parasitic plants — they survive by attaching to the branches of a tree or shrub and absorbing water and nutrients from the host plant.The mistletoe is actually a parasitic plant. It can only grow if its seeds are left on branches or tree trunks. When the seeds sprout it sends a single root that ends up as a sucker (or sucking mechanism). It enters the host tree, mostly oak, and eventually may surround an entire branch.Birds eat mistletoe berries and the seeds stick to their beaks. When the birds rub their beaks the seeds fall on to other trees and the mistletoe sprouts again.The mistletoe was considered magical by the Celts, who lived hundreds of years ago in what is now Great Britain and France. The Celtic tribes (Britons, Gauls, Irish, Scots, etc) were nature worshippers. They worshipped over 300 gods and their priests were called druids.Many of their rituals were connected with the worship of trees and they believed that anything that that grew without its roots in the soil was mystical. They believed that the mistletoe was a gift from the gods for life and fertility and also guard against evil spirits. In the Celtic language mistletoe means ‘all-heal’.Why do People Kiss Under the Mistletoe?Since the druids considered the oak tree sacred, they would cut the mistletoe that grew on it with a golden sickle (remember Asterix comics and the druid Getafix?) and hang it over their doors. They believed that this would bring happiness to whoever enters the house and would protect the family from evil spirits.In ancient times it was customary for the visitor to kiss the hand of the host, signifying that the visitor has come in good faith. Since the mistletoe brings happiness, to kiss under it was a pledge of eternal friendship.Custom has it that a man who kisses a woman under the mistletoe would pluck a berry, until all the berries are plucked. When there are no berries left, the kissing should cease.Traditionally, if an unmarried girl is kissed under the mistletoe, the mistletoe is then burnt in the belief that the girl would get married.When the Romans conquered Britain and Gaul (now France), they brought with them new rituals and adopted some Celtic ones. With the spread of the new Christian religion throughout Europe and Britain came newer rituals but this did not make people forget their early customs.Hey, now, hold on! That doesn’t mean you lurk outside doorways waiting for just such an opportunity! Nor can you hold up a sprig of mistletoe over a girl’s head and kiss her. Instead of a buss on the cheek, you will probably get a sock on the mouth. So be(a)ware.",

    "title": "Why do Plants Lean Toward Sunlight?",
    "article": "Plants kept inside a room always grow in the direction of the window. In woodlands where there is a thick canopy of trees and sunlight rarely falls on earth, very few plants survive. Those that do, do not require sunlight to make their food.People have long wondered about this phenomenon until the answer was discovered and explained by the English naturalist Charles Darwin. He demonstrated that the growing shoot of a grass seedling always bends towards light. This is due to a phenomenon called phototropism.Why do Plants Lean Toward Sunlight? We know that green plants make their food by the process of photosynthesis. The leaves of the green plants contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll converts water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air into oxygen and sugar.Oxygen is then released into the air and sugar is taken as food by the plant. But this entire process of making food can only be done in the presence of sunlight. The leaves, therefore, lean towards the light for photosynthesis. Without sunlight green plants cannot survive.How does a rigid plant bend or grow to one side? Plant cells contain a substance called aurins. This substance has a tendency to move away from the light. Aurins make the cells on the darker side grow faster than the cells on the lighted side.Why does the Sun follow You?This causes the stems and the leaves to bend or lean towards the lighted side. The concentration of aurins on the dark side may be due to the fact that sunlight slows or kills these aurins when light falls on them. However, as long as one part of the plant gets sunlight, it can make food and the whole plant survives.Try this experiment at home or in school. Take a potted plant and put it near a window where there is sunlight. Take another potted plant and keep it in the darkest corner of the room. After a week or 10 days, you will notice that the plant near the window is healthy while that in the dark corner is not.",

    "title": "Why do Some People Stutter?",
    "article": "Rahul is a lonely child. He is laughed at because whenever he speaks, he stutters. He goes “my name is Ra-Ra-Rahul.” His mother and grandmother thought it was because he had a short tongue. Other people said it was because, as a baby, Rahul’s hair was cut before he spoke his first word. Finally, Rahul’s mother took him to the doctor. She was told that it had nothing to do with these myths. Rather, Rahul had a speech disorder called dysphemia.When we speak, a complex system of muscles coordinates the tongue, larynx (voice box), lips and mouth to produce sound. Sometimes a spasm occurs in these muscles and the speaker gets stuck with the first sound of the word. So instead of saying ‘Rahul’ the person would say ‘Ra-Ra-Rahul’.Very many myths surround this disorder. People think stuttering is caused by forcing a left-handed child to be right-handed or tickling the child too much and so on. Stuttering or stammering is a speech disorder, the cause of which is still unknown.It would be mere speculation to suggest it may have something to do with physical disorder or emotional disturbance. It can, though, be hereditary and is found to occur in children in the age group of six or seven years. It afflicts boys more than girls.Can stuttering be controlled?It is generally accepted that if you have a speech disorder, you should learn to accept the situation and overcome the fear. By accepting the worst you feel confident enough to relax and be spontaneous.Stuttering is difficult to treat and demands skill and a sense of responsibility on the part of the therapist. It can be corrected through psychotherapy or speech therapy. Those afflicted are taught to read and speak slowly, distinctly and to breathe regularly while speaking.Parental counselling can sometimes help prevent stuttering. Parents can ensure that their children do not develop habits of hesitation or syllable repetition while speaking.People who stutter must remember that it is not their fault. Also, they do not stutter all the time. When they are singing, whispering, speaking in chorus or when they are alone or being totally spontaneous, they are perfect.There are days when one does not stutter at all while other days can be sheer misery. When trying to impress someone, do not try to hide the fact that you stutter and make a mess of it. Instead, make people pay attention to what you are saying, not how you are saying it.In the end, remember, stuttering is a disorder that interferes with the flow of speech. But you are not alone. Nearly everyone suffers from this problem to some extent. However, the differentiating factor is the frequency and severity of behaviour and loss of control. It is this loss of control, which can’t be experienced by the listener and causes the greatest problem.",

    "article": "If you ever slept in a room with an uncle or an aunt who snores, you would know how annoying it can be. The person causing all the noise sleeps like a log, while the room partner spends the night tossing and turning; waking up bleary-eyed the next morning.Did you know that snoring is a common ailment all over the world? Believe it or not, but on an average one in every four adults snores, says the website sleepquest.com, a site listed by Britannica.Why do people snore? Why doesn’t a little baby snore? Well, snoring is caused by the flapping of soft tissue in the throat. When we sleep, the muscles in our bodies relax and the soft tissues become slack.Why do Some People snore More than Others? An image of a snoring husband.The wind pipe and snoringWhen we breathe, the air passes through the wind pipe on its way to the lungs. At the same time, the muscles around the wind pipe contract making the wind pipe narrow. Since, the wind pipe is narrow, the air passing through it is under a greater pressure.Normally, while we are awake, this is not a problem. However while we sleep, the soft flabby tissues in our throat is slack. The gush of high pressured air causes these flabby tissues to vibrate producing a rattling snore.It is really very difficult to cure snoring. There are several flabby tissues in the airway, mouth and throat and finding out which is the errant flapper is quite difficult.And the older a person gets, the looser the tissues in the throat and mouth become. This explains why elderly people snore more than young children.British researchers are trying to develop a ‘snore meter’ that aims to identify which tissue is vibrating and causing the problem. Most scientists are of the belief that a snore is a mixture of different sounds, created by different tissues flapping around.For instance, sometimes the flabby tissue of the throat and the mucous lining in the nose region vibrate together to produce an ear-splitting snore. Once the loudest flapper of the lot is identified, high-tech laser surgery would be used to harden the tissue so that it doesn’t flap anymore.",

The White House runner Deepak was giving our Blue House sprinter, Sanjay, tough competition.As the sprinters neared the finishing line, and the shouts turned into screams, I noticed something remarkable. Everyone had cupped their hands around their mouths while shouting.The gesture caught my attention. I had seen that kind of a hand movement in plays and folk dances. What is the reason behind this theatrical gesture?Why do We Cup Our Hands When We Shout?The science behind soundIt has something to do with sound waves and the way we hear. The vibrations of vocal chords in the throat produce sound waves, which come out through our mouth and travel through the air in all directions. The vocal chords are tiny strings, which hang from our voice box or larynx. The sound, which we produce, spreads out in all directions like ripples in a pond.When these waves strike a person’s ear, she or he is able to hear our sound. When the waves spread out in all directions, a person standing at a distance is not able to hear it with intensity, for the energy of the sound waves is also spread out.But, when we cup our hands around our mouth, the sound waves travel only in one direction. The intensity of the sound waves does not decrease. Thus, the sound can travel much further and clearly reach a person standing at a distance. Cupping your hands around your mouth is a simple method of making your voice reach farther.As for the sports meet, White House defeated Blue House and bagged the sports trophy.

    "title": "Why do Woollens Get Holes?",
    "article": "Most people think moths are responsible for eating up our woollen clothes, furs and rugs and making holes in them. This is because when we open these boxes in spring, a number of moths fly out. Don’t you believe it! Moths do not eat wool.It is the larvae (caterpillar) of certain moths that cause holes in our woollens. Caterpillars feed on wool, furs and other fabrics and damage them. But where do these caterpillars come from? The lifecycle of moths, butterflies and sawflies is in four stages – eggs, larva (caterpillar), pupa and adult.The female moth is a very smart insect. It lays thousands of eggs on rugs, furs and woolens or inside cupboards. Soon these eggs hatch into caterpillars. During this stage the caterpillar’s main function is to eat and grow. Caterpillars have strong biting jaws and chew up woollens easily.Caterpillars then make their cocoon in a variety of ways. The cocoon is a protective shell-like covering the caterpillar forms around itself before entering the next stage – the pupa stage. For example, the case-making moth makes a little tubular case out of the wool it eats and lines it with silk while the tapestry caterpillar makes a series of tunnels and lines them with silk. When it is ready to go into the pupa stage it goes into one of these tunnels until it is ready to come out as a moth.This is how our woollens and furs get those holes. To protect clothes against such damage one must ensure that it is free of eggs. Before packing woolens, furs or rugs for the summer, a good airing and brushing will help get rid of any eggs or moths. Clothes can be wrapped in heavy paper as moths cannot eat through paper.Caterpillars of certain moths feed on wool, furs and other fabrics and damage them.While mothballs do keep moths away, they do not kill eggs or larvae already present in clothes or cupboards. However, keeping these insects among your woolens could be fun if you are a lepidopterist (one who collects butterflies or moths as a hobby). Imagine the wonderful collection of insects you could grow right out of your clothes!",

    "title": "Why do some Rivers Flow Underground",
    "article": "From ancient times, people have settled down along the banks of rivers, since they provide water to drink, to irrigate their fields, and to use as waterways to go from one place to another.But hidden away, below the earth, are rivers that we rarely see, until they surface near the sea, or when they merge with another river. Some have names and are talked of with a sense of mystery, but many are nameless streams that flow through the nooks and crannies of the earth.In India, the River Saraswati is believed to flow underground and join the Ganga and the Yamuna at Allahabad. It was once an important tributary of the Indus, but now is lost in the sands of the Thar desert, in Rajasthan. Most devout Hindus would, however, claim that it continues to flow underground.What, after all, are these underground rivers?Underground rivers are really just flowing reservoirs of rainwater. This rainwater percolates down through the earth’s surface to collect at a level where solid rock prevents the water from going any deeper.As more and more rainwater percolates through, it increases the pressure on this trapped water. A slight crack, a small opening, is all that the water needs to push through and flow. Voila! You then have an underground river.The flow of water within rocks depends upon two properties: the rock’s porosity and permeability. Porosity is that part of a rock’s volume, which is made up of empty space or with vessels that allow liquids to flow through. Crystalline rocks have low porosity which is why water finds it difficult to go through. However, sedimentary rocks have high porosity, hence water cuts through easily.Permeability basically describes a substance that allows liquids and gases to flow through. Therefore, if underground water is surrounded by porous and permeable rocks, the water will push its way through easily.Underground water follows the steepest slope down. Limestone rocks are honeycombed with tunnels and cones. When rainwater – which contains a certain amount of acid – falls on them, an interesting process takes place. The water starts flowing through the tunnels and caves seeking a way out.As the water moves along, it wears away more and more of the surrounding rock to produce long tunnels, which eventually turn into underground rivers. These rivers finally reach the sea by surfacing at certain places.Underground rivers are also born when a powerful spring is unable to surface because of the solidity and compactness of the uppermost layer of rock. It simply redirects its energy and starts flowing underground, looking for an alternate way out.The distance travelled underground by such a river varies. In some cases it is more and in some others less. The famous Rhine of France travels only a short distance underground. The Saraswati travels completely underground, which is why many people doubt its existence.Some people have made it their life’s work to study such rivers. Speleologists – or scientists who study and explore caves – have tried to follow the course of some underground rivers but many passages are too narrow to get through. What they do then is to mix a dye in the water so that when it surfaces they can accurately identify where the underground river started, and where it finally surfaced.",

    "title": "Why do we Blink?",
    "article": "How many times do you blink in a minute? Weird, who knows! Well, mostly people blink around 15 times a minute (Reader’s Digest – Why in the World).Blinking is an involuntary action that protects the eye. Most of our eye is enclosed in a bony socket covered with a layer of fat, which forms a protective cover. But when the eyes are open, one-tenth of the total surface area is exposed to the atmosphere. This means the eye, the most delicate and sensitive part of the body, has to withstand the dust present in the air.So, what do the eyes do as a safeguard mechanism? They blink. Blinking helps in two ways. It lubricates the eyes and keeps the front portion clear for good vision. When we blink, a film of tears covers the eyes and washes all the minute dust particles that may be present.That is the physiological reason behind blinking but we blink for psychological reasons as well. For instance, nervousness, loud noises, stress and tension affect the number of times we blink. You can even try it out yourself. Count the number of times you blink when you do something wrong. The tension would probably make you blink more.But a driver using all his concentration powers, to manoeuvre his way through a crowded street, will probably blink less. The effort to concentrate on the task ahead will make him blink a fewer number of times.Observe people around to see who blinks how many times in what surroundings. It sure can be fun.",

    "title": "Why do we Get Hiccups?",
    "article": "Hic! You’ve just hiccuped for what seems like the tenth time since you finished your big dinner. Wonder where these funny noises are coming from? The part to blame is your diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle at the bottom of your chest, and all hiccups start here.The diaphragm almost always works perfectly. It pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs.But sometimes the diaphragm becomes irritated, and when this happens, it pushes up in a jerky way that makes your breath come out differently from how it normally does. When this irregular breath hits your voice box, you’re left with a big hiccup.Some things that irritate the diaphragm are eating too quickly or too much, an irritation in the stomach or the throat, or feeling nervous or excited. Almost all cases of the hiccups last only a few minutes. Some cases of the hiccups can last for days or weeks, but this is very unusual, and it’s usually a sign of another medical problem.You’ve probably heard lots of suggestions for how to get rid of hiccups, and maybe you’ve even tried a few. Breathing into a paper bag is one way some people can get rid of their hiccups, other people say that drinking from the wrong side of a glass of water is the way to become hiccup-free. Putting sugar under your tongue might work, too.And maybe the most famous treatment – having someone jump out and scare you when you’re not expecting it, helps some people wave good-bye to their hiccups.",

    "title": "Why do we Yawn?",
    "article": "Do you think that a great big yawn means you are really bored? Well, if you do, then you cannot possibly be further from the truth. Until recently many researchers used to think yawning is essential to increasing the oxygen intake to the lungs. A few on the other hand insisted that yawning is similar to stretching as it increases blood pressure and heart beat rate.While both research findings are correct, new studies show that yawning actually perks you up instead of doing the opposite (as many of us seem to think). Scientists point out that we have a tendency to yawn before a big event – athletes yawn before a race, pilots yawn before take-off and you yawn before an exam.Humans are not the only ones affected by the yawning bug. Animals have been observed to yawn before feeding time while wild animals have a tendency to yawn before a fight.Why do we Yawn?The act is also highly contagious so if you spot someone with his mouth open, chances are, you too will follow suit. New findings highlight something totally unthinkable – yawning might be a primitive handover from our ancestors signalling a need for change. Or in other words, the act essentially prepares the brain for change.Believe it or not but even a baby in the womb yawns as it shifts position, however children do not begin to copy other people’s yawns until the age of four or five. Studies show that this period of growth is crucial to the learning process as the child improves his/her social skills.Strangely enough contagious yawning is also linked to intelligence in children (who show the first signs of contagious yawning) surpassing other slow learners.Hundreds and thousands of years ago, the campfire served as the main gathering point for all the members of the group. Researchers claim that as the people sat around the fire, warming themselves, they would yawn if the leader yawned, as a mark of respect. Those who were more supportive of the leader were more inclined to yawn.Come to think of it, there might be some truth in it. Have you ever noticed yawning is more contagious if the yawner is someone you like or who you are close to?? It’s true and there is ample documentation of the fact.Despite all these advancements scientists still haven’t figured out why we yawn before bed-time, but then again, that is our way of demanding a change -enough of TV, its time to go to bed!",

    "article": "Switch on the television and you are bound to see some cola advertisements. Aamir Khan, a Bollywood hero, pops open a cola and the bubbly drink fizzes to the top. Have you ever wondered what causes the countless teeny bubbles in all these soft drinks?Soft drinks are carbonated, i.e. carbon dioxide gas is dissolved in the liquid. This gas gives the drink its sparkle and tangy taste, and prevents it from spoiling (the gas reduces bacterial growth).Carbon dioxide gas dissolves in a liquid solution only under high pressure. When a cola bottle is popped open, pressure is released and the carbon dioxide gas rises up. It forms countless tiny bubbles that pop and create a fizzing sound.Why does Cola Fizz?If you shake a bottle of cola before opening it, what happens?The shaking causes some of the gas to come out of the cola solution. As the lid is not yet opened, the gas gets compressed in the tiny space – above the cola and below the lid. This causes a pressure to build up. When the cap is opened, the drink sprays out on you and creates a mess.Two parts of oxygen and one of carbon: CO2Carbon dioxide is a colourless, odourless gas that does not burn. One molecule of the gas consists of one atom of carbon, joined to two atoms of oxygen (CO2). Dissolving carbon dioxide gas in a solution is known as carbonation.Carbonation takes place by chilling the liquid and letting it flow over a series of plates in an enclosure that contains carbon dioxide under pressure. The lower the temperature and the higher the pressure, the greater the amount of gas that dissolves in the drink. Besides causing the fizz in soft drinks, carbon dioxide is also used to put out fires. Solid carbon dioxide (known as dry ice), is widely used to refrigerate things, as its cooling effect is almost twice that of water ice.",

    "article": "If you cut an onion, you begin crying. Have you ever wondered why this happens — why onions make tears run down your face?Well, onions contain a oil, which has lots of sulphur in it. When you cut the onion, this oil is released. It evaporates very fast. When the oil gases reach your eyes, it causes irritation and sends signals to your tear gland to produce tears. So that the tears can wash away the irritant from your eyes.Actually the tear glands produce tears all the time. But, that is a very small amount — about a quarter teaspoon a day, to keep the eyes moist. The tears help wash away bacteria and other foreign particles that enter the eyes.Why does cutting onions make us cry?When you cut onions, the onion oil gases enter your eyes. It irritates your eyes and your tear glands produce extra tears to clean it. Then the excess amount runs down your face and the irritant is also removed along with it.See, how your body has its own way of cleaning itself!The tear gland is present near the nose on the lower eyelid. You can see it if you go close to a mirror. It has a tiny hole on it. This is where the tears come from.If you want to cut onions without crying, try this. Cut onions under water. The water will wash away most of the oil present in the onions. And, you can save those precious tears!",

    "article": "How many times have you seen milk boil and spill over, and wondered why this happens? To answer this question we have to know a little more about the composition of milk.Milk and its compositionUnlike water, milk is not a simple liquid. It is a colloid and contains many substances in suspended form. These substances are mainly protein, sugar and fat. When milk is heated slowly, the proteins and fat get separated. Since they are lighter than the milk they collect on the surface in the form of a layer called cream.Why does Milk spill over when it Boils?Of water vapour and spilling milkMilk also has a large quantity of water in it. During heating some water gets converted into water vapour. The water vapour being lighter, rises up.As the upper layer of the milk is covered with cream, the vapour gets trapped below it. As the milk is heated further, the water vapour expands and thick foam is produced on top.Finally, the trapped vapour lifts the layer of cream up, quite like a hot air balloon, and finally bursts through this layer. As the vapour escapes, a lot of cream and milk spill out.How we can prevent milk from spillingIt is very easy to prevent milk from spilling. All one has to do is to provide a path for the vapour to escape. For this we can keep a long-handled spoon in the milk container so that water vapour is able to escape along the handle of the spoon. This prevents the vapour from getting trapped under the layer of cream and thus spilling over of milk.",

    "title": "Why does a Cricket Ball Swing?",
    "article": "How many times have all of us heard that the former captain of the Indian cricket team, Kapil Dev, was one of the greatest out-swing bowlers of all times. Indeed! He took more than 430 wickets in Test cricket. But, do you know how a cricket ball swings?The term ‘swing’ refers to the movement of the cricket ball in the air after it leaves the bowler’s hand, which takes the ball away from or towards the batsman. If the ball moves away from the batsman it is called an out-swinger; if the ball moves towards the batsman it is called the in-swinger.On to the seamThe cricket ball swings because of its shape and shine. If you look at a cricket ball carefully, you will see a narrow strip at the centre, which is considerably raised. This is called the seam. Actually, a cricket ball is made of two pieces of leather, which are stitched together along the seam.Seam + shine + wind = swingHave you ever noticed that bowlers keep rubbing and polishing one side of the ball? This is done to maintain the shine of the ball on one side and keep the other side rough. This is the key to the swing of the ball.The side that has the shine provides little resistance to the wind, while the rough side resists the flow of the wind. The fast moving wind on the shiny side hits the raised seam and pushes the ball in the opposite direction, thus making the ball swing.Out-swingers and in-swingersIf the shining side is kept on the left hand side while bowling to a right handed batsmen, you will get an In-swinger as the wind will push the ball into the batsmen. Similarly to get an Out-swinger, a bowler keeps the shining side on the right side while delivering.A twist in the tale: the reverse swingFrom time to time we have heard it being said that a particular cricketer can make the ball reverse swing? Whatever does that mean?The reverse swing is a method through which a ball can be made to be swing in the opposite direction. That is, with the action of an out-swinger you can achieve an in-swinger. But how is this possible, you would ask?Yes, this is where controversy steps in. Reverse swing can be achieved by tampering with the ball, i.e. raising the seam forcefully, or damaging the bowl intentionally so as to make the shining side heavier than the rough side. Ball tampering or damaging is not permitted by international cricketing rules and bowlers can be suspended for doing it.So the next time someone asks you about how a cricket ball swings, you’re sure to know the answer.",

    "title": "Why does a Kentish Plover Parent Desert its Family?",
    "article": "When couples exchange vows on the marriage day, they generally say ‘till death do us part’. For a species of shore-dwelling bird called the Kentish Plover, it is ‘till divorce do us part’.Indeed, birds of this species usually leave their partners after the incubation (hatching) of the eggs and usually it is the female who moves on, while the male stays on to look after the babies. A recent study conducted by Andras Kosztolanyi of the University of Debrecen, in Hungary, sheds light on the reason behind this behaviour.During his experiments, Kosztolanyi removed both the parents from the nest and found that when one of the parents was removed during incubation, the eggs generally failed to hatch.Adult Kentish Plover Water BirdOnce the eggs are hatched, however, a single parent is as good at tending the young ones as both do together. This means if one parent deserts after the eggs have hatched, it would cause little problems. But, why would a bird desert its own nest?Kosztolanyi found out that they do this in order to raise another family. Whether a bird deserts or stays with the family depends on whether it can build another nest or not. This means that the birds may actually build two or more nests in a single season. And the act of deserting one nest and moving on to another is simply an intelligent decision to keep up the population.However, divorce, or rather separation, seems to be a very delicate decision. A bird decides to leave only after it has weighed all the pros and cons. First, it has to make sure that the other parent will not abandon the nest as well. Secondly, it has to be sure of finding another mate.The scientists have also found that, often, it is the female who abandons her mate and off-spring. This may be related to the fact that the number of males outnumber the females. It was also discovered that the rate of divorces decline towards the end of the Plover breeding season. This may be due to the fact that by the end of the season, there is hardly any time left to build another nest, so it makes sense to concentrate on raising the existing young ones.",

    "article": "Have you ever noticed that when you are in a car, or a bus, travelling on a straight road, the Sun appears to move right along with you?While telephone poles and trees close to the road, whiz past in the blink of an eye, the Sun is always visible throughout the journey. No matter how fast Daddy drives, you just cannot leave the Sun behind.Strangely enough, the trees nearer the road disappear from your range of vision more quickly than the trees further off. Why is this so?Our eyes have a certain ‘range’ of vision. You can see things only within that range. For instance, you cannot see objects behind your head. This field of vision widens out from the point where you are. Objects further away are visible for a longer period, even as your car whizzes by.Why does the Sun follow You?Field of visionTo understand what the range of vision is, draw a triangle as in the picture and name the corners A, B and C, such that the distance between A and B is equal to the distance between A and C. The point A indicates your position. Now draw a line DE in the triangle, parallel to BC, such that ADE forms a smaller triangle ‘within’ ABC.Look at the triangle. You will see that BC is longer than DE. This means that your field of vision at any point on the line BC is wider than what you can see on any point on the line DE. This means that your line of vision widens as the distance from your eyes (point A) increases.As a result, objects further away from you stay longer in your field of vision since the range is larger than nearby objects. And very distant objects appear to be in the same position for a long time.The Sun is 149,597,870 kilometres away from the Earth. That is a huge distance, so it seems to stay in the same place, in relation to your car, no matter how fast you travel.The only thing that travels fast enough to make the Sun appear to move in the sky is the Earth itself. If you consider a point on the equator, the Earth rotates on its axis at a speed slightly more than 1,600 kilometres per hour.The equator is an imaginary circle on the surface of the Earth which is at a equal distance from the poles and divides the Earth into two parts – the northern and southern hemispheres.However, the Earth is huge, and despite rotating at such an incredible speed, it takes 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds to complete one full rotation.On an average, the Earth takes 24 hours to make one complete rotation and as it moves on its axis, the Sun appears to move along the horizon – rising from the East, moving overhead and finally setting on the West. The length of one day is averaged over the period of a year.",

    "article": "Have you ever had a drink of cool refreshing water from a ‘matka’ or earthen clay pot placed outside? Surprisingly enough, the pots are exposed to blazing sunlight, yet the water within stays so cool. How is that possible?This is because of a physical process known as evaporation. When a liquid changes to a gaseous (or vapour) state without boiling, it is known as evaporation.A matka is made of mud and has many minute pores (extremely small holes). No matter how tightly you pack the mud, these pores remain. It is through these pores that the water, placed inside the matka, oozes out. Now, to evaporate, the water needs to absorb heat, which will change it to vapour.The only way the water oozing out of the matka can turn to vapour is by absorbing heat from the liquid within the matka and the matka itself. Due to this process of continuous absorption of heat from the water inside the matka, in a few hours, this water becomes cool.Why Does Water stay Cool in ‘Matkas’ (earthen clay pots)?Glass and metal do not have any pores. So the water placed inside glass and metal vessels cannot seep out and evaporate. Therefore, the water inside remains hot.Evaporation: nature’s air-conditionerIn nature, there are countless examples of evaporation. For instance, have you ever noticed how a dog hangs its tongue out after running around? The saliva on its tongue evaporates and the tongue becomes cooler. In turn, the dog also feels cooler.Why do we feel cool under a fan? This is because the sweat, that is oozing out of the pores in our skin, evaporates in the fan’s breeze. The heat needed for the sweat to evaporate is absorbed from the object it comes in contact with (our body) and so we feel cooler.You know, an adult marching through a desert may sweat up to 10 litres of water a day! A person may lose a lot of body salt through the sweat if he perspires too much. This can result in painful cramps, especially if he drinks water without adding salt to it.That is why you must remember to drink lots and lots of water before going out on a hot afternoon.",

    "article": "All the food we eat goes into our stomach. Here, it is broken into smaller and simpler substances and get absorbed into the blood. Then, the blood carries these food particles to the different cells of the body, where they are used to provide energy to our body.Why doesn’t our stomach get digested?How is food broken into smaller particles?When we eat, the glands lining the walls of the stomach secrete a thin, strongly acidic, almost colorless liquid, called gastric juice. It contains two kinds of enzymes called pepsin and rennin that break down the food to simpler substances. These enzymes can function only in a highly acidic environment.That is why the gastric juices contain a very strong acid called hydrochloric acid. It is a colourless, or, faintly yellow, corrosive, and fuming liquid. The acid is so strong that it can corrode metal and burn almost anything that touches it.Though all humans carry this strong acid in their stomachs, surprisingly it does not harm them. This is because of the presence of a slimy, white liquid that flows out our noses. It is called mucus.It is a viscous mixture of mucins, water, electrolytes, epithelial cells, that form the inner lining of the skin, and leukocytes, which are white blood cells that fight disease. It is secreted by glands present on the surface of our nose and stomach.Mucins are glycoproteins which make any substance viscous and act as a lubricant.The mucus secreted by different parts of our bodies have special functions. In our nose, it serves as a lubricator and stops dirt and dust from going deep into the nose and also aids breathing. In our stomach, it forms a layer between the deadly gastric juices and the lining of the stomach walls. This mucus lining prevents the acid present in the gastric juices from damaging the stomach.This wall created by the mucus layer is called the mucus membrane. It behaves like an acid-proof glove that the stomach uses to save itself from getting burnt while using harmful acids.",

    "title": "Why don't Birds on a wire get a shock?",
    "article": "Now how is that possible? The fact is, for a living creature to get a ‘shock’ there has to be a substantial flow of current through the body. However, there is barely any current running through the bird’s body for two reasons. Firstly, the bird not only forms a circuit with the wire, but it also offers a high resistance to current, so the current passes through the wire instead of the bird.It’s a bit like this, would you prefer going on a smooth road or a road full of potholes? The answer is obvious and just like you, the current prefers taking the easier path. All objects offer some amount of resistance to the flow of current, depending on the material.Why don’t Birds on a wire get a shock?This is just one of the reasons why birds don’t get shock, however the more important reason why current does not pass through the bird is, there is barely any, if at all, voltage difference across the bird. Current flow is actually just the flow of minute charged particles that are invisible to the naked eye. These charged particles need an energy input in order for them to get transferred. The amount of energy needed to move the charges from one point to another is measured in terms of the potential difference between the two points.A bird perched on high-tension wires has both its feet placed firmly on the same wire, so the net potential difference from one end of the bird to the other is, for all purposes, next to nil.In order for current to flow through the bird, there must be a sizeable difference in voltage across the body. While the potential difference between the wire and Earth may be thousands of volts, the potential difference between the bird’s two feet is extremely tiny and so a very small current flows through the bird which can barely be registered.If the bird were to touch the wire and simultaneously another wire, it would receive a mild shock. On the other hand if it were to touch the wire and some other object connected to the ground, it would receive a deadly shock, the greater the potential difference, the greater is the current flow.",

    "title": "Why is Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow?",
    "article": "Here’s a quiz question: what is curly or straight and needs to be combed, brushed, plaited or twisted? It is gelled, shampooed, dyed, coloured black, blonde, white, red, brown and needs to be cut once in a while. A hint – the answer is above your head – it’s your hair!Each time you pass by a mirror, the one thing that strikes you is the hair on your head. Hair is something that grows by itself without any help. Well, actually, brushing and combing and even oiling it does help or else you tend to lose your hair.Though the most noticeable presence of hair is on the head, it grows all over the body – out of the ears, on the chest, upper lip, cheeks, arms and legs. The only place hair doesn’t grow hair is on the lips itself and on the inner palms of the hands and feet.Human hair in different colors and texturesBasically there are two types of hair – the thick, coarse hair on the head and face and the light fine hair on the arms and legs.Hair is a kind of a skin tissue that is hardened by a protein called keratin. Keratin is what covers the outer skin and that is why hair grows on all these places too.The hair cells constantly multiply under the skin. Each cell keeps dividing and creating more cells. The new cells push the old cells above the skin surface and that’s how hair grows.Of course, once the hair cells are out on the surface, they lose the ability to multiply. They become dead cells. And that is why hair acts as a protector.It protects the head by keeping it warm. This was a very important function in the early days when humans used to live in caves and had to face intense cold. The fact that they were very hairy protected them from the winter cold.Another function of hair is to protect the delicate parts such as eyes. Eyelashes, for instance, prevent dust from entering the eyes. Hair in animals also acts as a camouflage.Hair anatomyBeneath the skin, hair begins to grow inside a small tube called a follicle.As it grows, it pushes upwards through the skin. Blood vessels in the follicle feed the hair root and help it grow.In every hair follicle is an oil gland called the sebaceous gland. These oil glands provide shine and gloss to the hair.There are over 100,000 hairs on your head. If hair is not cut it can normally grow over to five feet and sometimes 10 feet or more. The reason we do not have such long hair is because it grows at a rate of only about half an inch in a month. Also, we shed 50 to 100 hairs every day while washing and combing.Hair comes in a variety of colours: blonde, brown, red, black, etc. This is due to a pigment called melanin that gives hair and skin its colour.The colour of hair depends on the parent’s genes and the amount of melanin present. The lighter someone’s hair, the less melanin he or she has.Hair care is very important. Rubbing hard or yanking hair while combing a tangle can cause hair to break. Dirty and unkempt hair also attracts lice.Shampooing hair and gelling hair keeps hair conditioned and gives it a wavy bounce. However, luxurious and shiny hair doesn’t come from conditioners or shampoo but from healthy food and nutrients.Hair sometimes turns grey. Sometimes young people have grey hair mixed with their dark hair. Heredity and old age are important factors attributed to graying hair.As we grow old, the middle layer of hair ceases to produce colour pigments normally distributed through the hair cells. Lack of colour pigments turn hair colour grey.Not for nothing is hair called the crowning glory. It frames a face and makes it attractive. People spend enormous amounts of money on wigs. The study of hairstyles and hair ornamentation down the ages, is a fascinating area of study. And, very often, one can spot old styles returning after a while.People from different cultures have different ideas of what makes for a beautiful hair and style, especially when it concerns women. For example, in India and many other Asian countries, long, black hair is supposed to the mark of beauty whereas in the West, blonde and shoulder length hair is considered most attractive.What kind of hair is thought attractive differs from culture to culture and according to the fashion of the day. These range from a “normal” crew cut to long plaited hair, attention catching dreadlocks or even the Mohawk style that has all the hair standing on end. The hairstyles of famous film stars have always influenced the fashions of the day.Among certain communities like the Sikhs, men and women are not allowed to cut their hair. The men wear a turban covering their hair. People put in beads, plait hair, perm it, dye it, leave it open or tie it all for a reason – to look appealing.That does not mean that a clean-shaven head is not attractive. While Samson might have lost all his powers after having his hair chopped off by Delilah, Hollywood actor Yul Brynner is a bold example of baldness.",

    "title": "Why is Snow White?",
    "article": "I am sure like my two kids, all of seven and three years, you too may find the cold in Delhi a bit too extreme. It is cold and clammy and some days it is foggy making it dangerous to drive. Some days I would like them to be adequately muffled up in warm winter clothing, while they feel quite comfortable running around in a sweater and shorts! But most days it was grumble, grumble, grumble!Last year I found my children complaining about the winter cold a bit too often. So I decided to take them out on a well-deserved winter holiday. The idea thrilled them but their faces fell when I told them that I intended to take them to hill station. A hill station in winters -I am sure they felt that I had gone senile quite early in life.Why is Snow White?However, I wanted them to see snow so that they would learn to appreciate the beauty of the cold crisp winter and the fresh air of the mountains. So we packed our bags and set off to Shimla, a hill station in the state of Himachal Pradesh.After a thoroughly enjoyable drive we reached Shimla. It was very cold and to add to all this it started raining. The next day too there was no sign of sun. Just when we were planning our next move it started raining again. Suddenly we could see tiny powdery white flakes falling from the sky. Soon the entire place was full of white snow. For the kids who were seeing snow for the first time, it was probably the most beautiful sight.They were fascinated with these cotton flakes of snow falling from the sky. When I explained to them that it was only frozen water, they immediately turned around and asked me, “if the ice in the fridge was colourless then why was snow white?”A snowflake is formed when water vapour in the air suddenly freezes. It turns from gas to solid without having any time to turn into liquid. The currents in the air make these crystals go up and down in the atmosphere. As the crystals do this, they begin to gather around tiny particles that are in the clouds. When a group of ice crystals is big enough, it floats down on the earth in the form of snowflake.The result is a six-rayed ice crystal of delicate quality. And it is the reflection of light from these surfaces that make the snow look white. While all the branches of a snowflake are always identical, the arrangement of these branches is different in each case.Though these snowflakes are crystals with six sides, no two snowflakes are exactly alike. But they can be classified into different types of crystals. The six-sided shape of the ice crystal is because of the shape and bonding of the water molecules. Basically there are six different types of snow crystals: needles, columns, plates, columns capped with plates, dendrites and stars.We can only think of the snow as being white, but there have actually been cases where coloured snow has fallen. There have been cases where blue, green black and even red snow has been seen! One famous case was even reported by the Charles Darwin. During one of his expeditions, he noticed that the hoofs of the mules were becoming stained red as they walked through the snow. The red snow was caused by the presence of certain tiny plants, called algae, which had been in the atmosphere when the snow formed.Needless to say, we stayed in Shimla two days longer than we had originally planned to – obviously the kids were not ready to leave! Now at least they do not grumble at the extreme cold but they have now taken acute interest in skis and skates and sledges and reindeer. . .",

    "title": "Why is a Hippopotamus called a River Horse?",
    "article": "Among Africa’s unusual creatures is a barrel-shaped gigantic animal, the hippopotamus (plural hippopotami). The hippo is the third largest land animal after the elephant and the rhino. Slightly smaller but heavier than a white rhino, a hippo can weigh nearly 1,800 kg. The animal is huge and barrel shaped nearly 12 feet long and five feet at its shoulder, with a short thick neck and small ears.Hippos, or to use their biological name, hippopotamus amphibious literally means ‘river horse’. Recent DNA (a test for genes) has revealed that the hippo is more closely related to cetaceans (whales and dolphins) than to any other artiodactyls (even-toed hoofed mammal).Hippos are hoofed vegetarians, feeding on grass, fallen fruit, and occasionally on cultivated crops such as sugar cane or corn during the night.Hippos prefer rivers with deep water and nearby reed beds and grasslands, but are also found in salt-water areas near river mouths. They are well- adapted to stay in water and are excellent swimmers. Their ears and nostrils located at the top of the head – close automatically when the animal is under water.Why is a hippopotamus called a river horse?These animals prefer to stay in water through the day coming out only at night to forage for food. This search for food may take them five miles inland and so they liberally mark the path with their dung and urine to help them find their way back home before dawn.Adults may consume about 100 pounds of grass cutting the grass off with their broad lips and not with their teeth like most grazers.Hippo hide has practically no hair, and its smooth skin is quite delicate exuding a red, oily liquid that keeps the skin moist and protected when it is out of water. This has often led first-time explorers to arrive at the mistaken assumption that hippos sweat blood.Hippos have large tusk-like incisors and canines that grow continuously. These tusks are of ivory, and even more valuable than an elephant’s because they do not turn yellow with age. It is a fact that US President George Washington’s false teeth were carved from the tusks of a hippopotamus and not made of wood, as is commonly believed!A hippo has the widest jaws on any land mammal and when it opens its mouth to yawn the mouth measures two feet across! But despite its size and bulk, a hippopotamus can easily outrun a human.A hippo herd usually contains ten to fifteen animals consisting of a dominant male, a few subordinate males, and several females and their young.One calf is born at a time, after a gestation of around 230 days. Births usually occur in months of heavy rainfall, but can occur year-round. Young hippos will also bask on their mother’s back. Young males often form separate “bachelor” groups along the outskirts of the main herd.The hippo’s present-day range is confined to sub-Saharan Africa. In ancient times, hippos were found as far north as the Nile delta. In fact, images of the hippopotamus are fairly common in ancient Egyptian art. Today, its range is restricted to the lakes, rivers, and swamps of East and central Africa.Most claim that hippos are docile creatures while others maintain that hippos are aggressive, short-tempered beasts. Nearly all African explorers and hunters – Dr Livingston, Stanley, Burton, and Selous, etc – have had boating mishaps with hippos, though it is not known if they provoked the hippo.Hippos are also extremely protective of their young and there is no animal more dangerous than a hippo if you happen to come between it and their young.However, the hippo does give ample warning with an ear-splitting bellow like the roar of a lion and by opening its mouth in a huge yawn. The hippo’s yawn is not a sign of sleepiness or boredom but is actually a threatening gesture. A single bite can snap a small boat in half.Unfortunately the hippo is poached both for its ivory tusks and for its skin. Rawhide whips are made of its skin while the tusks fetch a hefty sum in the black market.",

    "title": "Why is it Harder to Walk Uphill?",
    "article": "Raju heard the familiar cry of the ice-cream seller reach his ears, clear as a bell, even from his fourth floor apartment. He flew out of the flat and bounded down the stairs four steps at a time. The lift being under temporary repair, he had to take the stairs. He arrived downstairs a little breathless, and extremely impatient to have his ice-cream.After buying it, he decided to rush home so he could eat it in peace. The climbing upstairs bit was a pain though. It always was. He had barely gone one flight of stairs when his knees began to hurt, and he felt majorly out of breath.Why is it Harder to Walk Uphill?This fact never ceased to amaze Raju – why going up a flight of stairs in his building got him exhausted, but coming down the same flight of stairs was a cakewalk.Do you know why this happens?We know that the earth attracts everything towards its centre. This is due to its force of gravity. When we get away from the earth’s surface, we have to do more work to overcome the force of gravity.On the other hand when we come down from a height, the gravitational pull helps our movement. While going upstairs, Raju has to lift the weight of his body against the gravity and greater energy is required to do this than for walking downstairs.When Raju is climbing the stairs, his muscles have to do more work. For this the heart has to pump more blood to the cells and as a consequence lungs have to do more work to remove the carbon-di-oxide from the heart and replenish it with oxygen.A Himalayan sherpa porter carries a large load uphill along the Everest Base Camp in Nepal. R.M. Nunes / Shutterstock.comIt’s the same when we go uphill. The steeper the climb, the more is the work to be done. The more quickly we breathe as a result. In comparison to the energy required for walking on a horizontal plane, the total value of the extra energy needed for climbing is the weight of the body times the height we have to climb.If we climb a mountain through two different paths – one steep and the other less so, we would feel greater fatigue in case of the steeper one. When we come down a hill, very little energy is required because the body is carried down the slope due to earth’s gravitational pull. Our muscles do less work as a result and we do notfeel tired while descending.",

    "title": "Why is the Ball-point Pen Called So?",
    "article": "Writing is one of the most important inventions. Humans first used brushes for writing, then thick reeds were used. Feathers were used in medieval Europe for writing.In the mid-19 century, metallic pens and nibs were widely used, while the fountain pen was produced in 1884 by the American, LE Waterman. However, these pens had a lot of problems. The ink would spill and blot very frequently and writing was cumbersome.The first ball-point pen was invented by an Hungarian journalist, Ladislo Biro, in 1938. Biro had noticed that the type of ink used in newspaper printing dried quickly and did not smudge the paper. He decided to make a pen using the same type of ink. However, that thick ink could not flow through the normal pen nib, so he tried something else. And that is how the ball-point-pen was born.Why is the Ball-point Pen Called So?The anatomy of a ball-point penThe ball-point pen has a hollow body in which an ink-refill is inserted. The refill has a thick ink and so it doesn’t leak like a fountain pen. The part of the refill that writes has a tiny metallic ball, which is partially outside the refill body and partially in contact with the thick ink.It is to this ball that the ball-point pen owes its name.When the pen moves across the surface of a paper, the ball rotates. In the process, the side of the ball which is in contact with the ink touches the paper, leaving the ink mark. As the pen slides over the paper the ball keeps rotating, bringing the ink to the surface and enabling you to write.The World War II connectionDuring the second World War, the British Air Force used the ball-point pen. The air force needed a new type of pen one that would not leak at higher altitudes, as the fountain pen did when the plane was in the air. This lead to the popularity and widespread use of the ball-point pen.A ball-point-pen has several uses. As the ink is thick, it doesn’t require a blotting paper and nor does the writing smudge when water spills in the paper. The pen writes faster and and can write even on rough surfaces. However, the writer’s hand gets tired while writing with the ball-point-pen. This is because a greater amount of pressure is required to write with it.So the next time you pick up your ball-point pen to write, look closely at the tip. You will surely see the tiny ball which does all the wonder.",

    "title": "Why is the Bridge of Sighs so Called?",
    "article": "The Bridge of Sighs (Ponte de Sospiri), is in Venice, Italy, and connects the inquisitor’s room in the east side of the Doge’s palace with the state’s prison or prigioni over the Rio de Palazzo.Work on the Doge’s palace (residence of the Duke) or Palazzo Ducale was begun in the 14th century and got its present shape only by the 16th century. The palace was not only the Doge’s residence and thus contained the inquisitor’s (judge) office, it also housed many other institutions like lawyers offices, the Chancellery, Naval Offices, etc.The Bridge of Sighs across the Rio di Palazzo is one of over 400 bridges across the 100 or so canals that connect the city of Venice. It was built by Antonio Contino in 1600.Why is the Bridge of Sighs (Ponte de Sospiri) so Called?The bridge became the path by which the prisoners were transported from the prison to the inquisitor’s office. Its name stems from the popular belief of sadness and the sighs of condemned prisoners as they were led through it to the executioner.However, it was only in the 19th century that it came to be called the ‘Bridge of Sighs’ after Lord Byron’s famous reference in his poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage “I stood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs, a palace and prison on each hand”.In reality, the days of inquisitions and torture were over by the time the bridge was built and only small time crooks were kept in the prison cells.The prison building is older than the Doge’s palace and was at one time used during the inquisition by the Church during the Middle Ages (when people were suspected of being witches or non believers and tortured).",

    "title": "Why is the Dead Sea dead?",
    "article": "The Dead Sea is indeed a very scary name for a lake. It is called so because nothing lives in it. There are no sea weeds or plants, no fish either. This is because the Dead Sea is nearly six times as salty as the ocean.It also contains many other dissolved minerals, including magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and potassium chloride in large quantities. Whereas in fresh water, only minute quantities of these minerals are found. The high concentration of salt makes plant or animal life impossible.The oceans and seas combined cover nearly three-fourth of the Earth’s surface. These sources of water are unfit for drinking as they are salty.Why is the Dead Sea dead?Why is sea water salty?Many minerals like Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium and Silica are found on the surface of Earth. Every time it rains, tiny amounts of these minerals are carried into rivers, and ultimately to the seas, along with rainwater. The two most abundant elements in sea water are Sodium and Chlorine. These combine to form salt, making the sea (and ocean) water salty.Why is the Dead Sea saltier than other water bodies?The Dead Sea is actually a lake. It is 77 kilometres (48 miles) long and between 5 and 18 kilometres (3 and 11 miles) wide. It is situated between Jordan and Israel.The Jordan river and some small canals drain into it. But, unlike other seas or lakes, no river originates from the Dead Sea. As a result, the water depletes only by evaporation. In this process, only water evaporates, leaving the salt behind. The rate at which the Dead Sea loses water is far greater than the rate at which it gets replenished with rainfall. As a result, over a period of time, the water has become saltier.A very interesting fact about the Dead Sea is that you can never drown in it. In fact, you can float on the surface like a log of wood. Since the amount of dissolved minerals in the water is very high, the density of the water is also very high.For a body to float on water, it has to displace water equal to its own weight. This is the reason why a ship floats, but a steel ball sinks. Since the density of the water in the Dead Sea is very high, the amount of water which a body needs to displace in order to float is very low. So you can actually read a book while you are floating on its surface.Consider this, many years ago the Dead Sea was much larger and not quite as salty as it is today. Since then, evaporation has resulted in the loss of water, and the Dead Sea is much smaller and a whole lot saltier. In fact, the same logic applies to all the other seas and oceans, which have no outlets. They too are getting saltier each year.",

    "title": "Why is the Mediterranean Sea Blue?",
    "article": "We know that about seventy one per cent of the earth’s surface is covered with water. The earth’s three main Oceans are the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.The Atlantic Ocean is a great mass of water that separates Europe and Africa from America. It is shaped like a great hour-glass-with a ‘waist’ where Africa and South America bulge out towards each other. Although in area it is less than half the Pacific, it has many ‘secondary’ seas, such as the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.It is actually possible to distinguish where the waters of the Mediterranean Sea meet the Atlantic Ocean. This is because the former appears blue and the latter green.Why is this so?The Mediterranean Sea lies between southern Europe, Africa and south-west Asia. It is linked to the Atlantic Ocean through the narrow Strait of Gibraltar in the west and to the Black Sea in the north-east, via the sea of Marmara. The varying colours of the two depend mainly on the amount of sunlight scattered from their surface.The colour of the scattered light depends upon the substances dissolved in seawater. Generally, of the seven colours of sunlight, blue is scattered most. That is why most oceans appear blue. However, in the case of the Atlantic Ocean, the decaying plants on the ocean bed produce a green effect. When these plants decay, yellow pigments are released which get dissolved in the water. This water now scatters both blue and yellow light and the resulting mixture produces the characteristic greenish shade.",

    "title": "Why was the Berlin Wall Built?",
    "article": "A few tentative steps across Checkpoint Charlie and you were transported to a different world. One side had McDonalds, Coke, Toyota cars and a democratically elected government. Across the Checkpoint, was a world of state-owned factories, rows and rows of identical apartments, and a self-imposed government. This was the world of the two Berlins divided by barbed wire, watch dogs, tanks, and an imposing wall.In 1945, following World War II, Germany was divided into two countries – East Germany and West Germany. East Germany was controlled by the communist regime of the Soviet Union while West Germany became a democracy supported by the United States. Berlin, the former capital city, although entirely within East German borders, was also split into two.Why was the Berlin Wall Built? 360b / Shutterstock.comOn August 13, 1961, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) decided to block off East Berlin and West Berlin by means of a barbed wire. Streets were torn up, and barricades erected. Rail lines and the subway between East and West Berlin was torn up.People of East Berlin and the GDR were no longer allowed to enter West Berlin disrupting 60,000 commuters who were employed in West Berlin. Within the year, construction work began to build a solid wall separating the two cities.By September, people living near the border were forcibly evacuated from their houses. Citizens living in close proximity to the border had to register themselves with the police. Exactly a year after the division, an 18-year-old boy, Peter Fechter, of East Berlin, was shot down by the East Berlin border patrol when he attempted to escape over the wall.The border separating West Berlin and East Berlin had a total length of 166 km. It cut through 192 streets, 97 of them leading to East Berlin and 95 into the GDR. However since the border division was staggered, a solid 107 km long wall was erected. The wall was made up of concrete segments erected to a height of four metres (roughly 13 feet), with an additional concrete tube on top.On the side of East Berlin bright illumination lit up the entire area. Further a trench was dug to prevent vehicles from breaking through. Not content with these precautions, the area was patrolled day and night, with a separate corridor guarded by vicious guard dogs, watchtowers, and a second wall. If by chance some one did manage to cross these barriers, they were shot without a warning.Many families were separated by the erection of this barricade. Relatives who wanted to see their loved ones in East Berlin had to have a valid permit. For 28 years the Wall became a physical separator and cloaked the goings on behind Communist Russia and created a figurative Iron curtain.In 1989, after months of discussion, East Germany decided to tentatively open the barrier. On November 9, Günter Schabowski, leader of East Berlin’s communist party, stated that the border would be opened for ‘private trips abroad’.That day, the entire world watched some truly amazing scenes on TV as East Berliners poured through the checkpoints to be greeted by West Berliners. Champagne flowed and people danced on the wall at Brandenburg Gate, the gateway between the two cities.On November 10, demolition work on the wall began with the aim of creating new border crossings. Two days later, a checkpoint at the Potsdamer Platz was opened, and on December 22, a checkpoint for pedestrians was opened at the Brandenburg Gate. Souvenir hunters hammered out pieces of the wall and chunks of the wall were even sold.On July 1 1990, an economic, monetary and social union between East and West Germany was formed uniting the two cities. The only reminder of the wall is a red line painted on the pavement at the former ‘Checkpoint Charlie’ to mark the course of the former Berlin wall.In August 13 1998, a wall memorial was inaugurated at the Bernauer Strasse (former GDR) consisting of a portion of the Berlin wall.",

    "title": "Why were the 1904 Olympics Such a Disaster?",
    "article": "The 2000 Summer Olympics at Sydney were a millennium extravaganza unparalelled in the history of the Games. Techno-wizardry was at its best and the spectacular pageantry and the actual Games thrilled millions of viewers worldwide.Hosting the Games is big business. What the host country spends is trifling compared to the amount of money it receives by way of advertising revenue and tourist influx.Since 1896 when the modern Olympic Games were first held, the Games have undergone many upheavals. They were launched in 1896 to promote sports and test the sporting skills of humans in various categories. Over the years though, the true spirit has been lost as participating countries turn a blind eye to notions of honour and fair play. Instead, the focus is on winning either by hook or crook.The history of the Games is peppered with anecdotes of comedies of errors and the crookedness of the participants. In this respect the 1904 St. Louis Games were arguably the most disastrous Olympics ever.The St. Louis Games could hardly be called international games. The entire event lasted for only five days from Monday, August 29 to Saturday, September 3, 1904 with no events scheduled for Friday.Right form the start, they were different. The Olympics were not intended as competition between countries but as competition among amateur sportspersons, it was up to the athlete to travel to the Games at his own expense.Thus participants at the St. Louis Olympics consisted mainly of Americans and Canadians – of the 681 athletes, 525 were from the United States. Needless to say, the Games were farcical.Why were the 1904 St. Louis Olympics Such a Disaster? Solodov Alexey / Shutterstock.comTo start with, a separate category called ‘Anthropology Days’ was introduced. Minority communities and tribals had to compete in this separate category and were pitted against one another.The Anthropology Days of the 1904 Olympics were a ‘scientific experiment’ with participation from ‘costumed members of the uncivilized tribes’. This included Pygmies, Filipinos, various Native American tribes, including two South Africans, students at Orange Free State University, Len Tau and Jan Mashiani, who were billed as ‘Zulu savages’. Zulus belong to a tribe in Africa.These participants were to compete in such events such as mud fighting, rock throwing, greased-pole climbing and spear throwing. This was the white man’s way of showing that these people weren’t ‘civilized’ yet!The actual Olympics started with famous howlers such as Hungary’s Zoltan Halmay who won the 100m and 50m freestyle. Originally, Halmay beat American J. Scott Leary by a foot in the 50m event. However, the American judge ruled that Leary had won. This ruling resulted in a brawl and the judges ordered a rematch. Halmay won again.The other athletic event was the marathon. After the initial laps around the stadium, the runners embarked on a dusty, unpaved course. Leading the runners was a group of horsemen to clear the trail along the way. The horsemen were followed by doctors, judges, and reporters in motorcars. The result: the runners were literally forced to eat dust.The first man to cross the finish line was American Fred Lorz. When he entered the stadium, the crowd roared to support the local hero. However, his victory was short-lived as officials learned that Lorz had hitched a ride in an automobile. He was even seen waving to spectators and fellow runners along the way. Lorz was immediately banned for life from any future amateur competition.The second man in was a Britisher Thomas Hicks who ran for the American team. But Hicks victory too was short-lived as he collapsed halfway. His trainers had given him an oral dose of strychnine sulfate mixed with raw egg-white to keep him going. In the end, Hicks was actually supported by two of his trainers so that he could cross the finish line.However that’s not the end of the marathon story. The third colourful character in this race was a Cuban named Felix Carvajal. Felix wanted to run the marathon but he had no money. So he quit his job and decided to raise funds by running around the city square. Somehow he managed to raise enough to come to New Orleans.Unfortunately, Felix lost his money in a gambling game. He managed to hitchhike his way to St Louis. Carvajal lacked any type of running gear and so was dressed in long sleeves shirt and trousers. The officials were forced to postpone the start of the marathon for several minutes while he cut the sleeves off his shirt and the legs off his pants.During the race, Felix didn’t seem to fatigue easily. He clowned with the crowd and spectators all the way. But the long distance made him hungry and he took a detour and ate some green apples. This nearly cost Felix the race as he developed stomach cramps. Eventually, Felix got back in the race and managed to come in fourth place.Finally, the St. Louis Olympics came to an ignominious end. The Games were such a disaster that the Olympic Committee was forced to hold an interim Olympic games in 1906 at Athens, in an attempt to revive the prestige of the flagging Olympic movement.",

    "article": "Why is it so tough to get ketchup out of the bottle?When you overturn a sauce bottle that has been left untouched for some time, chances are, either the sauce will not come out at all or a gigantic blob will plop down on your plate. Getting ketchup to ‘flow’ out of the bottle can be quite an ordeal.However, if you shake the bottle before overturning it, the thick gooey ketchup will flow out more freely.Why does this happen?This strange property of changing from a gel like thickness (half liquid-half solid, like your toothpaste) to a free flowing liquid and back again is called thixotropy (pronounced thick-saw-tro-pea).The word has been derived from the Greek thixis, which means “the act of handling” and trope, meaning “change”. So a ketchup is a semi-liquid substance which changes on being handled.This happens because of the shape of the ketchup molecules. They are in the form of long chains. When the ketchup bottle is left untouched for some time, the molecule chains coil up together in a jumble.When the bottle is shaken, the molecules break apart and become loose. Hence, the ketchup starts flowing.You can even make your own thixotropic substance! For that, you need one cup of cold water and one and a half cups of cornstarch. Pour the water into a shallow dish. Add the cornstarch to the water slowly, one teaspoon of at a time, stirring all the while. Continue till you have exhausted all the cornstarch.Strike the surface of the water-cornstarch mixture with the back of a spoon. The mixture will not splatter like any other liquid. This is true for any thixotropic mixture.If you drop a small hard object, such as a tennis ball, on its surface, the mixture becomes firm and does not splash. This is because cornstarch and water molecules have fairly fixed positions. They cannot move freely under pressure and behave more like a solid. However, if there is no pressure, the mixture behaves like a liquid.Quicksand is also a thixotropic mixture, the more the pressure you apply the harder it gets to free yourself. The best way of getting out of quicksand is to apply force very slowly.",

    "title": "Why's the Sun Red during Sunrise and Sunset?",
    "article": "As day breaks, a reddish-white ball of light that we call the sun, rises. This red haze gives way to a golden-white sheen as the day advances and reappears when the sun sets in the evening. Does the sun really change colours, or does it only seem so? The explanation lies in-between.Light from the sun consists of three kinds of radiation – ultra-violet rays, visible light and infra-red rays. Unlike visible light, ultra-violet rays and infra-red rays cannot be seen.The visible light’s rays are white and consist of seven colours – violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red (known simply as VIBGYOR).The earth’s dust, gas and air particles scatter the sun’s light in different directions. Violet light has a peculiar property due to which it gets scattered the most. Red light gets scattered the least.The rising and setting sunWhy’s the Sun Red during Sunrise and Sunset?At sunrise the earth is rotating towards the sun. Similarly, during sunset, the earth is rotating away from the sun. During these times the sunlight has to travel at an angle and thus cover a longer distance through the atmosphere. It encounters more obstacles in its path. Most of the colours, like green and violet, get scattered before the light reaches the earth. Since red is scattered the least, it is this colour that we see as it reaches us.During noontime, the sun is directly overhead and it appears white. This is because the sunlight has to cover a much lesser distance through the atmosphere and it faces less obstacles. Hence, it escapes a great deal of scattering.In fact, if we were to calculate the distance the sun’s rays have to travel through the denser part of the atmosphere (roughly around 150 kms) to any point on earth, we would find that this journey of the rays is almost 50 times more at sunrise and sunset than at noon.",

    "title": "Your Mobile Phone Has a Bug",
    "article": "When people talk of a virus these days, chances are that they are talking about computer viruses that have the power to wipe out all the valuable work they may have stored in their computers. Imagine, this virus has the power to make military systems, giant banks, airports, hospitals and traffic systems come to a halt!The softer the name of the virus, the deadlier it may get. Remember the recent Love Bug virus which created such trouble all over the world? It came as an ‘I Love You’ message and anyone who opened that love-filled e-mail, was caught in the virus trap.What does a computer virus do? It targets electronic objects that are programmed. The virus spreads through connections between these electronic devices. For virus spreading experts, e-mail is a favourite method of unleashing their destructive weapon.Your Mobile Phone Has a Bug: Illustration of a virus on a smartphoneBut scientists warn that this is not the worst that can happen. There is more. For people are also connected through phones. The next virus may actually target mobile phones, especially those that are programmed to do many tasks apart from just communicating. It would then be easy for a virus to infect those programmes and create major disorder.For example, these viruses may have the power to record your phone conversations and make others hear them. They could create problems with your electronic money accounts, or they could create a mountain of telephone bills for calls you never made. And that would be a disaster. A report on this was published in the ‘New Scientist’ recently.One way out would be to have simpler phones with not so many different functions. That way there would be fewer programmes for the virus to attack. But mobile phone manufacturers are in a fix. People no longer want an electronic item to perform just one task. They want more and more functions added on. That would mean more software programmes to make the mobile phone perform all those functions. And that means the possibility of more viruses.",
