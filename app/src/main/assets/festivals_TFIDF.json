Many Catholics will fast completely on Ash Wednesday or just have bread and water. It is one of only two days in the Catholic calendar when fasting is required. The other day is Good Friday. Ash Wednesday falls between February the 4th and March the 10th each year, depending on the date of Easter.\n\nIt is called Ash Wednesday because priests draw a small cross on the foreheads of people in church. The cross is a sign that you have regretted your sins and want to cleanse your soul. It is tradition to keep the cross on one’s forehead until the sun sets. In other churches, people write their sins on a small piece of paper, which is then burnt and turned into ash. In Biblical times, people covered themselves in ash to express their sorrow for their sins. Priests say a prayer to show we are all mortal and will return to ashes after we die. A traditional prayer is: “God our Father, you create us from the dust of the earth.

He added that: “As the population grows, and with it the demand for agriculture production, traditional systems of managing the land are collapsing.” Mr. Ban said the UN must work harder to reduce poverty and protect dry lands. He told the world: “The time has come for the international community to recognize that dry land, where nearly half of the world’s poor live, is not waste land. Rather, they are potential areas for agricultural intensification for both food and energy needs.”\nSources: http://www.wikipedia.org/ and assorted sites.", "keyword": ["land", "desertification", "drought", "degradation", "desert"]}, {"title": "Donut Day", "article": "National Doughnut Day is on the first Friday of June every year.

In most cities around the world, it is very easy to find a donut shop where you can sit down with friends and eat your favourite kinds of donut. It is almost a part of modern youth culture. Dunkin Donuts is probably the most famous, but new chains like Krispy Kreme are making a big impact in the donut world.\n\nNational Doughnut Day started in 1938 as a charity event. The aim was to raise money for the needy during America’s Great Depression. A secondary reason was to honor American women who served doughnuts to U.S. soldiers fighting in France. Conditions were difficult to cook sweets for the soldiers so the women came up with the idea of making doughnuts. The soldiers loved them. They even made doughnuts cooked in oil inside the metal helmets of soldiers. No one knows why they are called donuts. They are definitely not nuts.

It is the most important Christian celebration. The date of Easter Sunday changes every year, and that changes the date of all the important holy days that come before Easter. It falls between late March and late May. Easter is so important because Christians believe that Jesus rose from the dead, two days after he died on the cross. Jesus’ dead body was buried in a cave on Good Friday and two days later the stone that covered the cave’s entrance had been moved and Jesus’ body had gone. Various people saw Jesus in the following days and his followers understood God had raised him from the dead. Historians say this happened some time between 26 and 36 AD.\n\nPeople celebrate Easter in many ways around the world. It is a very busy time for churches. Many Christians light a special Paschal candle on the evening before Easter. This represents the rising of Christ. There are special songs and hymns which people sing in church. Children like Easter because their parents and grandparents give them chocolate Easter eggs, a sign of new birth. Schoolchildren usually decorate eggs and display them in their school or give them as gifts. Other things associated with Easter are the Easter Bunny and spring flowers like irises.

Several people also paint eggs or emboss chocolate eggs with sugar flowers to gift to friends and relatives.But what is Easter? Easter Sunday falls on the Sunday after Good Friday and on this day Easter eggs are available in the market – that is what most of us know. In reality, the preparation for Easter starts with a fast 40 days earlier, on Ash Wednesday.Easter’s Here [Illustration by Shinod AP]Also, did you know that Easter is associated with Passover, which is a Jewish festival? Or that because there is no fixed date for Passover, even the date for Easter is not fixed? Well, the fact is that Easter can fall on any Sunday between March 22 and April 25.But before going into these details, let’s see what Easter is all about.Easter comes from the word ‘eastre’ or ‘ostara’. The preparation for Easter begins with Ash Wednesday, which is so called because the priest marks the foreheads of people with ash, in the form of a cross. Ash Wednesday always falls on the seventh Wednesday before Easter.Ash Wednesday also marks the beginning of Lent, the season of fasting for Christians across the world. Starting Ash Wednesday, Christians fast for 40 days in preparation for Easter. This is because Jesus had fasted for 40 days before he started his public life as a preacher.Most Christians avoid eating meat and taking liquor during this period. Traditionally, these fast days are supposed to be spent in fasting, repentance and prayer.This period of fasting ends on Good Friday, the day when Jesus Christ was crucified. Before dying, he told his disciples that he would rise again two days later. And he did. That is why Easter, which always falls on a Sunday, is celebrated as a victory of life over death. It is a day of joy and happiness and is celebrated with great fervour.Interestingly, although Christmas, or the day of Christ’s birth is fixed for December 25, Easter does not have a fixed date. The Christian festival of Easter is associated with the Jewish festival of Passover because Christ’s arrest, trial, crucifixion and resurrection happened during this eight-day Jewish festival. Or at least, that’s what happened according to a Reader’s Digest publication, Why in the World.Easter is a festival and holiday celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the deadDuring Passover, the Jews thank God for saving them from slavery in Egypt. The Jewish slaves escaped from their masters and were led to the Promised Land by Moses.Since the Jews base their calendar on the rotation of the moon, and not the sun, the date for Passover keeps changing. Hence, Easter too is not on a fixed date. It is celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon after March 21.For centuries the Church has debated over why Easter cannot be on a fixed date. Several people also want to disassociate Easter from Passover. But how does one do that? Different churches have not agreed to any one proposal, yet.The Church may debate over Easter and when it should fall, but in actual fact, Easter has its roots in an even older festival. The period before Christianity was born is called the ‘pagan’ era by the Christians. Pagan means the belief in many Gods.Before Easter became a Christian festival, the pagans celebrated Eastre or Ostara. Ostara is the name of the goddess of spring among the Germanic tribes of northern Europe. The pagans celebrated Eastre to welcome spring after a hard winter. A time when everything was new – new leaves sprung up on the trees and the birds were mating.In fact, the Easter egg also originates from that era. The ancient Egyptians and Romans gifted eggs to each other because they symbolised a new life. Sometimes, colours, which depicted certain flowers, were painted on the eggs. The early Christians carried on this tradition and gradually, the eggs came to symbolise Easter – while their original meaning was forgotten.", "keyword": ["easter", "egg", "passover", "fixed", "ash"]}, {"title": "Eid in Yusufpur", "article": "Guess what guys??

The workplace is usually not such a fun place. It is often a stressful place to be and there is little time to relax and have fun. Fun at Work Day changes this a little so that people’s jobs are not all work and no play. The idea behind this event is that workers perform better if they can relax and laugh. Production increases and there is better customer service. It is also better for the health of the staff. Having fun at work also creates better relations, especially if the bosses join in and share the fun.\n\nHaving fun at work is an important part of many large companies today. Internet companies like Google and Yahoo encourage their workers to relax and do things at work to let off steam. Workers set up mini basketball hoops in their offices and people can wear what they want and decorate their desks. Fun at work has been studied by experts. Psychologist and author Matt Weinstein wrote a book on management called ‘Managing to Have Fun’. He says: \"Successful companies are discovering that fun at work helps them reduce stress, increase productivity, and boost employee morale.\" Perhaps every day should be fun at work. It would certainly make people happier, and that’s what life’s all about.\nSources: http://www.wikipedia.org/ and assorted sites.", "keyword": ["fun", "relax", "company", "worker", "yahoo"]}, {"title": "Fun'tastic Ramlila, Dandiya, Jatra", "article": "Whether it is a pesky 11-year-old Dashrath struggling to maintain his flowing beard during the enactment of the Ramayana in a street Ramlila, or handsome young artistes enacting Rama and Sita on a professional stage, the feeling is the same for the viewers.They know the story of Sita and Ram by heart, but every year they wait with bated breath for yet another performance of the Ramayana in performances across the country, and specially in northern India. It is as if they are seeing it for the first time. In the actors they see the epic come alive; the actors, too, do not remain untouched by the fervent chants of the audience every now and then, ‘Bol Siyapati Ram ki Jai’ (Hail Sita’s husband Rama’)In Gujarat, Dussehra is unthinkable without the hugely popular and highly energetic men’s folk dance of the Dandiya-ras or the Garba by women. And, in West Bengal or any Bengali-locality in India celebrating Durga Puja, life is incomplete without the melodrama of the Jatra folk theatre.Fun’tastic world of RamlilaThese performances enable people to get together and feel a sense of community, though each individual may see something different in them. After all, epics like the Ramayana are full of role models for humans – the ideal ruler, the ideal son, the ideal husband or wife. And depending on who the viewers are and what their situation is, they see these performances differently. Plays in the Jatra form also touch upon everyday values and situations.Few traditional performances match the popularity of the Ramlilas though, which are a dramatised depiction of events in the life of Rama. These trace their origins to more than 300 years ago when the Hindi poet Tulsidas dramatised certain portions of his Ramcharitmanas and presented them at Banaras (Varanasi).Different areas of the city of Banaras were named after places in the epic Ramayana and Ramlila plays were enacted there over several nights. The presentation culminated on Dusshera with the burning of the effigies of Ravana and his relatives.It continues to be a colourful affair to this day in Banaras, whose neighbourhoods are choc-a-bloc with Ramlilas. The performances go on at their own pace: in one locality Rama and Sita are getting married; in another, Sita is being abducted; and in yet another, Rama’s forces are fighting Ravana.The Mother of all Ramlilas – in BanarasBy far the most spectacular and popular Ramlila in India is held at Ramnagar on the bank of the Ganga, near Banaras. Enacted over a period of 30 days, this Ramlila is a moving performance – literally. If the action moves from a palace to a jungle, the acting area changes too, and the audiences also move with the performance.Different scenes are enacted at different places, which in turn are associated with the actual locales of Ramayana. The Ramlila performance becomes a moveable feast for the eyes!From Dandiya ras to Disco DandiyaOr take the Dandiya ras and Garba in Gujarat, whose popularity is growing day by day. The Dandiya had its origins in the Limbdi region of the state, and was a dance based on the Ramayana, performed only by men. Dressed in flounced jackets, they beat short lacquered sticks as they quickstep in a whirling circle to the beat of drums, songs and cymbals.Today the Dandiya is extremely popular among all Gujaratis, and is also catching up among other Indians, particularly young Indians ( very few festivals give boys and girls the opportunity to mix freely and dance the way Dandiya does).As a result, we now have Disco-Dandiya, with the city-bred hip set swinging to the beat of the music with the same abandon as they do to trance or techno music, the latest fads in western music.While the Dandiya-Ras has a relatively recent origin, the Garba, danced by women, dates much further back in time. Besides Navaratri, the Garba is also danced during the Holi and Basant Panchami festivals. Joyful songs and light, graceful, circular movements are typical of the Garba, which celebrates the Krishna theme. It is the favourite dance at community cultural gatherings.The Jatra of BengalUnlike the Dandiya-ras or the Ramlila, which are closely linked with the festivals that they are performed in, the Jatra, Bengal’s most popular form of theatre, is not historically linked with the Durga Puja. And that is why it can be performed anytime and not just during the Puja.Still, the Puja is the one time when interest in this performing art peaks among people, and one finds the state’s most famous Jatra troupes engaged in frantic tours across the state and outside.The Jatra had its origin in Vaishanava musical plays based on the Krishna theme introduced in Bengal by the 16th century Bhakti saint, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Today however, Jatras rarely cover the religious aspect, and deal with historical, social and political themes, mostly contemporary.A Jatra performance is marked by loud and dramatic acting, high-pitched dialogue delivery, much dancing and singing, glittering music and rich music.

Since the birthday falls on the full moon day of the month Kartik, that is the day that Sikhs all over the world celebrate the birth of their first guru.Gurpurab – the birth of Guru NanakGurpurbs are Sikh festivals which celebrate the lives of Guru Nanak and the nine gurus who followed him. Guru Nanak was born in 1469 in what is now Pakistan. At the age of 30 he mysteriously disappeared for three days. When he reappeared, he began to preach the Sikh faith and spent the rest of his life teaching, writing and travelling around the world to discuss religion with Muslims and Hindus.Sikhs celebrate Guru Nanak’s birthday and the other Gurpurbs with an Akhand Path, a reading of the Sikh holy scriptures, the Guru Granth Sahib, continuously from beginning to end. This is done by a team of Sikh men and women, each reading for 2-3 hours over 48 hours, beginning two days before and ending early on the morning of the birthday.On the day before the birthday, processions are held in India and in some parts of England. These are led by five people representing the original Panj Pyare (Five Beloved Ones) and followed by singers, musicians and even teams of people demonstrating martial arts.The Gurdwaras (places where Sikhs go to pray) are decorated with flowers, flags and posters depicting various aspects of Sikhism. Often they are also illuminated. Sikhs join together to sing, pray and eat together. On the morning of the anniversary, celebrations begin early, at around 4 or 5am, with keertan (musical recitation of hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib) and katha (lectures on Sikhism). These celebrations go on until around 1 or 2 pm.After this, Karah Parsaad is served. This is halwa, a sweet-tasting food which has been blessed.

Brajbhoomi refers to the places connected to the legends of the birth and childhood of Krishna and his dalliance with Radha.As Holi continues to be a significant festival for the Brajvasis, many of the old ways of celebration survive. However, with time, the community feeling has lessened somewhat. Kamla Mathur takes us back to her childhood when Holi meant sheer fun.Holi is For Children [Illustrations by Shinod AP]When I was small, our Holi celebrations used to go on for 20 days. In Etah, Holi started on Basant panchami, the festival that announces the arrival of spring and almost everyone used to be dressed in yellow.In the morning, the idol of Lord Krishna would be taken out on a rath or chariot in a procession. All the while the attendant priests would sprinkle gulal (dry powdered colour) and gulab jal (rose water) on the onlookers. Do you know this procession used to be taken out at 7 a.m. especially so that we children would not miss out on it – we had to go to school after that.The next few days would be spent visiting friends. A dash of gulal or chandan (sandalwood) powder on the forehead was the usual practice. The wild celebration was reserved for badi (big) Holi. My mother used to make gulal at home by grinding dried flowers. So, for those few days the whole house smelt of flowers and chandan.Four days before Holi, came the day of rang pashi. It was spent in making food, decorating the house and dressing up. A traditional meal would comprise kadhi (a dish made of curd and ground Bengal gram) and rice, roti and a vegetable. This was offered as bhog or offering to Lord Krishna first thing in the morning.Then the women would get busy making rangoli (floor patterns) and cleaning the house for guests in the evening. We children would patter around – helping a bit, spoiling a bit more! I used to help my mother make kanji or a cool drink with vada or a fried ball of fermented lentil and gujiyas, a sweetmeat. This would be for the evening.Rang Pashi was a very important day for us and for a new daughter-in-law in the family. In the evening, the women would dress up in their dandiya – a white saree with specially dyed pink borders and bedeck themselves in jewellery.A white sheet would be spread out in the living room for the family members and relatives to sit in a circle with a plateful of gulal and coloured water made from the tesu flower, in the centre. Then, starting from the eldest, everyone would put some colour on each other and tuck into the food!You know, something very exciting would happen that day. The new daughter-in-law was supposed to watch for an opportunity to lock up all the elders of the house into a room. And then she could ask for anything from anyone – jewellery, new clothes, anything! The in-laws, uncles and aunts could not refuse her. After all, she would not let them out till they agreed to give what she demanded! We used to have a lot of fun on this day.The eve before Holi is puranmachi or full moon day. On that day, Holi is burned at a time decided by the priest. The fire signifies the triumph of good over evil. We would all walk around the fire once and make plans for the next day.On Holi day, there are no constraints. You can put as much colour on anyone and drench anyone repeatedly. We used to make bucketfuls of tesu water and gulal at home.Traditionally, only a few colours of gulal were made. Red colour with rose flowers, orange colour with harshringhar flowers, light yellow colour with tesu flowers and white colour with chameli flowers. Sometimes, rarely though, my mother would add a pinch of finely ground silver to the colours to add a touch of glitter in them.By noon on Holi we would be completely exhausted. And all we would think about was lunch and sleep.All these celebrations and get-togethers used to be a build-up to the final day – each occasion made us aware of the changing seasons, the landscape, the cropping patterns and the changing feelings in our hearts as winter changed to spring.Nowadays the celebrations are quite toned down and people are increasingly letting go of customs. I think this dilutes the fun in a festival, especially for children.

Though a Hindu festival, it is played by Indians from all communities – especially in the metropolitan cities of India, where people from all over the country have come and settled. On the day of Holi, it is as if the clock stops running, for it is a national holiday. Even for the newspapers.The festivities start early in the morning. People who prefer a gentler Holi greet each other by applying gulal or dry colours on each other. The adventurous ones splash coloured water, water balloons or simply turn the water pipes on!! Those who want to make others squirm use pukka or fast colours mixed in water – or even paint. But it is a fact that this festival is enjoyed the most if there is a large gathering echoing with laughter, gentle pranks and jokes.You name the color and it is there. The more multicolored or horrible you are to look at, the better you feel. If only the eyes and teeth are visible, it is ideal. Water balloons are the biggest source of excitement for children, who can aim them at anyone. On the day of Holi there are few restrictions. For once, parents too don’t pester them by telling them not to throw balloons; many of them also join the fun.The good thing about going from house to house and greeting neighbours and friends is that you get to eat special flour-based sweets like gujiya and malpua, and savouries like mattri. It does not matter that you don’t really know the person in whose house you are wolfing down so many things.Come lunch time and it is time to turn homewards and hope that the authorities have supplied extra water so that one can take off all the colours. Still, Holi does leave its imprint on many a face for days to come.This is the kind of Holi that most children and adults like to play. But there are many people who use the lack of restrictions and turn a friendly fight into a violent one. There are those who start aiming coloured balloons at people even a week before Holi, which leads to fights. The newspapers that come out two days after Holi, always have some violence or the other to report.But then, the majority of children and adults do celebrate this festival in the way it is meant to be.

At sundown, after a whole day of not eating or even taking a sip of water, the fast is broken. It is the time when the family gets together and eats a light but energy-giving healthy meal. This is Iftar, or the meal that breaks the fast.But ask anyone about the famed Iftar parties and the response: “Oh Iftar! Hi-fi parties. That’s one place where politics and authentic mughlai food mingle…”So, how many of us know what the term Iftar party really signifies? What is this new meaning of that word? Are Iftar parties as we know them a new phenomenon or have they been part of the Ramzan ethos always? Recently, I discovered something interesting that I wanted to share with you.To start with, the meaning of Eid-ul-Fitr has to be clarified. This one month of fast is a period meant to be devoted to self-purification, helping the poor and concentrate on God. It is not a time to enjoy or feast. Unfortunately, this is what Iftar parties have come to signify.Also, little to no non-vegetarian food is consumed during this period. The traditional food includes energy-giving dates, sweetmeats and seviyan (vermicelli pudding). The scientific reason behind this is that after a whole day of fasting, a light and healthy meal is recommended. However, Iftar parties now connote a time feasting with “mouth-watering kababs, good mughlai food and palao gosht.” The dates and seviyan are sidelined into insignificance.Difficult to believe though it is, at an Iftar party organized by the Speaker to the Lok Sabha (House of Commons) G M C Balayogi recently, several people were shocked when music was played!People waiting for Iftar near the Eyup Sultan Mosque at Ramadan. Prometheus72 / Shutterstock.comOver time, the Iftar too has changed in character. Just like corporates and businesses take the opportunity to cash in on Diwali and Christmas sentiments by sending sweets and cakes to build their company image and get favours, similarly the feelings behind Iftar are exploited. Politicians have started throwing Iftar parties for politically influential Muslims in order to woo the Muslims and get their votes.So how did the concept of Iftar get so badly distorted?It was Jawaharlal Nehru, former Prime Minister, who started holding Iftar parties for ambassadors from Arabic countries. His daughter, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, continued this tradition. Apart from inviting Arab ambassadors, she also called elite members of the Muslim League, a political organisation.However, it was only after the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992 that Iftar parties became ostentatious affairs. Almost every minister started holding the party, trying to outdo the other with even more non-vegetarian food. And now, by having music!! The press is invited to write about the parties. Who attended whose party is a prestige issue and sometimes political statements are made.While some really devout Muslims refuse to attend these types of parties, there are several who do.

These include asking yourself exactly what it is you want, and then making sure your question answers this. Another good question is “How else can I think about this?” Such a question can make you look at a situation from a different angle and give you new and better ideas and questions. There is also a question that gets you to look at a situation from the viewpoint of others: “What is the other person thinking, feeling, and wanting?” This may give you successful questions in a business deal. A follow-up question could be “How can I turn this into a win-win situation?” The final question on their list is: “What is possible?” This is a great question to ask.

The day started in 1992 as a way to increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed.  Some of the events held on this day include right-handers being asked to use left-handed objects so they can see how awkward it can be doing things the wrong way round. A simple example of this is the computer mouse. Imagine right and left clicking on a mouse that is a mirror image of the one you use. Other events include left-hand-only games.\n\nScientists have no answer to the question why some of us are left-handed. About fifteen per cent of the population are. Some people believe it is genetic. It does run in families. Research suggests that left-handers are likely to be more creative. There are higher percentages of left-handed people as musicians, artists and scientists. Indeed, left-handers say being left-handed is a sign of greater intelligence. There is also research to show that left-handers are also good at ball sports and things involving hand-to-eye co-ordination, like boxing. There are many interesting facts about left-handers. Most left-handers draw figures facing to the right and they usually see better underwater.

They are monks who follow the Jain religion. They cover their mouths and noses to avoid any involuntary killing – even of germs.Sometimes they also carry small brooms to remove any small creature out of their way so that they do not unknowingly tread on it. Their lifelong attempt is to live by the principle of ahimsa or non violence. So it is with Jains who lead lives like you, me and others.Mahavir Jayanti [Illustration by Shinod AP]Jainism, a religion that originated in India in 6-5 century BC (about 2600 years ago), was founded by Mahavira. His birth anniversary, celebrated as Mahavir Jayanti every year, is the main festival of the Jains.The 24th and last in a line of preachers called Tirthankaras, Mahavira the teacher, as he was called, gave a concrete shape to ideas that had been voiced by the earlier saints. These ideas were a rebellion against the existing practices made popular by the priestly class of Hindus.It was one of the most interesting times in the history of the land we call India, specifically the Gangetic valley in present-day Bihar. Jainism was founded at a time of great social and economic upheaval in India.It was a period of transition, when an agrarian society was transforming itself into an urban-based one. This happened due to the rapid growth of trade and commerce in India which in turn led to the growth of towns and the expansion of a professional class of artisans and traders.The aspirations of these groups expressed themselves in new unorthodox ideas. They were voiced by people belonging to these groups. So, both Mahavira and Buddha belonged to the kshatriya class. Their ideas challenged the established Brahmanical aspects of Hindu religion and its endless rituals.Hindu caste hierarchy comprised of four groups: the brahmins or priestly class; the kshatriyas or warrior class; the vaishyas or trader class and the shudras or untouchables. The brahmins exploited the lower castes in the name of religion. They made expensive pujas (worship) complete with animal sacrifice a necessary part of Hinduism. This in turn kept many people out of its fold.Both Jainism and the more popular Buddhism, the most influential sects of the time, challenged these notions. That is why both preached equality. They offered the lower castes and the downtrodden hope and a place to belong. Both also condemn animal sacrifice strongly, the Jains going one step further and declaring even the inhaling of airborne germs while breathing, a sin.It is interesting to ask why these ideas became so popular at that time. The answer is simple: they made perfect sense at that time. The common people could not engage in the elaborate rituals that were an important part of Brahmanism at that time.Also, the rise in animal sacrifice was proving to be very expensive and was harmful to an agricultural society. Cattle was very important for clearing the land, ploughing the fields and milching. It was important that they not be killed in such large numbers.Jain statue, KhajurahoMost importantly, these ideas were expressed in Pali, a language/script that could be easily understood by large sections of the common people. Brahmanism relied on Sanskrit, the language of the few.Initially Jainism did not encourage idol worship, was against the caste system, especially untouchability, and preached equality. However, in times to come, as the religion grew and acquired more converts, it became complex. Different groups came up that began to interpret the teachings differently.Jainism never became as popular and widespread as Buddhism. This was because it was more strict about even common people maintaining its principals. Its adherents came mainly from the trading community. The religion which originated in the Gangetic valley, spread to parts of northern, western and southern India and continues to hold sway to this day.", "keyword": ["class", "jainism", "religion", "caste", "mahavira"]}, {"title": "Makar Sankranti", "article": "The colourful kite-flying festival of Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan, which falls on January 14 each year, marks the end of a long winter and the return of the sun to the northern hemisphere.

The day is also of special significance, because on this day, the day and night are of equal hours.Makar Sankranti [Illustrations by Kusum Chamoli]Celebrated since time immemorial, among Hindus all over India, the day finds a mention even in the epic Mahabharata. We are told that the warrior hero Bhishma Pitamah, even on being fatally wounded and lying on a bed of arrows, lingered on till Uttarayan set in, to breathe his last.It is believed that the person who dies on his auspicious day escapes the cycle of birth and rebirth and that the soul mingles with the almighty.Makar Sankranti heralds the arrival of spring, the season of fruitfulness and plenty. And nothing signifies this better than the soft seeds of til or sesame. Across India, housewives prepare sweetmeats made from til – whether it is a basic mixture of til and jaggery, or laddus, or the famous til-poli of Maharashtra. In the southern part of India, the day is celebrated as Pongal, where a fullsome meal of lentils and rice liberally dashed with ghee is offered to gods, and then to family members.In the northern states, like Punjab, the festival is celebrated as Lohri, where the end of a bitter winter is marked with the burning of huge bonfires liberally fed with handfuls of til sweets, rice and sugarcane. In Uttar Pradesh, the festival is called Khichedi and a typical rice and lentil preparation (called Khichdi), with the mandatory dash of ghee, is offered not just to the Gods, but is also distributed among the poor.Interestingly, this is a time of celebration for Muslims too. Just out of the month-long fasts of Ramzan, Muslims celebrate the festival of Id just a few days prior to Makar Sankranti. Prayers and hectic preparation of food and the famous seviyan, or vermicelli pudding cooked in milk mark the day which is a time to eat the best and wear the brightest. Its a time of plenty, and a time to give, especially to those who are needy.The most colourful celebration of Makar Sankranti can be seen in the western states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Colourful kites dot the skies as each one attempts to outdo the other. As the sun sets, children and adults desperate to extend the day, add floating oil lanterns to the tails of their kites – a sight that brings to life the true meaning of the day: a return to light, to warmth, to the life-giving sun.A famous Sanskrit Shloka that expresses it best reads:Asato maa sadgamaya Tamaso maa jyotirgamaya Mrityoormaa amritam gamayaLead me, O Lord, from untruth to Truth from darkness to Light and from death to Immortality.", "keyword": ["sankranti", "makar", "rice", "sun", "northern"]}, {"title": "Mardi Gras", "article": "\"Mardi Gras\" is French for “Fat Tuesday”.

But then there is the power-nap. This is a short sleep which ends just before we fall into deep sleep. It quickly refreshes you and stops you from feeling drowsy and groggy. Another variety is the caffeine nap. This is when you have a power nap after a cup of coffee. It takes about 20 minutes for the caffeine to take effect, so when you wake up you feel doubly energized.

In Japan, children throw a lower baby tooth up onto the roof so the next tooth grows healthily upwards; an upper tooth goes under the house so the new adult tooth grows downwards. Korea and Vietnam have similar customs. In parts of India, children wrap their milk teeth in cotton and offer it to the sun. In many parts of Europe, a fairy mouse takes away the teeth.

Other Muslim families give away at least 3.5 kg of food per family, as fitra (alms) to the poor.During the month of Ramdan, the day in a Muslim household begins early. Everyone is up and about by five in the morning, well in time for the sehri (the meal that must be eaten before day break). The early morning meal is a simple affair and is supposed to end about 40 minutes before daybreak. It’s the only meal to be had before nightfall.Mostly grown-ups and teenagers keep roza but children too can observe the fast. Not many children are able to observe rozas all the days of the month, but they do compete with each other to see who keeps the maximum number of fasts!The month-long fast ends with the sighting of the new moon when the actual celebrations of Eid ul-Fitr begin. Eid-ul-Fitr actually means the joy at the end of days of fasting.During the evenings, the menfolk gather at a masjid for a reading of the Koran and as the sun sinks out of sight, the muezzin (priest)‘s call signals the end of the day long fast. The roza is broken by consuming a few dates and sharbat (sweet juice) and it is time for the evening prayers.Once the prayers are over, Iftar (feast that breaks the fast) is next and the streets spring to life as vendors clamour to sell piping hot jalebis, sizzling kababs and skewered delicacies wreathed in steam and smoke.Islamic Holy PlaceWomen clad in burkhas, and men dressed in white kurta pajamas and colourful caps, can be spotted jostling through the crowds as groups of noisy children trail behind.

People wish each other, “Chand Mubarak” (‘Eid Mubarak!’ is wished only after the Eid namaaz the next morning).

Another legend says that people began exploding crackers to convey to the gods, their joy at being alive and well on earth.Rediscovering a Smoke-less Diwali [Illustration by Sudheer Nath]Now come back to the present when the uncontrolled celebration of the victory of good over evil itself seems to have become a source of pollution. For on the day after Diwali, the entire country looks like a planet devastated by a meteor.The smoke from crackers is one, if one doesn’t take into account the deafening sounds of the victory of good over evil. The smoke hangs, suspended in the morning air, accompanied by an acrid, pungent smell that makes it impossible to breathe.Millions of shreds of coloured paper that make up the body of the crackers, litter every nook and cranny. A reminder of the previous night’s revelries, they aren’t a pretty sight.But I’m not the only one turning up my nose at the noise and smoke. The number of people who are keen to fashion newer, friendlier ways of celebration and enjoyment, is on the rise.Children show the wayLast week, schoolchildren in Delhi took part in an environmental run organised by an NGO, Panchavati, and hosted by the Bluebells School, Delhi. Their aim was to tell shopkeepers: “We are no longer the buyers, you should no longer be the sellers.” They were referring to the buying and selling of firecrackers. And wonder of wonders, Delhi’s shopkeepers have reported a 25 per cent drop in cracker sales this year.Normally, it is the children who start “reminding” their parents (as if they are allowed to forget) long before Diwali, about the pressing need to stock up on crackers. But since last year, many parents in Delhi and other cities have been surprised out of their skins to hear their children say that they would not spend on crackers.For one, say the children, the crackers that they love are made by children their age or younger, in the factories of Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, in conditions that pose a grave danger to their health. Secondly, crackers have a polluting effect.The parents’ jaws have fallen collectively. For years they have been trying to talk about the hundreds or thousands of rupees that are blown up in seconds or about the injuries caused by firecracker accidents, but the children would not listen. This time, it is the children who are saying no to crackers, without being forced to doso.This change of heart and mind has been brought about in discussions and debates in schools, where teachers and children together have discovered some dark facts about the Festival of Lights.The government steps inThe government of Delhi, for instance, has carried on an effective campaign, ‘Say no to Crackers’. People have also been asked not to burst high-intensity crackers in the capital.High-intensity crackers increase noise-levels six to ten times more than the acceptable limits, often causing irreparable harm to the ear-drum.Group fun, great fun!More than 400 years ago, Mughal emperor Akbar started organising mammoth firework displays during Diwali. They called it aatishbazi or a grand show of fireworks. It is said that the fireworks display at Akbar’s capital Agra, could be seen from the Qutab Minar in Delhi as well.Maybe it is time for us to think of better ways to celebrate the victory of good over evil, by thinking of good ways to enjoy. For that governments need to think of stopping the exploitation of child workers by employers in fireworks factories instead of just banning high-intensity crackers. This is where the schoolchildren’s campaign last year proved to be so heartening.How about fewer and collective displays where people can pool resources for a grand show? Just think of it, even if ten families pool in just ten crackers each, they can have a glorious Diwali with a hundred crackers to light up the sky.Many residential areas do have community fireworks displays. They’re great fun to watch in an open park, very economical because each family only pays a very small amount as its share, and the pollution is less.And for the individual bit of celebration, let’s light up those lamps, hang the lovely kandeels or paper lanterns and pull out the rangoli colours.

The illness is listed as a mental condition that is linked to personality disorders and depression. The most common way of self-injury is cutting the skin in places the injurer can easily hide. Many self-injurers prefer to conceal their injuries. Other methods include skin picking, hair pulling, alcohol abuse and forms of anorexia and bulimia. Many self-injurers say they get physical pleasure from their behaviour. The body releases natural drugs, endorphins, in response to physical injury.

In Calcutta, specially, almost every neighbourhood has a Puja Committee to organise the Puja in their locality, every year.Come September and the Committee members begin to meet at each other’s houses and chalk out plans for grand celebrations over endless rounds of cha(tea) and adda (discussion).Anyone can qualify – all one needs is boundless enthusiasm. These people set up the pandal or the tents that house the festivities. They also organise the idol-making, decide on the cultural programmes — and the feast. It’s all for the cause of Ma Durga. Above all, it’s fun!The Business of Festivals [Illustration by Shiju George]What is interesting is that these Puja celebrations have become big business for their organisers. In Calcutta and every other city with a sizeable Bengali population, the Pujas are often sponsored by big business groups. Even the devi stands under the protection of their bold, fluttering banners.In Delhi’s largely-Bengali colony, Chittaranjan Park, there are several big Pujas organised by the local Bengali community with the generous sponsorship of sponsors.The area outside the biggest Puja resembles a fair during this time, which is why it is known as the Mela Ground. Food stalls, saree stalls and book stalls jostle for space with merry-go-rounds here. Thousands throng the pandals for a taste of the festive spirit.They do come to see the Durga idol, but they also come for the cultural programmes organised in the evenings. The local performers from the neighbourhood make way for the various artists who are invited to perform, mostly with the lure of handsome fees, in the evenings. From jatra troupes and Calcutta pop sensations, to semi-classical vocalists, the Mela ground has seen and heard them all.The Pujas have always been occasions for lavish spending. In the 19th century, in Calcutta, the Daws, Mitras and Debs were wealthy families of North Calcutta who organised splendid Pujas in their own houses. The Pujas were a family tradition.More than 150 years later, the tradition still continues for these families (except the Mitras ) and several other old families of Calcutta. Organising them year after year reaffirms the status of these families as the most prominent ones in the city. Moreover, it’s a way of reliving past glories through grand celebrations.Many of the oldest Pujas have historic associations. Take the Ghosh family Puja of Pathuriaghata Street, for example. The Puja, which is 230 years old, used to be visited by Warren Hastings, the first Governor General of Bengal. Pujas such as these still make an effort to maintain the dignity of the past.

And no brightly illuminated shops, their racks groaning under the weight of colourful packets of cakes, wine, dolls and every other gift item you could possibly think of? Impossible? Like imagining Diwali without the fireworks?But isn’t it strange how festivals like Christmas and Diwali are virtually unimaginable without the accompanying glitz that goes with them? Take away the show, the giving and receiving of gifts and people’s enthusiasm about the festivals might evaporate in no time.The Commerce of Christmas [Illustrations by Shiju George and Shinod A.P.]Take Christmas. How did a festival that started out to celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ – a humble carpenter’s son who rose to become one of the most charismatic and compassionate saints that the world has ever seen – lose its spirit so profoundly? And become the most commercialised of all religious festivals?Stephen Nissenbaum believes he has the explanation. Nissenbaum, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, and author of a new book called, The Battle for Christmas, writes: “There never was a time when Christmas existed as an unsullied domestic idyll, immune to the taint of commercialism”. What he means is, from the beginning, Christmas – American style – has been ‘commercial at its very core’. And it’s well known that what America does, the rest of the world adopts blindly soon after.There was no Christmas in America in the beginning. As late as the first decades of the 19th century, Nissenbaum observes, “Christmas was neither a domestic holiday nor a commercial one”. The Puritans of New England suppressed it, even for a time forbidding it by law. The Puritans were one of several groups of white settlers in America, who followed a rigid spartan form of Protestant Christianity.For one thing, they argued, the New Testament gives no date – or season – for the birth of Christ. The New Testament is the later, and smaller of the two major divisions of the Christian Bible, and the portion that is canonical (authoritative) only to Christianity. The other reason is that they identified Christmas with the pagan rites of ancient Rome (rites practised by followers of a polytheistic religion – that is, a religion of many gods). But puritan rule did not last long.The commerce of ChristmasSoon Christmas was more like carnival time, when rowdies spilled into the streets with public displays of eating and drunkenness. ‘Wassailing’ was one very disruptive custom. Packs of poorer youth and workers would lay siege to the homes of the well off, demanding free drink and food.By the end of the 19th century Christmas celebrations began to be taken seriously. The day of Christmas, 25th December, became a public holiday. In cities like New York and Philadelphia, the ‘misrule’ of Christmas mobs had become so widespread that it threatened civic life. The wealthy hired guards to protect their property. Shopkeepers barred their doors; pedestrians stayed home.But Protestant America did not have the sanctioned religious festivals of Catholic Europe. Americans needed a tradition for celebrating Christmas. So they went ahead and invented one. With a little help from the myth of Santa Claus.In his poem of 1822, A Visit from St. Nicholas, Clement Clarke Moore, a very wealthy New Yorker, gave Americans a benign non-threatening night visitor whom all classes would welcome. St. Nick played the role of a wealthy benefactor distributing gifts to the dependent class. But instead of the working poor as a whole, his gifts were meant for children.Within five years of its publication, Moore’s poem became wholly associated with Christmas. Newspaper editorials began to speak of Christmas as ‘a festival sacred to domestic enjoyments’. Although public drinking and merrymaking continued the ‘real Christmas’, was gradually identified with rituals that centred on children and took place in the quiet of homes.The old Yule spirit of ‘letting go’ in December was transformed: what were loosened were the purse strings of the parents. If Christmas was a time for giving gifts, they had to be purchased. A logic completely in keeping with the capitalist ethos of America, in which sale of goods took precedence over everything else.By the middle of the 19th century, Santa Claus was a common figure in stories and advertisements. Santa Claus legitimised the expecting of gifts by children, no matter how difficult it might be for parents to procure them. The commercialisation of Christmas was thus complete.A recent Hollywood film, Jingle all the Way, shows all that a hapless father has to undergo, in order to get the sought-after toy that his son wanted. The father in the film is a well-paid professional; he is willing to spend any amount to get his hands on the toy. But what about a father who cannot afford a toy like that? His inability to buy the toy could be taken to mean he loves his child a little less, couldn’t it?Today Christmas, especially in the western countries, places an additional social pressure on people to buy and give gifts, to buy extra things for Christmas dinner and other celebrations. Gifts that they don’t really need and often cannot afford.Christmas is a money-raking season for merchants and corporates. All the signs associated with Christmas, the tinsel, Christmas trees, the decorations in shops and malls, and the gifts hidden in mistletoes, are meant to send out one prominent message – spend, spend like there’s no tomorrow.The really distressing thing is the way people across the world have eagerly responded to the message. The real Christmas message of love and brotherhood seem to have got lost on the way somewhere.", "keyword": ["christmas", "gift", "toy", "nissenbaum", "domestic"]}, {"title": "The Making of the Goddess", "article": "On an ordinary day, the names Kumartuli and Krishnanagar would not make much of a difference to a Bengali. But come Durga Puja, and these two ordinary towns near Calcutta, become the focus of great attention. For it is here that the clay idols of Durga are made. This age-old tradition of clay sculpture has been preserved by the community of Pals.Months before the Puja, clay artisans start to breathe life into the images of Durga.The Making of the Goddess []Body of bamboo, straw and clayThe basic structure of the huge platform is made with bamboo, as is the Durga idol’s skeleton. The flesh over the bones is made of straw tied with the help of jute strings. The palms, head and feet are made separately.As soon as one set of craftspersons finish making the straw body, the artisans specialising in clay work apply several layers of clay over the body, to give it a smooth look. It is at this point that the palms, head and feet are attached to the main torso.On being completed, the figure is given a skin colour of white. Then the whole statue is painted with earth colours like yellow and red. The head, palms and feet are made by the highest graded artisans or Pals.Making the head is a delicate processThe making of the head is a delicate process. The Pals make it with good-quality clay, giving delicate touches to the features. When completed, the head is dried. The liquid plaster of Paris is poured over it. This creates a mould.When the plaster dries, it is separated from the clay head. The plaster mould is now hollow and many more heads can be made by pouring clay into it.Finally the eyes are painted by the main artist. Then jute ‘hair’ is glued on, the idol is varnished and dressed up with fine clothes and ornaments.Preparing for the goddess’ visitCelebrations for the festival span a period of ten days. Since it is essentially a community affair, almost every colony or locality in Bengal erects tents for the grand Puja. So do Bengalis living outside the state. Artisans create beautiful tents or pandals, and there is rigorous competition to see who puts up the most lavish pandal.On the first day of the festival, hymns are recited to invoke the goddess in the heavens. This special recital is known as Mahalaya. The next five days are spent preparing for the grand yearly visit of ‘ma’, or mother as Durga is affectionately called in Bengal.Sixth day: breathing life into the idolOn the sixth day, called Mahashashti, the idol of the goddess is placed on a raised platform in the pandal. This is the day when the goddess is believed to arrive, accompanied by her children Ganesha and Kartikeya, as well as Lakshmi and Saraswati.It is then the turn of the priest to “put life” into the idol. This is done by a priest’s ceremony. For the next four days, the idol is treated as the goddess herself.In the entire making of the idol, it is possible to see the hierarchy of the Indian caste system in play. Craftsmen from lower castes make the skeleton, with the higher castes making the more delicate features, and the brahmin priest imparting “life” to the idol.", "keyword": ["clay", "idol", "head", "goddess", "delicate"]}, {"title": "The Nine Nights of Navaratri", "article": "This year, the end of September marks the onset of Navaratri or “nine nights” in the Hindu calendar. With this begins one of the most festive phases in India, with Durga Puja in east India, Dussehra in north, central and west India, and Saraswati Puja in South India. It also sets the stage for Diwali in the near future.Navaratri literally means ‘nine nights’. This nine-day period, sacred to Durga, is celebrated sometime in the months of October and November. It is considered the most auspicious time of the Hindu calendar.The Nine Nights of Navaratri [Illustration by Shiju George]Although it has different names in different parts of India, the festival celebrations centre on the conquest of good over evil. Every region has its own myths and reasons to explain this.Nine aspects of DeviThe nine different aspects of Devi are worshipped over the nine days, says a report on indiancultureonline.com. As Durga, she is the goddess beyond reach; as Bhadrakali she is the power of time; as Amba or Jagdamba, she is mother of the world; as Annapurna, she is giver of food and plenty; as Sarvamangala, she is the auspicious goddess; as Bhairavi she represents the fearful power of death; as Chandika or Chandi she is violent, wrathful, furious; as Lalita she is playful; and as Bhavani, giver of existence.The festivities culminate on the tenth day, called variously as Vijayadashmi, Dussehra or Dassain when people in most parts of India burn effigies of Ravana, his son Meghanatha and brother Kumbhakarna.The legendIt is believed that in ancient times, this was a festival intended for the Kshatriyas or warrior-class of India. After the four-month long monsoon when military activity was not possible, this was considered a good time to start afresh on one’s conquests. For nine days before starting on the war journey, kings prayed to the nine different aspects of Devi or Adishakti. They also prayed for their arms and ammunition. The tenth day was when the journey for the conquest began.The origin of this custom can also be traced to the Ramayana. According to it, Rama had to pray to the nine different aspects of Devi to be able to kill Ravana. He then accumulated enough power to kill Ravana on the tenth day, which was called Vijayadashmi or day of victory.Since then, the tradition of praying to the Devi for nine days has continued. The Kshatriyas believed that by doing so, they too would be able to defeat their most powerful enemy.On the eighth day, an animal is sacrificed by many communities, specially Gurkhas and other hill tribes who are believers in the Devi cult. This blood sacrifice is a way of thanking the goddess for a wish that has been granted. People often sacrifice a buffalo symbolic of the killing of Mahishasura by Durga.The practiceSome people fast on all nine days, eating only fruit and milk dishes. Some fast only on the eighth or ninth day. As the festival is dear to the mother goddess, on the eighth or ninth day many people invite over nine young girls from the neighbourhood. These girls are treated as the goddess herself. People ceremonially wash their feet, worship them and then offer food to the “girl-goddesses.On the first day of Navaratri, grains of barley are planted in the puja room of the house after a small puja. Every day some water is sprinkled on it. On the tenth day, the shoots are about 3 -5 inches in length. After the puja, these seedlings are pulled out and given to devotees as a blessing from god.The devout place the seedlings on their caps, behind their ears, and inside books to bring good luck. This custom suggests that the festival’s link to harvesting is quite pronounced. For soon after this festival, the sugarcane crop is harvested and the winter crops sown.The celebrationsIt is an occasion for vibrant festivities throughout the country. In Bengal and Orissa, during Navaratri, devotees of Durga fast and pray for health and prosperity. Different manifestations of Durga or Shakti are worshipped every night.In the Western part of the country, in Gujarat and Maharashtra, devotees and young people dance the Garba and Dandiya-Raas all through the night. While garba is slow, dandiya is an exuberant dance. Both dances have dancers striking their sticks in a rhythmic movement.The Navaratri festival celebrations in Ahmedabad and Baroda in Gujarat are famous throughout India. Here, the evenings and nights are occasions for the fascinating Garba dance. The women dance around an earthen lamp while singing devotional songs accompanied by rhythmic clapping of the hands.In Punjab, Navaratri is a period of fasting. In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, a special platform is constructed in homes on which are placed icons, toys and other colourful objects. Friends and relatives are invited for the Bommai Kolu, as the arrangement is called.On the ninth day, people in southern India celebrate Saraswati Puja. All objects of learning like books, stationary, musical instruments and other objects associated with them are placed on a pedestal and worshipped.

Friend, dance to the beat as Nandlal is playing hori’ – so the song goes.)The Song of Hori or Happiness [Mughal miniature print, courtesy National Museum, New Delhi]Holi – the word was originally hori or happiness in Brajbhasha, a dialect of Hindi language. In fact, in Braj, people still call Holi, Hori. The verse above happens to be the hori, as the song of Holi is called.So how and when did Hori change to Holi? And why did the people call it Hori in the first place?There are many myths surrounding this question and many of them link the festival to Krishna, right from the day this son of Devaki and Vasudev was brought to Gokul as an infant and placed in the care of foster parents. Born in a prison in Mathura during the night, he was taken away by his father to escape the wrath of his uncle, King Kans.Time passed. The people of Gokul had just harvested a good wheat and gram crop – the first of the season. Winter was on its way out, the spring flowers were budding and it was a full moon day. Also, it was the month of chait or the first month of the Hindu year. Since everything around them gave the message of new life and the Nand household had an heir after a long time, the people of Gokul decided to celebrate.So wheat and gram were roasted, flowers of different colours were powdered and the women prepared sweetmeats. There was great singing and dancing to the beats of the dholak (the two-sided drum).This became an annual ritual following the harvest and Hori became a festival. Old timers recount that in Uttar Pradesh, there used to be only two harvests – one in March and the other around July.With time, more and more myths got attached to Holi. It came to symbolise the triumph of good over evil when King Hiranyakashyap decided to burn his son, Prahlad, alive. The king made Prahlad sit on his aunt’s lap in a pyre. His aunt, Holika, had been granted the boon of not burning in fire. However, Holika died, while Prahlad lived, unhurt.Ever since then, the custom of burning Holika began. And Hori got another name – Holi. However, the hori song remained. It still speaks of the boy Krishna, though over a period of time the hori has acquired new shades – from folk to classical and semi-classical styles.", "keyword": ["hori", "holi", "khelat", "gokul", "song"]}, {"title": "The Story of Diwali", "article": "Deepavali or Diwali as it has come to be known as, means many things to many people. It means holidays from school, shopping expeditions for clothes, sweets, gifts and crackers to children. To the office-goer it means an annual bonus that can make all this happen.To the businessman Diwali means brisk business just as to the clay potter, Diwali is the occasion of the year when the bulk of his sales are made. Diwali has a special significance for the trading communities of India who usher in their new year and new accounting books (‘bahi khata’) during this time.The Story of Diwali [Illustrations by Sudheer Nath and Shiju George]Clearly, Diwali is the most exuberant of all Indian festivals. It is the equivalent of Christmas in the West, and people of each age have added their meanings to the celebration of Diwali.How did Diwali begin?The origins of Diwali lie in ancient India as a festival probably celebrated after an important harvest. It was a good time for the cultivators or vaishyas to celebrate. The granaries were full at the end of a long monsoon, and winter was still to come. They paid off their debts, celebrated and started afresh.Gradually, the vaishyas became landowners and traders and Diwali became a time for them to change their annual accounting books. Their new year started with Diwali.This is the reason why Diwali is also the festival of Goddess Lakshmi, who personifies prosperity and wealth. Lakshmi pujas are held in most Hindu homes, especially in the north.Diwali myths: the end of Rama’s exileOver time, various mythological explanations were given for the celebration of Diwali.The most popular myth among these is the one linked to the ancient prince Rama, his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, returning to their kingdom, Ayodhya, after a 14-year exile, and the defeat of the king of Lanka, Ravana. To celebrate this event, people at Ayodhya are believed to have lit up their houses with lamps.The legend of Dhanavantari: physician of godsAccording to mythology he was the physician of the gods who is believed to have emerged with a pot of ‘amrit’ (nectar) during the ‘samudra manthan’ or the churning of the ocean, when the gods and the demons fought with each other. It is also believed that Lakshmi emerged from the churning of the ocean and, therefore, her worship forms a big part of the Diwali celebrations.South India: the myth of NarasimhaIn South India, the story linked to Diwali is that of Narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu, who is known as the God of Preservation among the Hindu Trinity that is made up of Brahma (the God of Creation) and Shiva (the God of Destruction).According to legend, Vishnu incarnates himself as Narasimha (man-lion) to rid the earth of an evil king Hiranyakshipu. The king had received a boon from Brahma that he could not be conquered by either god or human for the simple reason that he could be killed neither by beast nor man, neither inside nor outside, neither during the day nor at night.When Hiranyakshipu’s atrocities became unbearable, the gods turned to Vishnu for help. Vishnu reincarnated himself as Narasimha, half man and half lion and, therefore, neither man nor beast.As Narasimha, he killed Hiranyakshipu with his claws at the threshold (which is neither inside nor outside), and just before daybreak (a time when it is neither day nor night). That way he managed to get around the boon given to the king.", "keyword": ["diwali", "narasimha", "god", "vishnu", "hiranyakshipu"]}, {"title": "The Story of Dussehra", "article": "Dussehra, also called Vijayadashmi (or Bijoya in Bengal), is the culmination of the nine-day Navaratri celebrations. It is a festival that marks the killing of Ravana, his son Meghanatha and brother Kumbhakarna, by Rama. It is seen as the vistory of good over evilThe RamayanaThe epic Ramayana, describes the story of Rama. Rama was the exiled prince of the kingdom of Ayodhya. While in exile, he lived in the forest with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana. One day Sita was abducted by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka. Rama, assisted by an army of monkeys and Lakshmana, attacked Lanka to rescue her.Ms Sarah Welch / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)A fierce battle ensued between the two armies for many days. Rama found it very difficult to beat the mighty Ravana. So he prayed for nine days to nine different aspects of goddess Durga and accumulated enough strength to defeat Ravana.Dussehra celebrates Rama’s victory over Ravana in a festival spread out over ten days. The story of Rama’s life is enacted in a folk art form called Ramlila. Every nook and corner has its own Ramlila, with millions of actors enacting it during Dussehra. Conventionally, only men participated in the Ramlila, but now women, too, have started acting in them.The 10th day is one of fireworks. The final act of this drama is staged. Huge paper effigies stuffed with firecrackers, sometimes almost 100 feet high, of Ravana, his son and brother, are set ablaze. At the appointed hour, a person dressed as Rama, shoots flaming arrows at the effigies, which start to burn.The Dussehra of KuluAlthough Dussehra is celebrated across India, in some parts the celebrations are especially interesting. Kulu, a small town in Himachal Pradesh, is witness to unique Dussehra celebrations. Since the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who ruled Punjab (which also consisted of parts of Himachal Pradesh), more than 150 years ago, Dussehra celebrations here begin three days after they do in the rest of India.This is so because the powerful Maharaja expected all kings who paid him homage, to be present at Kulu for the celebration. These rulers would leave immediately after the celebrations in their kingdoms had ended, and head to Kulu. Since it took them three days to reach, this practice was established and has continued ever since.The lives of the hills people are full of fascinating myths that connect the existence of their very human gods to the natural surroundings — beautiful and harsh alternately. At times like Dussehra, then, if the humans celebrate, wouldn’t the gods rejoice too and have their annual reunion?Village deities from all around are brought to Kulu in palanquins. The procession is led by musicians and dancers. A large fair is also organised on this occasion.This is a good opportunity for people to buy and stock their provisions for the harsh winter ahead, as most places become inaccessible due to snow within a month of the festival.The Story of Dussehra []The Grand Dussehra of MysoreIn Mysore in the southern state of Karnataka, the celebrations take a unique turn. Instead of effigies of Ravana being burnt, five animals -a rooster, a fish, a lamb, a crab, and a buffalo – are sacrificed instead.Dussehra is a royal celebration in Mysore. The people of Mysore celebrate Durga Puja, too. They mark Durga’s killing of Mahishasura, who according to myth lived in those parts. The celebrations are held at the Durga temple atop the Chamundi hill, with a breathtaking view. Durga happens to be the family deity of the royal family.A regal procession of decorated elephants, courtiers and court symbols winds its way to the temple, which is decorated splendidly for the festival. On reaching the temple, prayers are offered to the goddess.This event attracts many tourists from India and abroad. But given the expenses involved, it has been a royal affair. Lately though, with the decline in the status of the royal family of Mysore, this festival has lost some of its traditional lustre.The ‘Bommai Kolu’ of Tamil NaduIn Tamil Nadu, Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, Saraswati, the goddess of learning and arts and Shakti (Durga) are worshipped. Here, and in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, families arrange dolls (Bommai Kolu) on specially built steps. They also prepare an elaborate spread of lamps and flowers.The day of Saraswati puja is a day of special happiness for anyone who has to study for school, college or any exam. On that day, the books are placed before the goddess of learning, with the fervent hope that the owner of the books does well.

Nearly all cultures celebrate this festival. For instance south Indians celebrate it as Pongal in the month of January, while the north Indians celebrate it as Holi in the month of March.The American act of thanksgiving began during the early pioneer days almost four hundred years ago.In 1620, one hundred people sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to land at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in America. However, their first winter was severe and their crops failed in the new climate and unfamiliar soil. Half of them died due to lack of fresh food.The few who survived were saved as Native Americans of the Iroquois tribe taught them how to grow corn (maize) and other crops, all of which were new food for the settlers.An artist’s impression of native indian thanksgivingIn the next autumn (fall season), 1621, bountiful crops of corn, barley, beans and pumpkins were harvested. The settlers had much to be thankful for, so a feast was planned. They invited the Iroquois chief and his tribe for this feast. The Indians brought turkeys and other wild game for the settlers. And the feast consisted of cranberries, corn turkey and deer, along with dishes taught by the Indians.Each year, the settlers decided to celebrate the autumn harvest with a feast of thanks. In 1776, after the U.S. became independent, the government recommended that a thanksgiving day be held to celebrate the occasion.President George Washington suggested November 26 as Thanksgiving Day. In 1863, the date was shifted by President Abraham Lincoln to the last Thursday in November as a day of thanksgiving. The date was again shifted in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the fourth Thursday of November to lengthen the shopping period before Christmas.However, Thanksgiving falls on a different date each year and the President must proclaim that date as the official celebration.A modern thanksgiving feast includes turkey, pumpkin, cranberries, acorns and more&mldr;The thanksgiving feast apart from showing gratitude for a good harvest is in fact a feast planned to thank the Native Americans for teaching the settlers how to grow and cook food.However, by the eighteenth century, the festival lost its initial relevance as these very settlers instead of showing gratitude aplenty to the Native Americans, systematically killed the buffalo and nearly drove it into extinction; and through deceit took over the land, and treacherously decimated the Native American tribes.Without the Native Americans the early settlers would not have survived and the United States, as it is today would not have existed !Today, thanksgiving is a festival of family reunion.

Here Holi is a robust enactment of the legends of Radha and Krishna.Then there is the Holi of Banaras. The way it is celebrated is the talk of the town and the famous kavi sammelan or poets’ gathering at Banaras is one reason for this. But that happens only in the evening when everyone has finished drenching each other in coloured water and gorged on chips and sweetmeats like gujiya and malpua.Where Holi is the Talk of the Town [Illustration by Anup Singh]It’s a typical Holi day in Village Nuav in Banaras.

And mothers are no less than heroes, considering the amount of effort they put into making their children’s lives a bit more easy and happier. Perhaps some of us may remember this the rest of the year as well.Why Mother’s Day? []The idea of Mother’s Day has existed in some form or the other for a long time. Ancient Greeks used to celebrate the beginning of spring by honouring Rhea, the mother of the Gods.Four hundred years ago, the English celebrated a festival called “Mothering Sunday” just before Easter, one of the most important festivals for Christians. On this day, women who worked as servants in the houses of the rich, were given a holiday. They could return to their homes and spend the day with their mothers. In other words, on that day, they were mothered. A special cake, called the Mothering Cake was also made on that day.But, what we know as Mother’s Day today, began less than a 100 years ago. It was started by Ann Jarvis, who lived in Philadelphia in the United States.When her mother, Ann Marie Reeves Jarvis, died in 1905, Ann wanted to do something for her. She decided to create a special day to keep the memory of her mother alive. On her mother’s second death anniversary, she asked her mother’s church in Grafton in West Virginia, to celebrate Mother’s Day. It was the second Sunday in May. Many people came for the celebration.Then, Jarvis asked the American government to declare the second Sunday in May a holiday to honour mothers. Her wish was granted. And, in 1910, West Virginia became the first state to mark Mother’s Day. A year later, nearly every state in the US had a Mother’s Day holiday. And in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson officially proclaimed Mother’s Day as a national holiday to be observed on the second Sunday of May.This is where the story becomes interesting. Thirteen years later, in 1923, Jarvis filed a case to stop the Mother’s Day festival. She felt that the feeling with which she had started the festival, had gone. Now companies were more interested in using Mother’s Day to make profits.When Jarvis died at the age of 84 in 1948, she was very unhappy. Never a mother herself, she had spent the entire fortune her mother had left her in trying to stop the festival she had founded. And, just before her death, she told a reporter that she was sorry she had ever started Mother’s Day. She did not succeed in bringing a stop to the festival she had started.Today, Mother’s Day is celebrated in various countries across the world. Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia and Belgium also celebrate Mother’s Day on the same day as the United States, on the second Sunday in the month of May. And, now even Indians are celebrating Mother’s Day on the same day.So, if you want to make a card for your mother on Mother’s Day, why don’t you learn how to make some interesting ones from our activities section.", "keyword": ["mother", "jarvis", "honour", "sunday", "festival"]}, {"title": "Why is Halloween Celebrated?", "article": "“Trick or Treat!” shout little witches, paper-bagged goblins, rubber-masked imps and bed-sheeted ghosts as they extend a bag across for candy. It is October and it’s Halloween time!Halloween is celebrated on the evening of October 31st, which is the evening before the Christian feast of All Saint’s Day. Halloween’s history goes back to the ancient religion of the Celtic tribes (circa 500 B.C.) from whom came the Britons, Scots and the Irish. Present day Britains, Scots, Welsh and Irish are all descendants from these ancient Celtic tribes.The Celts worshipped nature and believed in the spirit world. They worshipped over 300 gods. Their chief god was the sun and they celebrated two festivals revolving around the sun: Beltane, to mark the beginning of summer and Samhain or Saman to mark the start of winter.Why is Halloween Celebrated?The Celts believed that at the end of summer, Samhain, the lord of death becomes powerful and overpowers the sun god. On October 31, Samhain assembles all the evil spirits who had died the previous year and allows them to return home to visit the living.On October 31, after the harvest, the druids would meet under an oak grove or near large stone circles where they performed sacrifices. Some believe that the Stonehenge in England is one such druid circle. The priests would light great fires and offer sacrifices to Samhain to ensure that the sun returned after the winter.During the night all fires except the sacrificial one to Samhain were extinguished. The Vigil of Samhain, as it was called, would keep the sacrificial fire on through the night and the next day embers from this fire would be used to light the fire in each household.Villagers would try to appease goblins and demons with offerings of food and nuts. They would leave little treats that the household had to offer, to satisfy the hunger of these demons. If the demon was satisfied with the treat, it was believed it would not trick the person or cast an evil spell. Therein lies the origin of the present day trick or treat.Why is Halloween Celebrated?Legend has it that people would also wear masks or other disguises and blacken their faces to try and pass unnoticed by the spirits. This stemmed from the belief that ghosts or spirits cannot see their own reflection. Hence, if a goblin or demon saw another creature looking suitably horrible, they would run away in terror.After the Romans conquered Britian in 61 A.D., they brought with them their own harvest festival held on November 1, to honor Pomona, goddess of the fruits of trees. Over the years, the two festivals got mixed up and became one long holiday.In 834 A.D., Pope Gregory III shifted the festival of All Saints Day, then celebrated on May 13 to November 1. The new day was called All Saints Day or Hallowmas. Thus, the evening and night before it became All Hallow’s eve and later Halloween.The Celtic concept of ghosts and witches became blended with Roman and later Christian customs. In Ireland and Britain, Halloween was also celebrated as Mischief Night when villagers were allowed to play pranks on each other.Traces of the Roman Pomona festival such as ducking for apples in a tub of water still survive. Another is the use of hollowed-out pumpkins lit by candles in the belief that it would ward off evil spirits.Why is Halloween Celebrated?Today, Halloween is a festival of fun for kids. An occasion to dress up as little monsters, ghosts or witches. Over time the custom of adults dressing up as demons changed and the children took over. As they went from house to house they would knock at each house and cry “trick or treat”. People would then give the children apples or buns and later candy to keep from being tricked.However, since the 1960s, various crimes have been committed during Halloween. There have been cases of candy laced with drugs.Other incidents such as older children attacking younger children to steal their candy, or children finding razor blades or pieces of glass in their treats have also been reported.

They decide that from Work Your Proper Hours Day, they will completely stop doing unpaid overtime and start using the time for themselves. The TUC website has a quiz so you can decide if you are working too many extra hours for no pay. It asks you if everyone you work with is also doing extra hours and whether you seem to get busier and busier every year. It also asks if you are worried that if you go home on time, your boss will think you’re slacking.\n\nThe TUC says nearly five million people in Britain do unpaid overtime on a regular basis. If they got paid for this, the average employee would earn an extra £4,955 (around $10,000) a year. Working too long each day is bad for us. It causes stress, messes up our social life and relationships, and can have negative effects on family life. It is also bad for business if staff are worn out. There are signs that campaigns against overworking are beginning to make a difference. Within the past five years, fewer people are doing unpaid overtime and the average amount of time has gone down by 24 minutes a week.

Most people are naturally immune to the disease but those in poorer countries can have weaker immune systems and so have little immunity. If it is not treated, it causes permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. It can cause permanent disability and reduce life expectancy by 50 per cent.
