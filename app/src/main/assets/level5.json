It was the greatest seaport in late medieval Europe and Europe’s commercial and cultural link with Asia. It is also one of the world’s oldest tourist and cultural centres. Aditi De writes of her visit to this most romantic of cities.Venice is such a strange city. It is built on an Italian lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. It has canals instead of roads, which means there are no cars or buses, no trams or trains or bicycles whizzing past us. Best of all, we could walk or jump or play hide-and-seek on its cobbled streets or its countless bridges whenever we chose to.Daily life in Venice skims over its waterways, especially the sweeping double curve of the Grand Canal and the 180 smaller water passages that run through the 118 islands that make up the city.As we stop by a bridge over the canal for a minute, we spot blue ambulance boats weaving past red fireboats and police patrol boats. It made us stop for a minute to rethink. Weren’t these in place of the Red Cross ambulances, red fire engines and blue police vans we knew in other cities? Of course.But then, Venice is ruled by the lagoon it is built on. Leaning over the railings of St. Marcos Square in the city’s heart, we realise this as grey boats tow away the garbage, bright soft drink and ice-cream barges hawk their wares, and tooting tug boats guide huge ocean liners into Venice harbour.Just then, we spot what’s typical of Venice – a gondola! We hop into a gondola to be ferried from one canal bank to another, a ferry service known as traghetto, for 1,000 Italian lire (about Rs. 20). This typically Venetian watercraft, with gondoliers or boatmen in striped jumpers over black trousers with jaunty berets on their heads, now number only about 400. In the 16th century, there were 10,000 gondolas on the canals.For generations, tiny boatyards have built these lop-sided boats, with one side curving further outwards than the other. Why, we wonder? To balance the weight of the oarsman at the stern.All day long, we walk through the 3000-odd solid streets or passageways that dot the ten main islands apart from the mother city of Venice. We discover that Venice’s historic centre is built upon an archipelago or islets and mud banks that are just two miles long and a mile across. We stumble upon an amazing fact – that the house numbers in this unusual city run by the district, going up streets, through alleys and over canals.A Venetian friend tells us that Italians call the city Venezia, or La Serenissima, the Serene City. Venice was originally built on piles of stones dropped into the lagoon, over which planks of wood were laid. Of course, the bricks of the grand mansions on the canal often felt damp to the touch.That’s easy to believe when we hear about the aqua alta or high water. Caused by either spring tides atop the lagoon or an underground movement of the Italian peninsula, high water often causes the beautiful squares around Venice’s churches to turn into lakes, the roads into gushing rivers.That doesn’t however, stop Venetians from putting on their raincoats and gumboots, and going to school. For the government provides wooden platforms all over the city that are used as step ways to survive the aqua alta.This Italian city is known for its festivals, especially the popular ten-day Carnival in April. Children, teenagers and adults dress in freaky costumes, weird stockings and shoes, then don masks before they take part in this celebration. It’s difficult to make out who is behind each mask, but it’s easy to make friends during this constant party in the streets. What fun!On other occasions, Venetians celebrate with a regatta or boat race. The city loves the Vogalonga, on the first Sunday of May, best of all. That’s when anyone who can row with oars is welcome to join the other boats on the great Grand Canal, especially in fancy dress. Imagine the sight!Venice is an unusual city, but an equally unusual threat looms over it right now. It’s sinking. Since it’s built on a lagoon, the weight of the city on the silt beneath it threatens its very life. “Venice today is sinking three times as fast as before, at 300 mm per century,” explains an environmentalist.We shudder at the thought of beautiful Venice, with its stunning churches, its collections of art and its happy spirit, buried under the Adriatic. May the winged Lion of St. Mark, the symbol of Venice, never face that day.","keyword":"[\"venice\", \"canal\", \"lagoon\", \"boat\", \"italian\", \"venetian\"]","ALS":"27.333333333333332"},{"english_id":"200","id":"201","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"Abdul Kareem's Forest","article":"A lush green forest in the middle of a rocky wasteland. No, this paradise is not an illusion. Abdul Kareem has created it with his own hands.Kareem’s 30-acre forest is in Kasargode district, Kerala. It is home to 1,500 medicinal plants, 2,000 varieties of trees, rare birds, animals and insects. Agricultural scientist, MS Swaminathan, has called the forest a “wonderful example of the power harmony with nature.”So, how did Kareem manage to convert a wasteland into a forest?Let us go back 24 years, to 1977, when Kareem purchased a five-acre rocky wasteland. Kareem was an airlines ticketing agent with a craze for the woods. Though he never went to college, he could talk about the properties of plants and trees like an expert botanist, reportsThe Hindustan Times.Kareem dug a huge well and began to toil in the rocky, arid terrain. In the beginning, people thought he was crazy to waste his time and money on wasteland. But, Kareem has ‘green fingers’ (a term used for people who love nature). Soon, he began investing more and more of his savings to add land and amenities.Today, the ‘wasteland’ is the haven of nature-lovers – from students wanting to explore the woods, to agricultural scientists. Kareem has been honoured by several organisations, including the United Nations, for his work.He just let his forest grow naturally, without insecticides or fertilisers. He believed in the ability of nature to replenish itself without the interference of humans. That’s why he does not allow fallen leaves or twigs from the forest to be removed.Recently, Kareem even refused an offer by a well-known resort to launch an Ayurveda (ancient Hindu practice of holistic medicine) centre in the forest.“I wanted to spread the message that if trees, animals and birds survive, only then human beings have a future,” Kareem said in an interview.Shouldn’t we be listening?","keyword":"[\"kareem\", \"wasteland\", \"forest\", \"rocky\", \"abdul\", \"agricultural\"]","ALS":"28.23076923076923"},{"english_id":"201","id":"202","level":"5","topic":"2","title":"Alpana","article":"Thousands of years ago when humans did not know how to read and write he communicated by means of drawing pictures. The walls of caves where early man lived, whether it was in India or France, have been found to be full with primitive drawings. The art of alpana, practised by Indian women for centuries, is one such form of visual expression.Alpana has different names in different parts of India. In Bengal, it is Alpana, it is Kolam in south India, Rangoli in Maharashtra, Osa in Orissa, Aripana in Bihar, Sonarakha in Uttar Pradesh, Sathiya in Gujarat, Aripona in other regions of north India and Apna in western Himalayas.The art of creating various kinds of wall and floor patterns, Alpana patterns are mostly made by the women. These patterns are usually geometric or floral in nature. They are made from a variety of materials like coloured dals, rice, wheat, dyed sawdust, and colours.During Lakshmi puja in November, special alpanas of a pair of pretty feet are drawn, outside the homes of people. The feet belong to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and are meant to ensure prosperity to people.In spring, before the sowing of the seed, a tender green colour is used to draw the alpana. In autumn when the seeds mature, it is drawn in vibrant yellow and in winter at the time of harvesting, it is drawn in the brown-gold of the leaves of autumn. An important feature of the alpana is that the entire design should be an unbroken line. It is believed that gaps provide an entrance for evil spirits.Decorating the floor in different parts of the house is believed to be a good omen. The entrance decoration is a gesture of welcome. For over 3000 years, the women of Mithila have drawn wall and floor paintings to avert natural disasters, protect their crop, and pray for the well being of their husband and children.In Rome however, people painted their walls for a totally different reason. There were very few windows in their houses, so in order to decorate the empty walls they painted frescos. The artist applied a thin layer of plaster on the wall and then directly painted on the wet plaster.The ceilings and walls of the world famous Sistine Chapel, one of Rome’s most enduring landmarks, are covered in frescos that depict stories from the Bible. Michelangelo painted them in the 16th century.In India most tribal paintings were made on the mud walls of huts, terracotta figures, wooden sculpture and occasionally on leather, all materials that deteriorate fast. In fact most wall paintings were expected to disappear within a season so that another painting depicting a new season could be drawn. Floor patterns on the other hand were made daily to depict the beginning of a new day.Of all the wall and floor painters of India, the women of Madhubani are the most celebrated. They cover the wall with a coat of natural colour usually made with cow dung. Then they dip their finger in a rice paste to draw the patterns. They mostly draw scenes from the epics as well as local tales.In fact the notion of paintings on canvases that are displayed on the walls of art museums is a relatively modern one. They date from the time when a price began to be attached to this art form. The earliest paintings have always been made on walls and floors and ceilings, and they connected in a much more immediate way with people than many present day masterpieces on canvas.","keyword":"[\"wall\", \"alpana\", \"draw\", \"floor\", \"pattern\", \"painting\"]","ALS":"29.545454545454547"},{"english_id":"202","id":"203","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"Aristotle can't remain Ignorant!","article":"The Greeks were a passionately curious lot. When Alexander the Great set off in 334 BC on the famous expedition that took him over the Hindukush into Tashkent and Kashmir, he was accompanied not only by navigators, guides and surveyors, but historians and philosophers as well.Alexander had been taught by the philosopher Aristotle, and we are told that he ordered everyone throughout Greece and Asia who made their living by hunting, fowling, fishing, beekeeping and so on, to make sure that “Aristotle should not remain ignorant of any animal born anywhere.”So when Aristotle discusses elephants, it is the diet, digestive organs, teeth, age of maturity, and length of pregnancy of the Indian elephant that he is talking about, not the African variety.Aristotle himself argues in one of his most stirring passages that everything is worth investigating, however lowly. “We should not childishly complain against the enquiry into less worthy animals; for in everything natural there is something marvellous. We should approach the study of every animal without shame; for in all of them there is something natural and beautiful.”Aristotle the great greek philosopherAristotle firmly believed that we have a duty to know. That is what humans are there for, and that the spirit of enquiry is what leads them to happiness. He was convinced it is the closest that humans can come to being immortal.More about AristotleBorn at Stagira in Macedonia, Aristotle was one of the most influential philosophers of ancient Greece (the city state of Macedonia was under the rule of Athens, the towering symbol of Greek civilisation).He was the star disciple of the renowned philosopher, Plato, who studied under the great teacher, Socrates. At 17, Aristotle joined Plato’s academy in Athens, and remained there until the philosopher’s death.Between 343 and 340 BC, Aristotle tutored the young Macedonian, Alexander, later known as a great conqueror. In 335 BC he returned to Athens where he founded a school, the Lyceum.Here he organised and carried out research on many subjects, and built a great library in the belief that it was necessary for humans to probe every aspect of the world around them. On the death of Alexander, in 325 BC, anti-Macedonian feeling in Athens caused Aristotle to retire to Chalcis, where he died, in 322 BC.From the Woodpecker volume 2000, brought out by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehra Dun, in north India.

The tale of two simple village boys Goopy the singer and Bagha the drummer, who by a curious turn of fate, find themselves in the possession of boons by kindly ghosts.Teeming with interesting, ‘other-worldly’ characters and the toothless Borfi in his pointy hat and glasses, a wizened creature who cast naughty spells on all and sundry. Including the king whom he put to sleep for years and years. No prizes for guessing who wrote the lyrics or who Borfi was. Borfi was none other than Harindranath Chattopadhyay!But it wasn’t only mischief that this versatile personality was famous for. Everyone adored him for his satire and wit. His satire was earmarked by his appearance as a curd seller in his shows, an instant sell out. Harindranath’s first love was the theatre. He also loved to travel. The combination was devastating.Harindranath was a jack of all trades and that too without formal training in any of them. Actor, poet, satirist, musician, singer and painter, Harindranath Chattopadhyay was a multi-faceted vibrant personality. In the year 2000, an exhibition of Harindranath’s vibrant and never-seen-before pictures was held at the Art Bazaar in Kidderpore in Calcutta. In fact close friends didn’t even know he painted!Perhaps that is why everything he did had a wonderful, childlike quality to it. His paintings, like the rooster for example, are striking. Many of these were made of crayons, with bright colours as if drawn by a restless, talented kid. His paintings reveal that Harindranath was well aware of the styles of modern artists.A free spirit, Harindranath hated the nine-to-five work routine. He was always the amateur and indulged in the arts without taking up any particular branch as a profession. He hosted shows abroad through which he showcased aspects of Indian life and culture. He would perform in them too. His most popular performance was as a curd seller. He would appear on stage carrying two vessels of curd, and recite catchy rhymes satirising day-to-day life or famous personalities. Audiences loved it and invariably after every performance would give him a standing ovation. He was invited abroad many times just to perform this show.He enjoyed life to the fullest. In fact when he wrote the lyrics for ‘Julie’ he was quite an old man. The song was entirely in English -the first Indian film song in English – and the film, a teenage love-story!Harindranath was the brother of the freedom fighter Sarojini Naidu who was also better known as the Nightingale of India. Born in a family of talented people, his father was Aghornath Chattopadhyay, who was the principal of Hyderabad Nizam College. Besides Sarojini, his brother Birendranath, assisted Lenin, the great Russian socialist.

It was first known as Kashi, the city of light, when it was the capital of the kingdom of the same name about 500 BC.For over 2000 years, Banaras the eternal city has been the religious capital of India. Built on the banks of sacred Ganga it is said to combine the virtues of all other places of pilgrimage and anyone who ends their earthly cycle here is said to be transported straight to heaven.Banaras was also celebrated as the place where the most profound wisdom dwelt, the seat of all enlightenment and learning. Its permanent advantages include the highest sanctity, fertile soil, and its location on a great river. Hindu rulers built great palaces, temples, and ghats in the city. It is also mentioned in late Vedic literature and in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The city encompasses Sarnath, where Buddha preached his first sermon in about 530 BC.From the 4th to the 6th century, Banaras was a great cultural centre, but the onset of Muslim occupation in 1193 resulted in the city’s decline and the destruction of its ancient temples. For nearly six centuries, the city was under Muslim rule. The first raid by Muslims, who sacked and plundered some Hindu temples, occurred about AD 1035. Banaras was finally conquered in 1194 when an Afghan general according to Muslim historians, destroyed nearly a thousand temples and carried off his booty on the back of 1,400 camels.Temples continued, however to be destroyed and rebuilt, with some emperors taking part in both activities at different times, until the last episode of destruction by Mughal emperor Aurangazeb in 1669.In the early years, say 1,000 BC, Kashi’s inland acres, behind the high bank of the river were known as the forest of bliss. There beside its ponds and lakes, under the trees, gurus, and their students, ascetics, meditators, scholars, and disciples made their hermitages, their classrooms.However the essence of the place is that it is a holy city, the most sacred place on the 1,560 mile course of the sacred Ganga river. And it is because of this fact that princes and conquerors, merchants and artisans came to it and left their mark on it. And it is why the pilgrims come. The allure of Banaras is great, for the Hindu who dies here attains moksha or liberation.Holiest of cities to Hindus and earthly abode of Lord Shiva, Banaras is a beacon for pilgrims who come to bathe in the sacred Ganga river. There are pandas ( brahmin priests) who wait by the ghats to assist pilgrims. For a small contribution, such men provide food and flowers for offerings and coach the uncertain in their prayers.There are two important paths that pilgrims usually take. One route starts at the Manikarnika Ghat with a ritual bath and devotions performed along the way south to the Panchkroshi road. The road makes a wide loop enclosing the sacred city, and ends on the north at the confluence of the Varuna river and the Ganga. Pilgrims make this journey on foot, starting well before daybreak, stopping at 108 ritual places of worship. The complete pilgrimage takes five days.The other pilgrimage path takes the devotees to the five tirthas. The first of these is at the Asi ghat where the pilgrim bathes and then follows the Ganga north (downstream) along the famous riverfront, making his offerings and prayers as he goes. As you walk northward from Asi the first important ghat you reach is Tulsi, named for the late 116th century poet Tulsidas, best known for making the great Sanskrit epic The Ramayana accessible to ordinary people in his Hindi version.Banaras contains more than 1,500 temples and mosques. Almost all of the city’s 5 km of river banks have been converted into ghats. Banaras on the whole has 100 bathing and burning ghats, of which Manikarnika ghat is the most sacred. This is the main burning ghat and one of the most auspicious places.Day and night the fires burn at Manikarnika ghat and the remains of the dead are scattered upon the river. To die in Banaras is to die blessed; many move here to live out their final days.The multitudes of pilgrims are among the largest source of revenue to the city. With a constant influx of visitors, Banaras is a haven for medicants – beggars who have quit their worldly pursuits.The best ghat to hang around is Dasaswamedh. Here you will find myriad people doing myriad things. You will see people bathing, excercising, pandas performing pujas and so on.Apart from the ghats lining the river, city’s other highlights includes a golden temple built in roofed quadrangle with stunning gilded towers and the Banaras Hindu University. BHU is one of the oldest and largest educational institutions and is one of India’s most prominent seats of learning. Founded in 1916 by the great nationalist and educator Pandit Madan Mohan Maliviya, BHU has a 1,300 acre campus on the outskirts of the city. Today one of the largest residential universities in India, it has schools of both the ancient Indian Ayurveda practice, colleges of engineering, agriculture, commerce, technology, music and fine arts, theology and oriental studies.It also has one of the finest museums the Bharat Kala Bhavan. There is even an astronomical observatory. The Arabic Centre of Islamic Studies is a reminder of the fact that more than 25 percent of the city’s population is Muslim.Centre for artisans as well as for the faithful, Banaras produces textile, apparel and carpets. Banaras’ weavers are well-known for their sarees in silk with gold and silver brocades. Jewellery, brasswork, lacquered toys are the other important handicraft products.","keyword":"[\"banaras\", \"ghat\", \"sacred\", \"pilgrim\", \"temple\", \"city\"]","ALS":"29.77777777777778"},{"english_id":"205","id":"206","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"Batik: Ancient Art of Painting in Wax","article":"A routine college day. We had to go for textile practicals after lunch. Going for any class post lunch was a pain. All we wanted to do was sleep. But, that remained a dream since we were always packed with classes after lunch. Lazily, I dragged myself to the textile laboratory.“Today we are going to learn the technique of batik but first let me brief you about it,” said the teacher.I was already bored. First theory and then the practical. What more could one ask for! Who wanted to know about a technique of dyeing with the strange name batik, anyway? Then I put aside these thoughts and decided to listen. After all, I would have to attempt it myself in a while.What followed took me by surprise. A most fascinating journey through different lands down the ages as the teacher unpeeled layer after layer of the beautiful secrets of batik.Close up of a Batik artist painting on a white cloth, IndonesiaThe art is believed to be more than a 1000 years old as evidence in the form of dyed fabric has been found in India, Egypt, China, Japan and Turkey. For a very long time, Indonesia has been recognised to be the seat of batik.The word batik itself is of Indonesian origin and means ‘wax writing’.An artist carefully traces the floral motif on a traditional batik fabric using melted waxNowadays, blocks made of copper are used to print patterns. These copper blocks or stamps are called ‘caps’ (pronounced as chops in Indonesian). They make the process faster. Each cap is made by twisting and bending a 1.5 centimetre copper strip in the shape of the pattern required. These are then soldered to another copper strip which is used as a handle.After the pattern is made, wax is applied to the areas where the colour is not needed. This is done using a small copper container with a long slender spout called canting. Canting is believed to be a purely Javanese invention. Melted wax is filled in the copper container and then applied to the cloth.While the artist is at work, he keeps a container full of melted wax constantly on the flame by his side. Generally, beeswax mixed with petrol-based paraffin wax is used.Assortment of colourful batik textile. Manamana \/ Shutterstock.comIn India the wax is applied with the help of a brush, mostly.After the application of the wax, the cloth is dipped into the desired colour. The portions that are covered with wax remain in their original form while the rest of the cloth gets dyed. The cloth is then immersed in cold water to harden the wax. It is finally left to dry. The process is repeated if more than one colour is used.After the dyeing is complete, the cloth is immersed in boiling water which melts the wax. It is then that the batik pattern surfaces.To get the marble paper effect, the wax is deliberately cracked before placing the cloth in the dye bath. The dye seeps into the tiny cracks and creates fine lines.The number of colours used indicate the number of times the cloth has been dyed. Traditionally, blue, brown and red colours were used in batik, but now several others are used as well. Batik fabrics are used to make anything and everything in India today – from shirts and tops to bedspreads, scarves, tablecloths…the themes vary from abstract paintings to mythological figures.By the time the teacher ended his lecture, I was sitting erect in class, and was very excited. I was impatient to put my own stamp of batik on a fabric. I did, too. How successful was I at it, you’d want to know? Well, that is another story.","keyword":"[\"batik\", \"copper\", \"cloth\", \"fabric\", \"pattern\", \"melt\"]","ALS":"20.441176470588236"},{"english_id":"206","id":"207","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"Bidriware","article":"_Pallo latke gori ko pallo latke…_The music of this famous Rajasthani folk song filled the air at the Crafts Museum in New Delhi where I went one Monday afternoon. Sitting in the verandah were rows of people who had displayed their work. What work it was too! My heart soared looking at all the things that they had crafted.It was all so beautiful that I could not help but talk to the artisans who had created them. That is when I met Shyamala, the bidri maker. She sat in a corner with the pallu of her sari over her head, fanning herself to get some relief from the searing heat. There was no customer with her at that time, so I took the opportunity for a little chitchat with her.After introducing myself I began asking Shyamala about the kind of work she did. She seemed a little bored at first. I told her that my purpose was to tell other children about this traditional art and explain to them how she creates such beautiful pieces. She was delighted on hearing that and began to talk to me in earnest.Bidri is the art of engraving and inlay, passed down to Indian craftsmen about 400 years ago from Persia. Though it is derived from Persian art, Bidri is an Indian innovation. The basic material used is an alloy of zinc in place of the copper used by the Persians. Bidri takes its name from its original home, Bidar a town in Karnataka. Lucknow, Purnea and Murshidabad are other important centres.The beauty of Bidriware lies in the striking contrast between the black base and metal inlaid. The whole process requires a lot of hard work. The metal inlaid is silver. However, the black base is not originally black. Initially it is cast with an alloy of zinc, copper and other metals, which do not react with iron. Beautiful designs are engraved with a chisel. A silver wire is put in the grooves and polishing is done with a buffing machine.This product is then dipped into a solution, prepared from the soil of the fort of Bidar. This soil has special oxidising properties. It reacts with some metals. Silver is not affected by this magic soil treatment but zinc alloy turns shiny black.

Do I really want to go ahead with this foolishness? Shouldn’t I be back with my feet firmly planted on the ground?I was standing on the platform of a 100-ft high bridge. My fingers tightly holding the rails in a death grip. I was about to do a bungee jump because I had boasted to Himakar, my cousin, I could do anything he could. At that time didn’t take into account such craziness. Then I was full of false courage and so I let my cousin arrange for this jump on a lazy Sunday morning. He had fixed it with a local sports operator.I have done many stupid things in life but I didn’t expect this particular foolishness to scare me as much as it did now. Taking this swan dive off this platform with just a largish rubber band tied to my body can only be termed a madcap and Xtreme sport. Also the 90 ft drop seemed like 900 metres from here! Where’s my momma?But before the day dawned, I was curious to know about this sport – bungee?? bungy? Was the difference only in the way the Americans spell it and how the rest of the world spells it? Well, not exactly but its one of the reasons.Actually there are two types of bungee jumping. Bungy, which originated in New Zealand and Australia, consists of rubber cords (with no elongation limitation) and it offers lower velocity and higher rebound but a smoother ride. While Bungee, the American variation, refers to the use of military-specification shock cords. Shock cords allow for a longer freefall but with a higher g-force, and greater hang-time on rebounds. Definitely not for the faint hearted.The actual origin of bungee jumping come from the ritual practiced by the “land divers” of the Bunlap tribe in Pentecost Island in the New Hebrides. Tradition has it a man called Tamalie, mistreated his wife. So she ran away and climbed a banyan tree. He followed her but she tied lianas or long creepers to her ankles. Just as Tamalie reached out to grab her, she jumped and he jumped too. The lianas saved her life, but he died.What excuse do I have right now, to back out? All my stupid friends were near by cheering me on. I dare not tell them my knees felt like jelly or that ankle straps make me feel like a convict with a leaden ball and chain attached. Suddenly the countdown begins. My heart pounds faster and faster...5..4..3..2..1.. heeeeellllllppppp! Before I knew it I was off the edge of the platform. Was it willing or with a friendly shove I didn’t know for sure. I realised for a micro second that I was floating in mid air before the earth’s gravity took over. I was plumming downward at 60+ miles.Unlucky for me, traveling at that speed on elastic bands is not yet outlawed! I stepped into space falling through a zone of pure animal fear. The next instant the river was zooming towards me at high speed. The wind was whipping my fear-stricken face as I plunged down towards the earth. I could feel the cords tug my harness. And then. . . I stopped just 5 feet short of the water. My hands lightly skimming the water.As I breathed a sigh of relief, the cord shot me upward at lightning speed. There was no snap in the elastic turnaround just a smooth, heavy slow-down, then swoosh. I cart-wheeled and took the second drop out of shape and out of control.I was busy trying to grasp the cord to hold on to something. As I tried to hold the cord, it viciously smacked me in the forehead and my bottom. I got busy fending off the cord and did exactly what I’d been told not to. When the thrashing finally stopped, I hugged the bungee and thanked my stars. I was safe a few feet away from the water.Bungee is a certified sport. Bungee operators offer jumps from cranes, balloons, helicopters, bridges, towers, platforms and the sport is growing from jump to jump. It is wise to check the operator’s experience for the equipment you will use and the type of jump you will do before doing it. Accidents are relatively always minor injuries such as skin burn, or getting slapped in the face or body by gripping the cord, which you are instructed not to do.It is a strange sport well appreciated by the public, safe and sound at a distance. Bungee jumpers take pleasure in diving off anything, much like a matador with only a red cape faces a mad bull cheered undoubtedly by a crowd safe above the barricades.As with all things American a zing has been added to this sport: ‘Slingshotting’ (from the ground up), ‘sandbagging’ (jumping with extra weight), ‘bodydipping’ (over water), etc. Other variations include jumping with your back to the ground. Jumpers admit that this is quite scary and it takes greater effort to let your hand go off the rail. When you can see what you are jumping into you can convince yourself into a jump.Whatever your own preference just keep telling yourself it is fun and RELAX (which I didn’t do but which you should do) and you will have a great time. Now that I am a pro at it with one jump I am impatiently looking towards next Sunday for my second jump.","keyword":"[\"jump\", \"bungee\", \"platform\", \"sport\", \"safe\", \"speed\"]","ALS":"19.77777777777778"},{"english_id":"211","id":"212","level":"5","topic":"7","title":"Chess for Children: A Smart Move","article":"When we think of chess we think of two adults sitting opposite each other, thinking of ways and means to outsmart the other. Many people feel it is a very difficult game. But do you know that most chess players and champions start very young?Viswanathan Anand, number two in the world, played his first chess game at the age of five. This was in 1974. Anand’s mother taught him the game and was his first opponent. In no time he came to be called the Lightning Kid. This was because he made his moves with such speed. In 1987, Anand won the world junior championship, in the Philippines. He was the first Asian ever to do so.Take the example of world champion Jose Raul Capablanca of Cuba. He was born in 1888 and picked up chess at the age of four by watching his father play. Capablanca Jr’s father was his first opponent. Similarly, Sammy Reshevsky of Poland also made his first moves on the chessboard at the age of four. By 1920, at the age of eight, he was busy touring the cities of Europe as the ‘wonder boy’ who could outplay adults.In India, the success of Viswanathan Anand has encouraged many youngsters to take to chess. Curly haired Koneru Humpy from the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh learnt chess at the age of six from her father. The youngster won the World under-10 Championship at Cannes, France, in 1997. In 2002, at the young age of 15 years, four months and 28 days, Humpy joined the select batch of world class chess masters, called Grandmaster or GM. Her inspiration? Judith Polgar of Hungary, who earned the title of Grandmaster in 1991 at the age of 15 years and four months.Chess for Children: A Smart MoveBut Humpy was not the youngest from India to become a Grandmaster. A little earlier, Pentyla Harikrishna, also from the same state as Humpy, had become a Grandmaster at the age of 15 years, three months and five days! Harikrishna learnt chess from his grandfather when he was five years old.But these young players have faced stiff competition from another ‘master’. Parimarjan Negi, from India’s capital Delhi, became the second youngest player in the world to get the title of Grandmaster in July 2006. He was 13 years, four months and 22 days old. Sergey Karajakin of Ukraine holds the record for the youngest player to become a Grandmaster. He was 12 years and seven months in 2002 when he achieved this feat! Clearly, these youngsters believe in the slogan ‘chess for children’ rather than only ‘chess for adults’.It is also true that not everyone who plays the sport becomes a champion. Yet, it is a fact that the world has become chess crazy, especially as far as chess for children is concerned. In India, the southern city of Chennai was for long called the chess capital of India. After all it produced champions like Viswanathan Anand, Manuel Aaron and V. Ravi Kumar. Today the craze has spread across the country. The number of chess clubs has increased, as well as the number of tournaments played through the year. In Russia and several other European countries, as well as in Canada, chess is part of the school curriculum.In fact this is one game that helps the player in many, many ways and not only on the chess board. To play better, it becomes necessary to read chess books. So no one will accuse you of not being interested in reading! You have to be able to keep scores, so your arithmetic gets strengthened. More importantly, you are the general of your army on the board and have to think carefully before making any move. Otherwise your opponent will corner your troops. For this you have to be able to think of various moves and choose the best possible move. Naturally, your thinking becomes faster and you learn to decide faster. Next time you have to choose between a present of books, roller skates or a play station, such decision making skills will benefit you! Lastly, you have to try your hardest to win, but that does not mean you hate your opponent. Remember, you have to shake hands with the other contestant before and after a game.So, don’t be put off chess by thinking it’s too ‘brainy’ for you. Put on your thinking cap and shout out loud: chess for children!","keyword":"[\"chess\", \"grandmaster\", \"anand\", \"champion\", \"humpy\", \"player\"]","ALS":"20.166666666666668"},{"english_id":"212","id":"213","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"Children and Water","article":"Educators Wynne Harlen and Jos Elstgeest take us on a wonder-filled trip into the scientific world in their classic book: UNESCO sourcebook for science in the primary school, published by the National Book Trust in association with Unesco publishing.Water is a common yet exciting material, freely available almost everywhere, which lends itself to an endless variety of genuine science activities.

At New Delhi’s LTG Auditorium recently, a group of ‘disabled’ children left the audience spellbound with their natural, joyful performances. Some of the children could not hear, others could not see or had difficulty walking. And still others were grappling with mental challenges. But that was no dampener to their spirits as they performed to an appreciative audience of eager parents, teachers and children.Dancing to GloryThe Annual Inter School Dance-Drama Festival saw over 300 children from 20 schools all over Delhi, participate in the event. What was important was the manner in which all of them overcame their challenges to become performers with joyous abandon.The theme of the festival was seasons. Each school had to depict a particular season using dance, free movement or mime, but no dialogue. While some children danced to the chilly winds of winter, others rejoiced at the onset of spring. Still others did a delightful monsoon dance. The result was a perky, spontaneous performance by the children, which enthralled everyone present.Some of the young actors were so pleased with their own performance that they refused to leave the stage. They wanted to dance all over again!The schools participating were Aanchal, Model School, Kulachi Hansraj, Balwant Rai Mehta, Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan, Enabling Centre and the Special Wings of Shri Ram School and Sanskriti School, to name a few.A new aspect was added to the festival for the first time. It enabled children without disabilities and those with physical and mental disabilities to perform together. It was called the Integrated Group. Both groups worked together for weeks to come up with a beautiful dance-drama.So good were all the children, that it was difficult to spot the difference. They were seen for what they were – a group of friends working towards a common goal. The Shri Ram School and the Enabling Centre put up a dazzling performance in this category.The festival is now in its sixth year. It is organised annually by Very Special Arts India, a non governmental organisation (NGO) working with the disabled.The people who work in this NGO feel that creative arts are a very good way for people with mental and physical challenges to gain confidence.The idea is that no mental or physical challenge need limit the human potential to create. The NGO organises artistic events for children and adults to show their talents to the rest of society.And indeed, there wasn’t a trace of nervousness in the children who performed at the festival. There was a great eagerness to perform, for each child knew that it was his or her ability alone that was being judged. Many of the children went back with medals and trophies, but every child went back with something far more important. A big smile and a real sense of achievement.","keyword":"[\"mental\", \"challenge\", \"festival\", \"performance\", \"physical\", \"school\"]","ALS":"25.047619047619047"},{"english_id":"216","id":"217","level":"5","topic":"18","title":"Dia's Story","article":"Dia, an 80-year-old labourer of Indian origin, lives in the corner of a cotton field in the western province of Kanchanaburi, Thailand. His rundown shack contains very little besides a military medal and a few clothes. The medal is a remnant of Dia’s eventful, if tragic, past.It is a past that has included a stint at Myanmar (then Burma), as a prisoner captured by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II (1939 – 45). During this time he was made to work in the construction of a railway between Burma and Thailand.Railway of DeathDia has lived for years in obscurity in Thailand, doing menial jobs to support himself. But now he has been given a chance to tell his side of the story. A Japanese film-maker Hideki Nakamura, made a documentary on Dia and other prisoners of war who were involved in the construction of the railway. The documentary is called:Railway of Death: Those Left Behind.The documentary narrates the story of the Asian prisoners of the Japanese Imperial Army. These men had been captured while fighting for the Allies – countries like Britain that were their rulers as well. Japan was on the side of Germany and Italy.India, being a British colony, was naturally expected to fight on behalf of Britain. Many Indian soldiers and others were sent to various countries in Asia (the Far East), Africa and Europe, to aid the British war-effort. Dia was one among many.The documentary highlights the plight of prisoners such as Dia and the subsequent years of loneliness and misery that all of them faced at being left behind in a strange land.So brutalised is Dia due to the experiences of the war, that he is unable to speak today. Nakamura say it is because of his great loneliness and sorrow from being separated from home.“He kept nodding when I asked him about his work for the Japanese military,” says Nakamura in the report by Inter Press Service, published in ‘The Telegraph’.Dia’s gestures have convinced Nakamura that he must have worked on the long railway that was constructed between Thailand and Burma by the Japanese army.Weed PickerIn one scene in the film, Nakamura takes Dia to the railway site and watches as the old man suddenly starts to pick weeds. He picks the weeds for hours suggesting that he is doing it out of force of habit.Nakamura says this must have been Dia’s work at the site of construction of the railway for several years, till the end of World War II. Another moving scene shows Dia tracing with a finger his route through Burma to Thailand.Hollywood got there firstThe “death” railway was made famous by the Hollywood motion picture of 1957, ‘Bridge on The River Kwai’. The film featured the experiences of prisoners from the Allied forces who were used to build a 415-kilometre-long bridge.More than 60,000 Allied prisoners of war were reported to have worked on the railway. Of these 15,000 died, many of them succumbing to either malaria or harsh working conditions at the Japanese-run camps.Nakamura’s ViewpointBut Nakamura is of the view that many more men were brought from South and Southeast Asia and forced to work on the railway. He estimates the number to be around 100,000.“Apart from Dia, I met several Thai men who said they had to work for the Japanese army,” he says. “The reason I decided to film this documentary was to publicise their plight that is hardly known as compared to their western counterparts”.And that is why his attempt to narrate the stories of Dia and the others becomes doubly significant.","keyword":"[\"railway\", \"nakamura\", \"prisoner\", \"documentary\", \"burma\", \"japanese\"]","ALS":"37.166666666666664"},{"english_id":"219","id":"220","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Francoise's Dolls","article":"“I did not see the face of my child: I passed into unconsciousness after her birth. My neighbours told me she was beautiful. My mother and the nurse buried her alive. I did not even hear her cry.”A doll depicts a girl child and the words alongside it, movingly tells the tale of a new mother’s anguish at the brutal killing of her baby girl.The doll has been made by Belgian-born Francoise Bosteels, who made India her home over 25 years ago. Francoise’s dolls ‘speak’. They speak of the beauty of life and its celebration, but also of the injustice, anger and frustration of those in despair.The little shepherd boy bending to cuddle his lamb, the widow in a white sari, the fish worker who has no fish to give to her children – each of Francoise’s dolls have a story to tell. Each one brings a certain kind of Indian alive.The dolls are elegantly made and strike realistic poses. They are an expression of the dreams, hopes, discoveries, friendships, tears, protests and anger of their creator – Francoise. The ‘Deccan Herald’ wrote about her in an article.Francoise came to India in 1974 to help the sick in the villages of Tamil Nadu. A nun who is also a nurse by training, Francoise became involved in the social and health education programmes and in leprosy prevention and care. It was in India that Francoise made a serious foray into doll making with a Christmas crib. But she had become aware of her artistic side much earlier, at seventeen. Confined to bed for months due to an illness, she had made her first doll.In the course of her work in India, as she rode around the villages on her bicycle, she found that there was a lot to depict. There were many types of people – beggars, street children, landless labourers, widows, rape and dowry victims. All with varying reactions to situations around them.So Francoise began to make dolls that addressed the troublesome issues plaguing the lives of the people. The exploitation, the poverty, the hunger, but at the same time, the joys and hope, too.Francoise’s dolls are made of ordinary material. A variety of colourful cloth called feutre, strong paper ribbons, pipe cleaners, cotton balls for heads, wool, thread and discarded bobbins, silk and cotton cut-pieces, banana and coconut fibre, palm leaves, tamarind skin, bamboo, pieces of wood, small plastic boxes and bottles. Throwaway items that is recycled into beautiful pieces of art by the magical fingers of Francoise.She also uses gold and silver threads to make a variety of jewellery. The figures of the dolls are held together with the help of thread and gum.The dolls have one unusual feature – they are faceless. “That’s because these dolls could be anyone – from among the people that live around us. It could be me, you, us”, explains Francoise.Faceless or not, they have become famous. At a workshop in Philippines on Globalisation and its Impact on People’s Life, Francoise was invited to present these dolls to illustrate some of the issues that came up during the workshop. It was here that some women participants suggested that a book be published with pictures of these dolls and brief write ups to go with them.The dolls could help people understand such aspects of globalisation ( the process of moving towards a world in which people produce, distribute, sell, finance and invest without regard to national boundaries ), that tend to diminish the quality of life of people in poorer countries like India. So Francoise’s dolls are the subject of a beautifully brought out book ‘The Dolls Speak’, published by Better World Publications.Francoise’s dolls are stark portrayals of those living on the margins of society. They tell everything as it is. These dolls have the ability to ‘speak’ eloquently about things that would take a lifetime of words to understand.","keyword":"[\"doll\", \"francoise\", \"globalisation\", \"speak\", \"thread\", \"nurse\"]","ALS":"27.814814814814813"},{"english_id":"223","id":"224","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"Instrument with a Human Tone","article":"A family of musicians in the city of Mysore, in Karnataka, has a unique family heirloom — a beautiful 300-year-old veena. The veena is India’s most ancient Indian stringed instrument.The veena is a poly chord instrument, that is, it is made of several strings. Each string produces a certain tone, which other strings cannot duplicate. Melody is produced when the strings are plucked.The Deccan Herald reports that the veena belongs to a family of well-known veena players or vainikas, as they are known. Veena maestro, Veene Shamanna, came from this family. Shamanna was one of the renowned musicians of the Mysore Royal Durbar or Court of the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore, over 300 years ago.In those days, it was the practice among royal durbars to patronise the best talent of the region. Their prestige and fame depended on their ability to attract talented artists.Durbars like those at Mysore were the hub of artistic and intellectual activity, and drew the finest musicians, artists and intellectuals of the period, to them.It was to be part of the charmed circle at Mysore, that Veene Shamanna’s grandfather, Lakshamana Bhagwata travelled from Thanjavur, in Tamil Nadu, in 1728. With him came his prized veena. He was appointed to teach the veena to the princess of the Wodeyar family.His son, Rama Bhagvata, was an expert in playing the instrument. Then came Veene Shamanna, who became musician-par-excellence in the court of the Wodeyar rulers. He credited a large part of his success to his veena, which by then, had acquired quite a reputation.Shamanna’s cousin Subramanya Iyer, was the author of the first book on veena in Kannada, ‘Sangeetha Samerasa’. He, too, played the fabled veena.Veene Shamanna’s instrument is one of the oldest in the country. The surprising thing is, it is still intact. The veena weighs about five kg. Despite having been used by so many people, notes played on the veena are as effective as before.Saraswati VeenaVeene Shamanna’s veena is an example of the famed Saraswati veena, the queen of all veenas. The Saraswati veena is very versatile and the most beautiful of all veenas. It holds a special place in Carnatic music, the classical music form of south India.The Saraswati veena’s present structure was developed at Thanjavur around the 17th century. The instrument is made entirely of wood.In Hindu mythology, the veena is known as the instrument of Goddess Saraswati, just as the flute is that of Lord Krishna. Saraswati is the Goddess of all muses and is known as the veena pustaka dharini or one who holds the divine source of sound and wisdom. That is why no picture, icon or poem of her is complete without the veena and the ‘pustaka’ or book, writes B.C. Deva in ‘Musical Instruments’.The myth of Saraswati and the veenaA story in the Vedas beautifully illustrates how Saraswati came to be associated with the veena. The gods and asuras (demons) were fighting over Saraswati or Vani (speech) as she was known for she represented the power of sound or speech. Each group wanted the power of her speech for the chanting of mantras in their ‘yagna’ or vedic sacrifice.But Vani ran away into the forests, and took away speech with her. She made the drum, flute and the stringed instrument or veena speak with her natural voice.Finally of course, she was convinced to return and serve the yagna as mantra. And that’s how the veena is said to possess a sound that is the closest to the human voice.Tracing the sound of veena to the hunting bowThe veena is the most ancient stringed instrument known in India. It enjoys a very superior position in the hierarchy of Indian musical instruments.The first mention of it occurs in the Rig Veda, the earliest example of a literary work in India. The Rig Veda is a compilation of 1028 hymns in homage of the Vedic gods, composed and memorised over 3000 years ago.The origins of the veena lie in bow-shaped harps. Did you know that the harp, in turn, traces its origins to the hunter’s bow?The twang of the bowstring probably gave early humans the idea of attaching a set of parallel strings to the same bow. They found that different notes could be obtained and the harp was born as a result of their efforts.Different kinds and different soundsThe veena has evolved over the centuries and there are many different types played. The ‘villadi vadyam’ found in Tamil Nadu and Kerala is one of the simplest.The Vedic veena known as the ‘maha’ or great veena, on the other hand, had 100 strings of spun grass and was played with two bamboo pieces!The SitarTo the followers of Indian classical music, especially the southern Carnatic music, the mention of veena brings to mind the name of musicians like Veena Balachandar and Chitti Babu, who revealed the genius of the instrument to music lovers.Today, however, the North Indian version of the veena, the sitar, is more popular. It is a long-necked lute, and could be the invention of 13th century Persian poet-musician, Amir-Khusrau.But the sitar was not considered a respectable Indian instrument till a century ago. Any outsider who wanted to learn the veena used be taught the sitar by traditional veena ustads (maestros). It was believed to be lowly enough for the learning of those not part of the ustad’s gharana or family.Now of course, the sitar is the wonder instrument from India. Renowned classical musicians like Pandit Ravi Shankar have brought the sitar centrestage in recitals within Indian and abroad.The veena, in contrast, seems to have entered a quieter phase. It is as if it is waiting for Saraswati to speak through it again.","keyword":"[\"veena\", \"instrument\", \"saraswati\", \"shamanna\", \"sitar\", \"string\"]","ALS":"30.714285714285715"},{"english_id":"224","id":"225","level":"5","topic":"16","title":"Joining Hands for peace, at Hiroshima","article":"Every year, on August 6 and 9, a peace memorial conference is held in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Thousands of people from all over the world gather there to indicate their support for peace in a world that is free of nuclear weapons. Dr Srimanjari, who teaches History at Miranda House, Delhi University, took part in one such conference, in 1998. She shares her experience, saying that the visit was a real eye-opener for her.How does one talk about peace? By sharing memories of pain with those who did not, over generations, so that the desire for peace become stronger. In the peace conference that Srimanjari attended, there were over ten thousand participants, who came from all walks of life.There were members of organisations working for peace or peace activists from over 30 countries, Japanese teachers, doctors, lawyers, students, and women who had brought their children along. And there were the hibakushas or atomic bomb survivors whose voices were the the most important, remembers Srimanjari.In quiet tones they spoke about the unimaginable changes that came in their lives after the atomic bomb blast: the unforgettable sight of people dying the most violent deaths all around, loss of family, a lifetime wait for members who remained untraceable, and an unending story of agonising illnesses, like cancer, caused by radiation, and most important, the realisation that they could never lead normal lives, says Srimanjari.A photographic exhibition at the conference venue showed the extent of human suffering at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, recalls Srimanjari. “There were photographs of people jumping into the river to save their lives after they were burned…. Mothers didn’t know where their children were after the bomb.”The history teacher remembers her visit to a hospital in Hiroshima. Most of thehibakushas were suffering from leukemia and respiratory diseases. Most of the men had Spermia – a disease in which the sperm count goes down. Many survivors were suffering from malnutrition and could not eat properly. But because of what they went through, the hibakushas were very active in the peace movement even though they were physically inactive.In 1998 there were about three lakh survivors (including the first and second generation survivors), and almost as many people had died earlier, says Srimanjari. The hibakusha have one demand: total abolition of nuclear weapons, and the strong belief that no one should ever suffer the way they have suffered.That is one reason why many hibakusha do not like the fact that the Japanese government continues to live under the defence umbrella of the United States of America, that is, Japan has allowed US warships to have a base in Japan, explains Srimanjari. (For, after Japan surrendered to the US in the Second World War, it was forbidden to have its own army. That’s the way it remains to this day.)The atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. From 1945 to 1954, Japan was under the occupation of US forces. In those years, there was very little mention of the condition of the hibakushas, and no organisation by the survivors to demand a ban on nuclear weapons. Nuclear tests were being carried out even then.But things changed in 1954, says Srimanjari. That year, many Japanese fishermen died in a hydrogen bomb test conducted in the Pacific Islands. The terrible facts of nuclear radiation came to light. For, till then, even the people of Japan had no real knowledge of what had happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The hibakushas had spent 10 years with hardly any help from the authorities.The Japanese government had not given any compensation to the bomb survivors. Mrs Matsui, who was among the people present at the conference, said that she had fought the cases of hibakushas for compensation, says Srimanjari.She remembers how one by one, many hibakushas came onto the stage and spoke about the untold losses that they have suffered due to the atomic bombing. “Those who were two years old when the bomb dropped could walk only when they were six years old and some of them were completely paralysed.”One of them said that it had been her dream to look beautiful and healthy. Would that wish ever come true, she asked. All of them spoke of how the bomb destroyed their childhood and youth. That there should be no more hibakushas in the times to come, was their one hope.Eveybody at the conference felt that there should be more interactions between people of different countries, says Srimanjari. They all felt that governments would follow if the people spoke out strongly for peace and against war. The hibakushas have travelled widely all over the world, including the US, to share their experiences with common people.Hundreds of schools, too, participated in the conference and that made all the difference. It also injected a feeling of hope, recalls Srimanjari. There were students from USA, UK, China, Pakistan and the Pacific Islands. The children had made beautiful paper cranes carrying the message of peace, and composed songs of peace. In the evening they organised peace marches.As in all such conferences, there was a peace signature campaign where everyone signed their names, expressing their desire for a nuclear-free world. Such peace meetings spread awareness, says Srimanjari. “How many people know that there are nuclear tests constantly carried out in the Pacific islands? A lot of people there have silently died as a result of radiation.”They all left the conference with renewed determination that “when we all join hands together our voices will be effective.”","keyword":"[\"peace\", \"srimanjari\", \"hibakushas\", \"conference\", \"nuclear\", \"bomb\"]","ALS":"27.263157894736842"},{"english_id":"225","id":"226","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"Juneteenth: Celebrating End of Slavery in the United States of America","article":"June + nineteenth => JuneteenthA holiday to celebrate the end of slavery and the freeing of slaves. Also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Liberation Day, and Emancipation DayJuneteenth (19th of June, 1865) is one of the most important days celebrated by the African American community in the United States of America. For it was on this day, 19th of June in the year 1865 that a majority of slaves were informed that they were free. However, they were informed two years after slavery was made illegal in the US.Slavery is the treatment of humans as private property of other humans and forcing them to work against their will. The early United States of America was built on the backs of slaves shipped from Africa. The cotton industry of the southern states benefited the most from slavery because it meant that landowners could get labor for little or no money.The first recorded African slave in the US was in 1526 and it took 330 years for slavery to be abolished in the country.In the presidential election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln supported banning slavery. After he won, the southern states rose up in protest and voted to leave the United States. Their economies were based on slavery and nearly half of their population were slaves. To remove slavery would radically change these states. The slave-owners were terrified that their positions of power would weaken. They left the United States and the country was torn apart leading to the Civil War (1861 to 1865). The northern states were now at war against their southern brothers.Map of United States of America: Areas covered by the Emancipation Proclamation are in red. Slave-holding areas not covered are in blue.Emancipation ProclamationLincoln was fighting to create one America. However, he could not decide everything for the states. The central government had the right to decide some things, the rest were decided by the states. At the time, slavery was a state issue. Lincoln had no legal footing to abolish slavery. He found an interesting workaround. The southern states were at war against the northern states. A president has broad powers during war time. Abolishing slavery would not only cripple the economy of the southern states but it would also allow Lincoln to turn the free slaves into a standing army in the south. This was the real motivation behind the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln was not fighting against slavery because he thought it was wrong. His home states in the north still had slavery. He fought against slavery to win the Civil War. Regardless, the Proclamation applied to 3.5 million out of 4 million slaves in the country.Abraham Lincoln issued a declaration called the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. It looked to end slavery once and for all. But the slaves were never told this. It took nearly two and a half years for Lincoln to win the Civil War and send his generals to the southern states to inform the slaves that they were free.The northern states were called the ‘Union’ and the states in rebellion were called the ‘Confederates’. After the Emancipation Proclamation, many Confederate states refused to obey it. As far as they were concerned the Union had no authority over them. Furthermore, Lincoln could not force them to listen because there were very few Union troops in the Confederate states. This was particularly true for Texas. It had the lowest Union presence and many slave owners fled to Texas with their slaves for security. This is why what happened there was so important.Juneteenth (19th of June, 1865)On the 19th of June, 1865, Union leader General Gordon Granger took control of the last revolting state, Texas. The state had nearly a quarter of a million slaves and the general informed them that they were free. This is why we celebrate Juneteenth on the 19th of June. It is important to remember that this was only for the Confederate states at war. The slaves in the Union states were freed several months later when the government passed the Thirteenth Amendment and universally ended slavery.Over the next 30 years, Juneteenth was widely celebrated. The celebrations were used to educate the former slaves on voting rights, wages, and various other important topics. The celebrations reduced in the 19th century because tough laws made it hard for former slaves to earn money. The older generations were busy working and the younger generations were busy at school. Many of the youth did not feel the same connection to the holiday since they only had stories to understand its importance. Texas became the only state to recognize Juneteenth as a statewide holiday. This helped in reviving the holiday. It is celebrated with sports, a barbecue meal, the singing of songs, readings of African American authors, and the drinking of strawberry soda.Today, Juneteenth has particular relevance. It is a symbol of how justice is always delayed for African Americans. The idea behind the Confederacy, states fighting for their rights to own slaves is not in the dustbin of history. There are still too many who believe in the idea of Confederacy without understanding what it stood for. African Americans still face serious oppression and violence by the state. Juneteenth is a reminder of the battle for the freedom and equality of the African American community, and the work that still lies ahead.","keyword":"[\"slavery\", \"slave\", \"lincoln\", \"union\", \"emancipation\", \"juneteenth\"]","ALS":"19.294117647058822"},{"english_id":"229","id":"230","level":"5","topic":"1","title":"Magic of Kondapalli Toys","article":"Did you know that animals, birds, reptiles and humans learn the lessons of life through play? Any object can be used as a toy. Lion cubs even play with their parent’s tail! Human children play with objects of daily life, like spoons and cardboard boxes. But toys remain the favourite playthings of most children.In India, the oldest toys belong to the 5000 year-old Harappan civilisation. These toys were made with natural materials like clay, wood and stone. They depicted ordinary men, women, animals, birds, fruits and vegetables as well as the important professionals who existed in those times – the potter, carpenter and farmer, among others. And these ancient toys are surprisingly similar to the handmade toys of a later date.Many regions in India specialise in making toys. In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh for instance, the names of places such as Kondapalli, Nirmal, Ettikoppakka and Tirupati, are associated with wooden toys crafted with great style. A peep into the world of Kondapalli toys.Note the image of toys on the right. Don’t the figures give an impression of lifelike charm, like they are little people ready to jump out of the page any minute? Welcome to the world of Kondapalli toys.Kondapalli toys are made in and around Kondapalli, a little village in the Vijayawada district of Andhra Pradesh. The traditional craftsmen who make the famed toys are called Aryakshatriyas. The toys are made at home and the work involves the entire family. This traditional art form has been handed down from one generation to another. It continues to be the main livelihood of the people of Kondapalli.The craftsmen specialise in themes taken from their immediate surroundings. Scenes from rural life are carved and made into sets of various sizes.How are they made?Although it is difficult to infuse life into small blocks of wood, the Kondapalli toys are exceptions. They are very lively. Every small detail, including the appearance of the face, is looked into and carefully carved.Making these toys is no child’s play. It takes a very long time to fashion each one. The toys are made out of the locally-available soft Puniki wood, which is easy to carve. It is subjected to a process of slow heating, to draw out all the moisture. The limbs are carved separately and later joined to the body.The glue used consists mainly of paste made from tamarind seeds. The brushes used to colour the toys are very fine and sharp, made of goat’s hair. Both watercolours and oil paints are used to paint. The carving tools used are drill, hammer, axe, bagudari, aakrai (file) and chisels for finer work.From Mythology to Animals!Mythology, rural life and animals are the main themes on which the toys are made. Swans, peacocks and parrots are popular themes too, as are slice-of-life themes: women drawing water from a well, snake charmers, elephant with a mahout (trainer) on its back, potters, etc. Mythological figures are great favourites. Lord Krishna, the playful God, is shown playing the flute with a cow listening on.Kondapalli toys bring colour and joy. They create awareness about rural life and folklore through play. Can you think of a better way to learn about the richness of Indian mythology?In these days of mass-produced Barbie dolls, these beautiful folk toys are a reminder that each one, made by hand and so painstakingly, is unique – and it creates a beautiful connection with the world around for the child.","keyword":"[\"kondapalli\", \"theme\", \"carve\", \"rural\", \"mythology\", \"potter\"]","ALS":"21.322580645161292"},{"english_id":"231","id":"232","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"Mind the Manners!","article":"Neeru and Shama were planning a trip to Europe for a holiday. They had been through all the travel catalogues, Lonely Planet series, and Michelins to plan their travel and stay. From friends and foren returned relatives they knew the weather backwards and had both warm and arctic-wear clothing.The final stop was this book on etiquette that friends were raving about: How Not to Say Yes While Meaning No.They sat in a group with their friends. Pooja, the authority because she had recently returned from a trip to Switzerland, read the excerpts.“A firm handshake plus direct eye contact is the standard form of greeting in Canada. Men should shake hands with women if they offer their hand, but many women will just say ‘hello’ perhaps with a nod of the head, and not shake hands. Personal space is very important. When conversing, people will stand about a half meter apart.”“What does that mean? Should I have a tape measure with me when I meet a Canadian?” asked Vineeta.“No silly,” explained Bharat. “You don’t have to toe the line.” They don’t want you stepping on their corns.”“Ha, ha, ha”, guffawed Peeter. He loved this. He had worked in Brazil. “You know, its so funny. When Latinos and Americans meet formally, they are always dancing.”He explained further. “Its unintentional and it’s called the ‘conversational tango’. When Latinos converse, they tend to stand very close. This makes Americans very uncomfortable and so they back off a step. The Latino follows with a step forward and the visitor sidesteps now. The latino keeps step and the American tries to avoid this. So they move all around the room!”“Enough”, rapped Pooja. “Back to business. Neeru, Shama are you taking notes?”Pooja droned on “to signal that you want your bill or check make a motion with the hands as if you are signing a piece of paper. . .Neeru was half listening and writing down whatever came to her head. It seemed so confusing. What was accepted in one country was not in another. Each country seemed to have developed its own quirky mannerisms. What is accepted in France is a vulgar gesture in another.For instance, kissing the cheek of a woman. A Middle Easterner would not even allow his wife or sister to be introduced to an infidel let alone allow her hand to shaken. Forget kissing her check!V for Victory? : In England Winston Churchill spread his index and middle finger to make the V sign for victory famous. This also signals the number “two” in Bulgaria. However, the symbol V has to be made with palm outward. It is considered an offensive gesture in England if done with your palm facing yourself!She was sure that all this made no sense as she was going there for only a month and if they thought she was being rude or nasty so be it. She was a tourist and foreigners are forgiven most anything. If they didn’t like it they could lump it.However she made these notes in her meticulous handwriting. Just to show how foolish the entire thing was.Sounds of Silence : Americans get uncomfortable with periods of silence. Therefore, in business or social situations, if a gap occurs, an American will quickly try to fill in with conversation. However, in China, silence is respected. So don’t be discouraged if there are long periods of no talk. Chinese use this time to contemplate.What is okay in France and Japan is not okay in China : The circular shape formed by the index and thumb finger with other fingers extended symbolises “okay” in America and France. In Japan it is often interpreted as the symbol for money, as the shape suggests a coin. In Japan if you use this in a store the cashier will give you your change in coins. However, it is interpreted as a vulgar gesture in some parts of the CIS.Don’t scratch if you itch : In Belgium, do not try to yawn, blow your nose, sneeze, or scratch yourself in the presence of others.The snapper : Finger snapping in France is both an offense and a signal. When you snap the fingers of both hands it is offensive. However, you could signal a taxi by snapping your fingers.Way to the loo : In Germany to signal the number “ONE”, hold your thumb upright. Is that how people excuse themselves to go to the loo? Neeru wondered. Weird!The Irish patch : Perhaps the most offensive gesture in Ireland would be to refuse to buy a round of drinks in a pub when it’s your turn to buy. However, in Australia you can signal that you are asking for a fight with anyone in the bar if you finish your drink and turn the glass upside down squarely on the bar.News for the nose : In Netherlands do not rub your nose with your forefinger from the bridge in a downward motion as you are saying the other person is cheap. This is even if your nose is genuinely itchy or you have a runny nose. Secondly do not get up during a meal to go to the bathroom even if you HAVE to. Or any other room for that matter.Tinker tailor : In Egypt, try not to sit with your legs crossed. However, sitting crosslegged tailor-fashion is allowed! It is common to smoke in public and considerate to offer your cigarettes to others present. So carry cartons with you as Egypt has a sizeable population.Not a Good Luck Sign : Lastly ensure that while in Paraguay and exiting Customs, Do Not cross the middle finger over the index finger as Americans do to signal ‘Good luck’. This is considered VERY bad and you will find it brings you ill luck.","keyword":"[\"signal\", \"american\", \"nose\", \"finger\", \"gesture\", \"neeru\"]","ALS":"19.857142857142858"},{"english_id":"233","id":"234","level":"5","topic":"17","title":"Onam — The Harvest Festival","article":"The harvest festival of Kerala, Onam, falls on Shravan day in the month of August or September. After a lush harvest, Onam is the time for the farmers to celebrate the bounties of nature and make merry. Like most festivals of India, Onam too has a legend associated with it.The story goes: A long time ago an Asura king named Mahabali ruled Kerala. He was dearly loved by his subjects and was known to be a just and wise ruler. His popularity soon spread far and wide. Mahabali, however, incurred the wrath of the gods when, besides earth, he extended his rule to the heavens and the nether world. Indra, the king of gods, did not appreciate the growing power of the asura king. The gods approached Lord Vishnu the preserver in the Hindu trinity — to help them out of the situation and to curb the growing power of the asura king. Lord Vishnu in the guise of Vamana (a brahmin dwarf) approached Mahabali for alms. Now Mahabali was a very generous man. He told Vamana to ask for anything. The Vamana asked for three paces of land and the king agreed to it.Immediately the Vamana increased his size, till he grew as big as the universe. And with one step he covered the earth. With the second step he covered the heaven and the nether world. He did not have any land to place the third step. Mahabali, who was a man of principles, offered his head as the third step. And the Vamana placed the third step on Mahabali’s head and sent him to nether world. However before placing the final step, Mahabali was granted a boon. Mahabali was allowed to return to his country once a year and visit his people. And Onam is the day when Mahabali comes to visit his people. In memory of the happy days of Mahabali’s rule, a grateful Kerala celebrates his annual home-coming with all the pomp and grandeur it can command.The glory of those ancient times is recaptured in a popular folk song, which is sung all over Kerala:When Mahabali ruled the landEveryone was equalHappily they livedDanger befell noneThere was no falsehood, or fraudAnd no untruthOnam basically celebrates the mythical king Mahabali, his golden rule and his sacrifice. It welcomes the spirit of King Mahabali and assures him that his people are happy and wish him well.Ten days of feasting, boat races, songs and dance are part of the festivities. Pookalam or floral decoration at the entrance of each house marks each day. Earthen mounds, which look like square pyramids, representing Mahabali and Vishnu are also placed in the dung-plastered courtyards. After traditional prayers and worship, the head of the household presents new clothes to the family and friends. This is followed by a lavish feast.Dancing and sports also takes precedence this week. Certain dances like Kaikotikalli, are traditionally associated with Onam. Caparisoned elephants in spectacular procession, fireworks are also an integral part of the festivities. The Vallamkalli or the boat race is another event that is synonymous with Onam and is best seen at Aranmulla and Kottayam. About 100 oarsmen row huge and graceful snake boats and men and women come from far and near to watch the snake boats skim through the water.This festival is also important because of its secular character. It is celebrated with equal fervour by the Hindus, Muslims and Christians.","keyword":"[\"mahabali\", \"onam\", \"vamana\", \"step\", \"nether\", \"vishnu\"]","ALS":"20.419354838709676"},{"english_id":"234","id":"235","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"Pablo the Pigeon Painter","article":"Pablo Diego Jose Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Maria de los Remedios Cipriano Santisma Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso. Phew! A mouthful, but a name reckoned to be among the greatest artists of the 20th century. His paintings are worth millions and millions have seen and admired his work. A handful is fortunate to own some of his paintings. He’s better known to the world as just Pablo Picasso. To his family he is simply known as – Pablito!Picasso was born on October 25, 1881, in the Spanish town of Malaga. His father, Don Jose Ruiz, was an art teacher. His mother, Dona Maria Picasso, believed Pablo was destined for a glorious future. She thought that if Pablo joined the army he would become a general and if he joined the church he would become the next Pope!Pablo had two younger sisters, Lola and Conchita. Even before he learnt to speak, Pablo discovered that he could get what he wanted by drawing. For instance, he loved churros, the sugarcoated long, twisting fritters that were sold piping hot at stalls all over Spain. The three-year-old would just draw a spiral on a sheet of paper, and watch while his wish was soon granted!But Pablo hated school and all its rules. When Don Jose dropped Pablo at school, the boy would demand that his father should leave behind either his walking stick or his paintbrushes or the pigeon he was drawing – as a pledge that he would return.The young boy often willed himself to fall sick. Soon, he was being tutored at home, as often as his family’s funds permitted. Sometimes, the maid went to school with him, just to hold the pigeon that Pablo wanted to draw.Pablo could not pass his school exams. He would not pay attention to his lessons. Instead he loved it when he was punished, by being sent to a room, where he could then sit and draw to his heart’s desire.Occasionally, he’d signal to his uncle, who lived next door, to come and rescue him from school. Pablo would hold up a finger to signal a ‘one.’ His uncle thought he meant an hour later, so that’s when he turned up at the schoolroom door.All that while, Pablo would restlessly sit on his school bench, looking at the clock on the wall with longing, wondering why it moved so slowly. He was too young to figure out that an hour is a long time in real life.Young Pablo never did childish drawings. His first painting was of the port of Malaga, with its lighthouse. At eight, he did an oil painting of a mounted picador in a bullring because bullfighting is very important to Spanish society. Don Jose, who loved the sport, explained all its mysteries to him.Soon, Don Jose had to shift to a job in Corunna. At ten, Pablo hated numbers in class, but easily translated them into his beloved pigeons. “I’ll show them what I can do,” he resolved. “I won’t miss a single detail…”“The little eye of the pigeon is round like an 0. Under the 0 a 6, under that a 3. The wings are like 2s. The little feet rest on the table, as if on a horizontal line. Underneath it all, the total.” That’s how Pablo coped with math through drawing.In September 1892, Don Jose decided to enrol Pablo – whose genius he recognised by then – in his own art class. Picasso recalls, “My father cut off the feet of a dead pigeon. He pinned them to a board in a proper position, and I copied them in detail until he was satisfied.” Don Jose was so impressed that he even got Pablo to paint the feet of all the pigeons in his own canvases.When little Conchita fell very ill, 13-year-old Pablo pledged never to paint again if his sister could be saved. Unfortunately, she died. That’s when Don Jose handed over his brushes and colours to Pablo, and promised never to paint again himself!Before they left Corunna, Don Jose arranged for an exhibition of Pablo’s art in the back room of a shop that sold curtains, umbrellas and knick-knacks. Not many works were sold, especially when people discovered that the artist was not yet 14! It was Pablo’s first one-man show.It was from these small beginnings that the previous century’s greatest artist, came into being!","keyword":"[\"pablo\", \"jose\", \"pigeon\", \"picasso\", \"painting\", \"ruiz\"]","ALS":"23.75"},{"english_id":"237","id":"238","level":"5","topic":"7","title":"Puppets on a String Dance Again","article":"Vishnudas Bhave’s puppets had to go through a long ordeal before they finally got to the right place and in the hands of the right people. It was not just a long journey but a tough one too.This story dates back to the year 1843, when the father of Marathi theatre, Vishnudas Bhave created his puppets, in Maharashtra’s Sangli district. They were not ordinary wooden puppets. They were so life-like that it seemed they would talk to you any moment. They put life into every play that he put up on stage. ‘Seeta Swayamvar’ became the most well known of his puppet dramas.The puppets were as real for Vishnudas as were humans. His puppets were like children to him, and he took great care of them. But everything changed with his death in 1901. His puppets became orphans. For the next 47 years they lay uncared for in a dark room. One fateful day, in 1948, a fire broke out in the house and burnt more than half of Vishnudas’ treasured puppets. Even this tragedy did not make people take notice of the treasure that lay neglected, says a recent report in ‘The Indian Express’.Puppets on a String Dance Again []It was only about 20 years ago, in the early 1980s, that the puppets were remembered. One individual wanted to bring back to life on stage all of Vishnudas Bhave’s puppets. This man was the Mumbai-based singer-actor, Bhalchandra Pendharkar.But, tragedy struck again when the truck carrying the precious dolls from Sangli to Mumbai suffered a mishap on the outskirts of Mumbai. The puppets lay by the wayside in Girgaum for several months, suffering the onslaught of torrential rains during the monsoon. When it rains in Mumbai, there is so much water on the streets that children can even swim in it, like eager ducks.Totally ruined by the rains, the puppets finally found their way to a workshop in Dadar, Mumbai. The workshop was run by the husband-wife team of Ramdas and Aparna Padhye. From then onward started the rebirth of Vishnudas’ puppets. The Padhyes separated each and every joint of the puppets and re-created them. It took them almost five years to recreate 20 puppets. There was very little written material on how Vishnudas’ arranged his puppet plays.Going by a very short document prepared by Vishnudas himself a long time ago, the Padhyes created a play from a situation in the Mahabharata, ‘Draupadi Swayamvar’. The play was performed in Mumbai last month. It had taken the Padhyes almost 15 years to infuse life into the puppets.This was only the beginning. Padhye also took help from organisations like the Puppeteers of America to get more material on Vishnudas puppets. He also decided to create a special Bhave webpage on his website on puppetry.Not only this, he took Bhave’s puppets to London for a lecture demonstration where the experts were amazed to see such refined work. “They wanted some puppets for sample study. I straightaway refused. I shall not part with this legacy even for one lakh pounds (100,000 pounds)” remarked Padhye.","keyword":"[\"puppet\", \"vishnudas\", \"bhave\", \"mumbai\", \"padhye\", \"padhyes\"]","ALS":"20.75"},{"english_id":"240","id":"241","level":"5","topic":"1","title":"Ride the Camel","article":"The world looks very strange from a camel’s back. On a recent trip to Rajasthan, we travelled on camel back from the city of Jaisalmer to the Sam dhani or sand dunes of the adjoining Thar Desert. We were travelling to Thar, just 42 km away, to watch its dazzling sunsets.Deoram and RajuWhen we set out from Jaisalmer, the desert city famous for its golden fortress, the early evening sun dazzles our eyes. Bright, beige wasteland stretches all around us for miles. Tiny babul shrubs grow by the roadside. There are no villages or huts in sight.A patch of red stirs in the desert far away. Closer up, it proves to be the safa or turban worn by a camel-herder. His name is Deoram. He and his family of Rabaris or camel-herders have lived this way of life for centuries.Soon, we find ourselves trying to stay atop our camel mounts. Their walk is awkward and lurching. To us, it feels like one step backwards to every one forward. It’s quite dizzying to be so far away from the sand beneath our feet.Raju, my mount, has a snout that buzzes with sand flies. He snorts often, but they return to bug him. So, he trots and frets and tosses his head wildly, which makes it even tougher not to take a toss onto the golden desert sands.Deoram, a 28-year-old Rabari with a fierce moustache, clad in a weatherworn white dhoti and kurta, owns Raju.Pirdan, Deoram’s younger brother, is bright-eyed and speaks fluent Hindi, while most Rabaris speak Marwari, the regional language around Jaisalmer. We chat as our caravan of four camels trot along.“I’ve had Raju for 12 years now,” says Deoram. “I bought him at the annual cattle fair at Pushkar near Ajmer. He cost somewhere between Rs. 15,000 to 20,000, I don’t remember exactly…”Living by camelsHow does a Rabari family live around the year? “We live by our camels,” explains Pirdan. “We sometimes hire them out to draw carts. During the tourist season from October to February, we charge Rs. 100 a ride to the dunes. We own four camels, so we make Rs. 400 a day.”But how about summer under the blazing desert sun? “Times are not so good in summer,” adds Pirdan’s burly uncle, who’s riding a camel named Mayuri. “Since we all live together and we aren’t farmers, we have little to eat then, because our land is dry.”“Harrrrrrrrrrrumph”, says Raju, lurching along, as if adding a thought to our talk.Does Raju respond to his name? “Of course,” answers Deoram with affection. “When he’s out grazing and I call his name like this, Rajooooooooo, he stops wherever he is. It’s easy to find him then.”Pirdan, the young groomPirdan has studied more than anyone else in this Rabari family – up to Class X. He’s proud to know so much more about the world.But he’s different from others in Class X in a basic way. Pirdan tells us how: “I got married four years ago, at 16. I was engaged when I was seven. She’s a Rabari, too.”That sounds so strange to our city-wise ears. Does Pirdan find his situation unusual? “It’s part of our tradition,” he responds. “I’m proud to be a Rabari. We even allow widows to marry again.”We think about all we’ve learnt about Rabaris as we weave, sway and stagger towards the horizon. Time doesn’t seem to count to their ageless way of life.More camel facts come into focus as Deoram talks to us. He reveals that the camels from Jaisalmer are known for their speed and can cover over 100 km in a single night. The Rabaris of Rajasthan, we discover, can be either Hindu or Muslim. There are even some among them who are Muslims with Hindu names.Golden sand dunesAt this point, Raju canters over a curve in the horizon. And suddenly, the sand dunes are before us – wave upon wave of golden sand. They are much more beautiful than any geography book or TV programme has ever suggested.In the distance, a procession of camels in brightly embroidered cloth move along. Their riders are just dark blurs to us.Overhead, the sun is still burning bright. It seems to burn the edge of the dunes farthest away. By degrees, the sky turns a brilliant orange, fading into pink, then a misty purple. Even the desert seems to pick up these shades. As we watch, it no longer looks golden brown.Deoram and Raju brought wonderful adventure into our lives, both on and off camelback. We’re already planning a trip back to the sand dunes, perhaps during the three-day desert festival at Jaisalmer from February 6-8, 2001.","keyword":"[\"camel\", \"desert\", \"dune\", \"deoram\", \"rabari\", \"raju\"]","ALS":"19.645833333333332"},{"english_id":"242","id":"243","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"Saraswati River in the Thar Desert","article":"The vedas mention the mighty Saraswati river flowing down the Himalayas and then westwards towards Rajasthan. But Rajasthan is a desert. So where did this huge river, which the vedas say was bigger than the Ganga, disappear?It is widely believed that this river still flows under the Thar desert, though no one has been able to prove this for sure.Even the epic Mahabharata, written in 1000 BC, mentions Saraswati as the once-mighty river that was drying up. As of now, the Saraswati has completely disappeared from the earth’s surface, which is why several people even doubt that it ever existed. For long scientists have been hunting for traces of the Saraswati in the desert.A few years back The Sunday Observer newspaper reported that two scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Dr S M Rao and Dr K M Kulkarni, claimed to have traced the Saraswati in the Thar desert. They have traced the course of the river using satellite images. This is called Landsat imagery.Rao and Kulkarni say that the Saraswati originated from the same source as the Sutlej river, which flows through Punjab. Then it flows through northern Rajasthan, Bhawalpur and Sind in Pakistan till it empties out in the Rann of Kutch. All the time remaining underground.The scientists discovered many underground fresh-water channels and claimed that the water was that of river Saraswati’s. They found a naturally-occurring form of hydrogen, called tritium, in the water. The tritium helped them to establish how old the water was.In channels at Ghantiali, Kuriaberi and Nathurakuan in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan, the water was found to be 8,000 years old, the scientists said. The narrow strip of vegetation along the course of this underground water body, as seen through the satellite, also supports this theory. The presence of the vegetation is remarkable as the surrounding areas continue to be dry.Since the Saraswati is a legendary river, there are several theories about what its original course was. The river has changed its course to the west at least five times. Earlier, a study linked the ancient river to the Ghaggar river that exists today. Some other scholars say that at one time the Sutlej flowed into the Saraswati and then later shifted to westwards to join the Indus river.Some other scholars say that the Indus itself may have been a tributary of the Saraswati at one time. But all these are just theories, no one knows for sure what the Saraswati’s course was.","keyword":"[\"saraswati\", \"river\", \"flow\", \"scientist\", \"rajasthan\", \"theory\"]","ALS":"26.88235294117647"},{"english_id":"248","id":"249","level":"5","topic":"12","title":"The Birth of Christ","article":"Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. Everyone knows that. Do you know the entire story of his birth?Let me narrate it in brief. Over 2000 ago, Roman emperor Caesar Augustus, issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. So everyone went to his or her hometowns to register. A carpenter called Joseph, who was in Nazareth in Galilee in the Middle East (which was also part of the empire), went to nearby Bethlehem. He went there with Mary, who was to be married to him and was expecting a child.While they were there, Mary gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped the baby in clothes and placed him in a manger or stable, because there was no room for them in the town inn.Meanwhile, a few shepherds in the fields nearby were keeping watch over their flocks at night when they were suddenly visited by an angel. The angel informed them that Mary’s baby was in fact Christ the Lord and had been born to be their saviour.So the shepherds, called the Magi, followed a bright star that led them to Bethlehem. They went with gifts and pronounced the baby as the Lord. The baby grew up to be Jesus Christ, founder of Christianity.A typical fairy tale, huh? Like fairy tales, the original Christmas story too is full of divine and miraculous elements: the promise to a virgin that she will have a baby, angelic choirs in the skies announcing the birth and the subsequent arrival of mysterious strangers bearing gifts fit for a king.But unlike fairytales, this one is firmly rooted in the context in which it is set. The story is set in a political context of oppression that is as chillingly familiar in the world today, as it was 20 centuries ago in the country of Judaea, where Joseph and Mary lived. Mary gives birth in a stable because the couple has had to travel from their hometown to Bethlehem, so that they can be registered in the census.The Roman emperor who issued the census order has a vast empire. Tiny Judaea is one of them. The people of Judaea yearn for freedom, and are subjugated not only by the emperor himself, but also by a puppet king whom the emperor has appointed to rule over them.The puppet king, Herod the Great, is a cruel and vengeful tyrant. When Herod hears that the gift-bearing strangers are looking for a new king who has just been born he decides to eliminate the potential rivals by ordering a massacre of all newborn male children. Joseph and his family escape by fleeing to another country and not returning until the tyrant is dead.By depicting the misery of the people under oppressive Roman rule, the story hints that people were in fact ready for something new. That old religions and rulers were suiting them no more. So when the wandering messiah Jesus Christ arrived with his simple and teachings 30 years later, people embraced the teachings wholeheartedly.The divine and miraculous elements in the Christmas story are not just sugar frosting on the crueller elements. They are there as a hope that oppression may be transformed and overcome. One does not have to share the faith of a Christian to derive a few lessons from the story.","keyword":"[\"mary\", \"birth\", \"christ\", \"roman\", \"baby\", \"bethlehem\"]","ALS":"27.636363636363637"},{"english_id":"249","id":"250","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"The Bittersweet Story of Chocolate","article":"Many, many centuries ago, sometime around 400 BC, in the jungles of South andCentral America, the Cacao plant was discovered which in the ages to come would become the most desired foodstuff in the whole world.The plant was found to have hard pods with each pod containing brown beans that later became the main ingredient in the making of chocolate. Cacao was a very important plant even then as it was actually used as money by the Mayans and later by the Aztecs.Cacao made its way into Europe when Columbus returned to Spain and displayed a treasure trove of many strange and wonderful things from his travels before King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. Among these were a few dark brown beans that looked like almonds and seemed most unpromising. These were the cacao beans, the source of all chocolate and cocoa.The King and Queen never dreamed how important these cacao beans could be. It remained for Hernan Cortez, the great Spanish explorer, to popularize this drink commercially.During his conquest of Mexico, Cortez found the Aztec Indians serving a drink made of these beans to Montezuma, the Aztec ruler. This drink was called “chocolatl” by the Indians, meaning warm liquid. In 1519, Montezuma served this drink chocolatl to his Spanish guests in great golden goblets, treating it like a food for the gods.For all its regal importance, however, Montezuma’s chocolatl was very bitter, and the Spaniards did not like its bitterness. To make the mixture more agreeable, Cortez sweetened it with sugarcane.When they took this drink back to Spain, the idea found favour and the drink underwent several more changes with newly discovered spices, such as cinnamon and vanilla. Ultimately, someone decided the drink would taste better if served hot.The new drink soon won favour, especially among the Spanish aristocracy. Spain proceeded to plant cacao in its overseas colonies, which gave birth to a very profitable business. Remarkably enough, the Spanish succeeded in keeping the art of the cocoa industry a secret from the rest of Europe for nearly a hundred years.Spanish monks, who had been consigned to process the cacao beans, finally let the secret out. It did not take long before chocolate was acclaimed throughout Europe as a delicious, health-giving food.Drinking chocolate or what was called cocoa, was made possible with the invention of the cocoa press. The press helped to improve the quality of the beverage by squeezing out part of the cocoa butter, the fat that occurs naturally in these beans. From then on, drinking chocolate had more of the smooth consistency and the pleasing aroma it has today.The 19th century marked two more revolutionary developments in the history of chocolate. In 1847, an English company called Fry and Sons introduced solid “eating chocolate” through the development of fondant chocolate. This was a smooth and velvety variety that has almost completely replaced the old coarse-grained chocolate that formerly dominated the world market.The second development occurred in 1875 in Vevey, Switzerland, when Daniel Peter devised a way of adding milk to the chocolate, creating the product we enjoy today known as milk chocolate.Make your own chocolate fudgeA popular delicacy, chocolate fudge is the easiest thing to make.Mix one spoon of chocolate powder, two cups of castor sugar, one cup of white butter, 3\/4th cup milk, and a few drops of vanilla essence.Boil it until the mixture thickens. Then, remove it from fire and beat with a wooden spoon until it is nearly cold. It should be very creamy when done.Next, pour the material on to a buttered plate or tin and allow it to set. Your chocolate fudge is now ready to be cut and eaten.","keyword":"[\"chocolate\", \"cacao\", \"bean\", \"drink\", \"cocoa\", \"spanish\"]","ALS":"35.36842105263158"},{"english_id":"251","id":"252","level":"5","topic":"18","title":"The Boy who Lacked Sight but Had a Vision","article":"It was like any other day in school for six-year-old George Abraham. He went to La Martinere school in Lucknow, where he lived with his aunt. The school was open to boys till the fourth standard.That day, as usual, the teacher found that the little boy was holding the book next to his nose. She complained and George had to undergo several eye tests. The doctors found that his retina was damaged beyond repair, and said he would lose most of his eyesight.George’s parents, who lived in Hubli, Karnataka, came to Lucknow to take him back with them. His father was an engineer with the government and was posted to remote places. That was in 1964.Thirty-four years later, in 1998, came his greatest moment of triumph. George Abraham, had successfully organised the World Cup Cricket for the Blind, in Delhi. Teams from New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan, England, Sri Lanka, South Africa and India participated in it. In 1999, Wisden, which is like the Bible of cricketers, mentioned his contribution to the sport. Cricketers like Steve Waugh and Sachin Tendulkar supported his cause, in television advertisements. The President of India gave away the trophy to the winning team.For the players it was sport as usual. And once the spectators had got used to the special rules like underarm bowling, it was a competitive game like any other. The cricket ball has ball bearings inside and thus makes a sound, enabling the players to bat, field and catch.George became known as the man who used the game of cricket to encourage a competitive spirit and confidence among the blind. He is the man who singlehandedly put cricket for the blind on the world map, literally. Since 1990, he has successfully organised cricket championships for the blind at the school level, and at the state level.His list of achievements is large. In 1996, he was one of the five Indians chosen to carry the relay torch at the Atlanta Olympics. Today, he conducts communication workshops for high-level executives in companies like WIPRO Infotech, among others. And for the past two years, he has been holding workshops for blind youth all over the country. His message to them is that they should try to be achievers in some field or the other. They should reject any gesture of charity. In 1993, he received the Sanskriti award. It was to recognise that he has the potential to do even greater things.If you ask him how he did all this, he mentions the five Ds: dream, desire to fulfil the dream, discipline, determination and dedication. But all this did not happen in one day.To learn about how it happened, it is necessary to go back to his childhood. Though the doctors had advised the boy’s parents to put him in a blind school, they chose to put him in a ‘normal’ school, the Kendriya Vidyalaya.That was the best thing they could have done. For, after making fun of him initially, George’s classmates realised that he was not only just like them, he was better at studies and sports than them. More importantly, he was willing to guide them. From then on, they read to George and he explained. It was a perfect give and take arrangement. That was the beginning of George’s journey to excellenceThe Boy who Lacked Sight but Had a VisionA star student throughout school and at the prestigious St Stephen’s College, George excelled in studies, music, debates as well as in state-level athletics. He feels that it was his mother’s confidence in his abilities that helped him come so far.But, he entered the darkest phase of his life after he finished college in 1980. His mother’s death left him shaken. For the first time, he felt that his lack of vision was a handicap in getting jobs. He was back in Kerala with his father, and depressed.Then, one day, at 4 am, he realised something: that he was the only one who could help himself. Borrowing Rs. 500 from his father, he came to Delhi, stayed with a friend in his hostel room and started looking for jobs in advertising. Having somehow got an appointment with the chairman of a big company, Advertising and Sales Promotion, George impressed him with his sheer confidence. The job was his! In 1984, he shifted to the advertising giant, Ogilvy and Mather, as copywriter.The turning point came in 1988. George was 29 years of age. He went to a blind school for the first time. He was horrified to see how blind young people with lesser handicaps than him had no confidence at all. For two years, he travelled on a grant provided by a non-governmental organisation to decide what he wanted to do.One day, he saw some blind children playing cricket in Dehradun. The ball had ball bearings inside. The competitive spirit was tremendous. That’s when he decided to use cricket to boost the competitive levels among the blind. It was also a way of telling the world to treat the blind as people with the potential to achieve anything. Like normal people.It is not surprising that Discovery Channel should have picked him as one of the Discovery people from India.“There is a lot of truth in the saying that when you give you receive in multiples of what you give,” says George. When he was 10, his mother once said that she believed he would write his autobiography. It was her confidence in him that has taken him this far, says George. And he is ready to travel further.(In the special articles under the Parenting section, you can find a thought-provoking article by George Abraham, on whether the blind constitute a liability or a potential resource to any society, and especially Indian society.)","keyword":"[\"blind\", \"cricket\", \"george\", \"confidence\", \"competitive\", \"advertising\"]","ALS":"21.21153846153846"},{"english_id":"252","id":"253","level":"5","topic":"18","title":"The Cure is Laughter","article":"It is not a new way of spreading happiness. The method has been practised for a while and has also been captured on celluloid by Hollywood in the film ‘Patch Adams’. In the film (based on a true story) Patch Adams is the name of a studentof medicine, who decides to use humour to help patients. The role was played by Robin Williams, Hollywood’s leading comedian.This technique has been adopted in Brazil, to great success. Members of the ‘Group of Frolic’ (Turma da Pholia) regularly visit hospitals to cheer patients in Rio de Janeiro. Their clowning around helps in the treatment, say doctors. While their methods might be somewhat unusual, a sound principle governs them: a good state of mind can increase the immunity of a patient and speed up recovery.The Cure is LaughterBut how do they bring about a good state of mind? By bringing theatre, music and poetry to people in hospitals, orphanages and asylums. “The reception we have been getting is wonderful. The reward for bringing a smile to the face of a child is well worth the effort that we put in,” says Micheli Bento Cortermani, a 16-year-old member of the group.The ‘Group of Frolic’ was founded in São Paulo two years ago. The group consists of 25 actors, clowns and musicians, between 16 and 30 years of age.“I have not done any scientific research on the subject but aftermembers of the group have visited the hospital, the patients acceptthe treatment more easily,” says a doctor.Some research on the subject has been done, though. Doctor SebastiãoCarlos Silva Jr, is a neurosurgeon (brain surgeon) at the Clinic of Happiness of theSchool of Medicine of São José do Rio Preto. He has writtenan entire article on various ways to handle pain.Members of bodies like the Clinic of Happiness, through their visits, try and forge close links with patients suffering from chronic pain. They do so by showing the patients how to breathe properly, and encouraging them to visualize and relax through the performances.These activities act on the emotions and imagination of those who are suffering. The connection thus formed between the body and the mind helps in reducing pain, says Carlos. For it’s known that the feeling that one is in pain is morewhen the person is scared, or sad, or lonely, or is suffering from a lack of sleep.The patients look forward to regular visits by members of the group(they visit at the same time every day) help in breaking monotony.“It is nice to have the same group of people coming regularlybecause patients, especially children, look forward to thesevisits,” says he.Members of the Clinic of Happiness go to five hospitals on a regular basis and collect money for work through the sale of postcards and T-shirts on street corners. They are thoroughly trained for the job, even not to be depressed while dealing with seriously-ill patients.In the city of São Paulo, another group called Doctor of Happiness (Doutores daAlegria) is also following the same technique to make patients happy. It does not work with volunteers though. Members of this group too visit hospitals at the same time on specific days of the week. They create a strong bond of friendship and trust with the patients.These groups are yet another testimony to the time-tested saying, that laughter can be the best medicine.","keyword":"[\"patient\", \"hospital\", \"happiness\", \"clinic\", \"visit\", \"medicine\"]","ALS":"31.6"},{"english_id":"253","id":"254","level":"5","topic":"12","title":"The Day Christ Died","article":"As a child, I did not know the significance of Good Friday for Christians. For me, all it meant was a day off from school. One evening, I let it slip to a friend that I thought ‘Good’ Friday meant something good must have happened on this day.My friend Lorraine stared at me in astonishment. Then she told me that Good Friday is actually a day of mourning as Christ was crucified on that day.“Then what’s good about it?” I asked. She told me that Christ’s death symbolises the victory of good over evil, hence the ‘Good’. But I was more confused than ever, so she explained it to me.The Crucifixion of Christ is known as ‘Good’ Friday in the English language. Good Friday was originally God’s Friday just as good-bye was originally God be with ye. Over the years, it has evolved into Good Friday and good-bye respectively. The other reason why it is ‘Good’, is that on this day the Son of God sacrificed his life for the people.What were those times like? The vast Roman empire which ruled over ancient Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, was also reigning over Judea, Sameria and Palestine. Christ was born at a time when the Roman empire had become too vast and unwieldy. The people, especially in the outposts, were rebelling against its dominance.The Romans believed in many gods and even the divinity of the Roman emperor. There were those who resented this, like the Jews. Unrest marked many of the regions that came under the rule of the Romans, as a result.Jesus Christ’s ideas and teachings were aimed at reforming the Jewish faith, to which the people of Israel belonged. The man who was a carpenter by trade and had disciples from equally humble professions, gave the common people a sense of belonging. His message of equality gave them self respect.Some high officials and Jewish priests however, felt that he was trying to usurp their authority and mislead the people. They hatched a plot against Jesus with the help of one of his 12 apostles (leading disciples), named Judas.The Jewish authorities arrested Jesus for claiming to be the Son of God, as such a claim was against their religious teachings. Thereafter, Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor, Pilate, as only he could condemn anyone to death.Stained glass window depicting Jesus on the cross in the cathedral of Brussels. jorisvo \/ Shutterstock.comThe Jewish leaders told Pilate that Jesus was misleading the people, telling them not to pay taxes to the emperor, and claiming to be the Son of God. However, Pilate saw no reason to condemn him. But the priests argued that anyone claiming to be the King of Jews was a threat to the Roman empire and should be put to death.After questioning Jesus, the Governor still did not find him guilty, but to please the priests, he said he would have Jesus flogged and released. Jesus was made to wear a crown of thorns and mockingly addressed as ‘King of the Jews’.But the priests were not pleased. Once again, the Governor appealed to them saying that Christ had done no wrong. But when the clergy refused to agree, Pilate handed Jesus Christ to them to do as they wished. The high priests told him, “Let his blood be upon us and upon our children.”The crowd too demanded that Jesus should be crucified.Jesus was made to carry the heavy wooden cross on which he was to be nailed, while a group of his followers marched behind him. Jesus died in three hours and his followers buried him in a cave. It is believed that Jesus rose from his grave on the third day, which was a Sunday. That day is celebrated as Easter.Jesus’ death on the cross was followed by a round of persecution for the followers of Christ. The Roman authorities feared that this new religion would take strong root among the people and encourage them to protest against their rule. But in a few centuries, the Romans themselves had embraced Christianity.On Good Friday, the Christians recall the pain that Christ had to go through and observe a fast for the whole day.A wooden cross, representing the cross on which Christ was crucified, is displayed and worshipped during the religious service on Good Friday.

And millions of Indians went to sleep in a state of excitement. For, they would literally wake up in a free country. Among them was a five-year-old girl called Amrita Rangasami. She lived with four siblings and a young widowed mother, in a bylane of Madras (now Chennai).Sixty-year-old Amrita, a senior journalist and scholar, remembers the day clearly, as if it were yesterday.As the red letter day dawned, her mother put up the Indian tricolour atop their house. “All of us sat down with folded hands in absolute silence for two minutes, offering a tribute to all those who had laid down their lives and suffered in making our dreams come true,” says Amrita.Her mother had made kheer. “It was a grand meal just like it would be on any major festival,” remembers Amrita. All her school friends came home and tucked into the special meal.As they made their way to school, the streets were full of people saying ‘Jai Hind’ to each other. There were children everywhere. Everyone in the school bus, including the driver, conductor and children, had a smile that stretched from ear to ear. When they saw a truck filled with English soldiers they decided they could be rude that day, and so they all called them ‘white monkeys’.Houses and shops were lit up even during daytime. The people had gone absolutely mad with joy. “That joy on everyone’s face is the greatest memory of my childhood,” says Amrita. It was like a dream come true. Nobody could believe that they had finally got independence from British rule.The best part of it all was the fact that Governor Hope, a white man, was going to hoist the Indian flag in their school!As a small child Amrita recalls her mother’s strong belief in Gandhi’s ideas. “My mother was an active participant of the All India Women’s Conference, an organisation that was led by famous women freedom fighters who motivated women across the country to join the freedom movement. Her mother, too, started wearing khadi sarees in place of silk.“Every night before going to bed, mother used to make all of us sit with folded hands and silently pray for the health and well-being of the leaders who were in jail,” she recalls.“Right fom the childhood we followed Gandhiji’s philosophy of ‘White man quit India’,” says Amrita. As children they had mixed feelings about their white teachers as well. They respected them greatly as individuals and teachers, but also experienced anti-colonial feelings when they saw them.On growing up, Amrita went for further studies to the United States of America and returned to doing journalism and then branch into academic research as well. She is one of the foremost experts in what is called famine studies, in India today. Fifty four years after Independence, she is still uncovering the reasons behind the frequent droughts and famines that impoverish more and more people in rural India.The five-year-old in her is still alive today, searching for the causes that prevent a majority of Indians from getting freedom from hunger and poverty.","keyword":"[\"amrita\", \"mother\", \"flag\", \"freedom\", \"folded\", \"white\"]","ALS":"29.285714285714285"},{"english_id":"258","id":"259","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"The Filmmaker","article":"Shooting ‘Shores of Silence’, was probably more exciting than shooting a high-voltage action thriller for Mike Pandey and his two crewmembers. The small fishing boat that they rode the high seas in, was tossed by huge waves like a cork, threatening their life and equipment several times. But the three hung on, determined to shoot the sequence that was to be the highlight of the film – the capturing and slaughtering of giant whale sharks.“We had no state-of-the art equipment. Not even high-resolution lenses that take long-distance shots. So, our only alternative was to move dangerously close to the creatures (about 20-30 feet away) and take some good quality shots”, says Mike, explaining the reason behind their adventurous move.But the efforts paid off. Mike’s film, the first Indian film to document the mindless massacre of these gentle creatures of the sea, won the world’s most prestigious award for ‘green’ films, at Bristol. Mike won the Wildscreen Panda Award, also known as the Green Oscars, reports ‘The Hindustan Times’.Mike had won the award once earlier. He won it for a 1994 film titled ‘The Last Migration – Wild Elephant Capture at Sarjuga’. It was the first Asian film to win a Wildscreen Panda.‘Shores of Silence’ is a 25-minute docudrama that took three agonizing years to complete. It was made on a shoestring budget of US$ 50,000 as compared to half a million to a million dollars that a foreign crew would spend. It was pitted against 478 mega-budget entries that had been entered by the likes of the British Broadcasting Corporation, National Geographic and Discovery.But the jury, instead of getting carried away by the superior technology of the other films, decided to award Mark’s film for the sensitive way in which it tackles the tragedy of the whale sharks, which are being hunted down for their blubber, oil and skin.Mark’s interest in wildlife began as a child in Nairobi, Kenya. This African country is known for its scenic beauty and abundant wildlife. The house he lived in, was located in the backyard of Nairobi’s famous National Park. He remembers going out on long walks with his father and brother, and being awed by the magnificence of the country and its fresh natural beauty.So when he received his first Kodak camera as a gift, Mike was as delighted as a little boy with his new toy. He could now capture the fascinating surroundings around him on film, with his camera.His childhood love proved enduring for this unusual man who, took his first name (Mike) from a character he played as a schoolboy, a detective called Michael Hammer.Mike went on to learn film direction and cinematography, at the London School of Films. He came back to India in 1970, where he founded Riverbank Studios. His other films include ‘Honey Hunters of the Blue Mountains’ and ‘The Living Fossil: Indian Horseshoe Crab’– poetic names thought up by someone who could see the inner beauty of nature. “I sense a harmony, a symmetry in nature, even in a blade of grass. That’s why I feel outraged when I see man entering into a conflict with it,” he says.Conviction and not profit lies at the root of Mike’s work. He has already pledged forty per cent of the proceeds from the sale of his film, to ‘Earth Matters Foundation’, a non-profit organisation that deals with environmental issues. The Foundation’s current campaign is to seek a ban on the slaughter of whale sharks. The foundation does provide alternatives to fishermen whose livelihood depends on the slaughter of these whale sharks and sale of products derived from it.","keyword":"[\"film\", \"mike\", \"whale\", \"award\", \"shark\", \"foundation\"]","ALS":"31.772727272727273"},{"english_id":"263","id":"264","level":"5","topic":"2","title":"The Joy of Flying","article":"Come Independence Day and the markets are flooded with kites. The sky looks like an ocean swarming with tiny tadpoles swimming across from one place to the other. Colourful tadpoles, though!Although kite flying has been popular in India for hundreds of years, historians believe that kite flying originated in China almost 3,000 years ago. There are many stories, which talk about the origin of kites.There was a king in China who asked his army men to tie him to a kite and fly him off to the enemy’s territory. The moment he reached above enemy territory, he shouted out that if anyone came out of their palace they would be killed.Hearing this “voice from above” all the soldiers ran away and there was no one to fight the next day. Many other myths exist but that’s not surprising since people in nearly half the countries on this earth fly kites.The earliest kites were made from bamboo and silk. Now they are made with thin paper, plastic, cotton, silk and many other materials. Various kite-flying organisations all over the world organise festivals to create a strong kite flying community.The most recent festival was held in Indonesia last month wherein teams from Japan, China and Thailand participated.In India, one can get kites throughout the year but there are certain months when kite flying is especially popular. For example, in August, during the festivals of Raksha-Bandhan and Teej, and in January on Makar Sankranti, they are sold in large numbers.Makar Sankranti marks the end of a long winter, a time when the earth enters the constellation of Makara or Capricorn. It is one of the most popular days for kite enthusiasts in India.The famous Desert Kite Festival at Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur (Rajasthan) is held between January 11 and 14, to coincide with Makar Sankranti. Teams from all over the world come together for kite making, kite flying, and kite fighting competitions.As children and adults in terraces of houses shout encouragingly “Woh Kata!”, the kites take centrestage. A wide variety of kites can be seen in the sky. From simple diamond shaped kites to designer ones, they all try to soar to unimaginable heights.While the kites of Rampur, Lucknow and Moradabad in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh are said to be the best, manjha, the thread used to fly the kite, is usually made in another city of Uttar Pradesh, namely Bareilly. Manjha is made by coating the thread with glass powder to make it sharp.But true artistry lies in making kites. Khan Saheb who makes kites as a part of his traditional family business, and shuttles between Rampur and Delhi, says “Din mein hum 50-60 saadi patange bana lete hain ya phir 4-5 janwar wali.” (In a day we make 50-60 plain kites or about four to six designer ones with animal patterns.) Usually designer kites are made to order, as they are more expensive.But for the child on a terrace, armed with a simple diamond-shaped kite, a spool of thread and a bit of precious sharp manjha, kite flying is one of the cheapest ways to have a day full of excitement. On a good day, a little champ could bring in a few free kites after hectic battles in the sky. On a bad day, it is time to chase any fallen kite that hasn’t been claimed yet. Either way, the fun never ends.","keyword":"[\"kite\", \"sankranti\", \"designer\", \"manjha\", \"festival\", \"tadpole\"]","ALS":"31.95"},{"english_id":"266","id":"267","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"The Language of a Cat","article":"The poet Carl Sandburg wrote, “The fog comes in on little cat feet.” So do a large number of our words and expressions. Let’s think of the cats that run and leap and pounce and slink and purr and meow through the English language.There are a number of explanations for the phrase, “it’s raining cats and dogs”? Cats and dogs were closely associated with the rain and wind in the western mythology. Dogs were often pictured as the attendants of Odin, the storm god, and cats were believed to cause rain.But the true source appears to be quite literal. During heavy rains in the 17th century England some city streets became raging rivers of filth carrying many drowned cats and dogs.Not long ago in England, a city dweller had to be careful of buying a pig from a villager who would keep it in a sack. Very often, cunning villagers intent on duping the customer substituted the pigs with cats. And when the city dweller opened the bag, he would literally let the cat out of the bag, revealing the crafty farmer’s secret.When a cat is attacked by a dog or other animals, it aggressively arches its back, a response that suggested the phrase ‘to get one’s back up’ to describe humans aroused to anger.On the other paw, cats are often pictured as grinning. Charles Ludwidge Dodgson, best known to the world as Lewis Carroll, popularised the Cheshire cat in his classic, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). In the story, the Cheshire cat in the story gradually fades from Alice’s view, but the smile manages to hang in the air magically.An old British expression advised that “There’s more than one way of killing a cat than choking it with cream.” The expression was used to describe a foolish action since cats like cream and would never choke to death on it. Gradually, this expression gave way to yet another colourful one – there’s more than one way to skin a cat.The Language of a CatCats have long been regarded as tenacious survivors because of their careful, suspicious nature and because they are supple animals that can survive high falls. This could be the reason for the Old English saying that a cat has nine lives. This phrase can be traced back well before the 16th century.You might have asked a person who has been rendered speechless if a cat has got her tongue. This phrase refers to a form of punishment in the Mid-east, several centuries ago, when the tongue of a person who lied was cut off and fed to the ruling king’s pets, often cats.Here’s one that bothered me for years. Which cat was killed by curiosity? What was it curious about and how did it meet its end?Actually, this is a case of a phrase that has changed over the years. The original saying was ‘care kills a cat,’ meaning that cats seemed to be very cautious and careful.Then came another human twist to the ‘tail’ that cats were nervous creatures and nervousness as we all know, leads to eventual death. So, over the years the definition of the word ‘care’ changed and, eventually, the word care in the phrase was replaced with curiousity.Catcall is an easy one. It dates back to the theatre in Shakespeare’s age. Instead of booing, the gentlemen made noises that sounded like an auditorium full of cats.All these phrases are still very much in use, along with modern-day phrases. Remember the girl in the previous class, who used to be quite a ‘cat’? Being a cat or cool cat implies that the person is smart or street smart – like a cat.If you knew the origin of all these cat phrases then you are truly the cat’s whiskers.","keyword":"[\"phrase\", \"expression\", \"rain\", \"kill\", \"dweller\", \"cheshire\"]","ALS":"34.333333333333336"},{"english_id":"268","id":"269","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"The Silken Web","article":"While working on a machine in a sericulture unit in Karnataka, a little girl was severely injured in the head. Sericulture is the art of raising silkworms to obtain raw silk. The incident ocurred in the Ramanagaram-Channapatna taluk (a group of villages make a taluk) of Karnataka, where there are many such units.The little girl is one of hundreds of thousands of children employed in the sericulture industry in the state. Owners of sericulture units prefer children over adults for the work.The traumatised life of these children is the subject of a documentary film,Inde Baalya or Childhood Now, in Kannada and English. A Mangalore-based film-maker, Natesh Ullal, and his wife Vidya Dinker, have made the film, said a report in The Hindu.The documentary is based on a study carried out by MAYA (Movement for Alternatives and Youth Awareness). MAYA is a non-governmental organisation working on issues that affect children and youth.A sericulture unit is extremely cramped as there is very little space to work in. Imagine a narrow matchbox-like space. That and the low height of the bobbin, the cylinder or spindle on which the thread is wound, makes it difficult for a grown-up person to work.Women working on weaving machine using silkworm cocoons in a silk factory. Elena Mirage \/ Shutterstock.comThe child worker is made to stand with her back to the wall with the machine in front of her. She is almost trapped under the machinery, as if she were standing in a narrow cage. Now you know why owners of such units prefer children to work on the machine.The reeler, the person who turns the wheel, throws cocoons to her every now and then. The child creates silk from the cocoon.There’s another reason why children are hired in the sericulture industry. Child labour is far cheaper than adult labour. And sericulture requires a lot of work to be done by hands and much less by machine.Children work as turners, pupae pickers, helpers and even cocoon cooks in these units. The common illnesses among them are asthma, fungal infection, malnutrition and anaemia.The most challenging task for Ullal and his team was to film the children working in the most awful conditions.They knew that if the mill owners came to know the real purpose of their work, they’d never allow them to film it. So, the team pretended to be interested only in the process of producing the silk. That way, they could enter the premises and still film the work that little children were made to do, and also how they were made to do it.While camerapersons operated the camera, Ullal and Dinker spoke continuously to the mill owner in order to divert his attention.","keyword":"[\"sericulture\", \"unit\", \"film\", \"owner\", \"ullal\", \"cocoon\"]","ALS":"29.11764705882353"},{"english_id":"269","id":"270","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"The Stockholm Effect","article":"Sweden lies in the Scandinavian Peninsula in northern Europe, with Norway to the west and Finland to the northeast. Stockholm, its permanent capital since 1523, is located at the junction of Lake Mälar (Mälaren) and Salt Bay (Saltsjön), an arm of the Baltic Sea, opposite the Gulf of Finland. Due to its location, built as it is upon numerous islands, Stockholm is regarded as one of the most beautiful capital cities in the world.The Swedish capital, Stockholm, has puzzled people for ages. Its folks once thought of it as Europe’s largest small town. But over the past 15 years, it has grown to be the continent’s smallest large city, with a population of about 1.6 million people.Stockholm is built at the point where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea. Its 14 islands are connected by 53 bridges.The best way to see the city is on a tourist boat. As the boat speeds over the sun-spotted waters, we notice that boats of every imaginable shape and size bob in waters in front of the gabled buildings that sit comfortably along the island edges.The city tour takes you to the spot where former Swedish Premier Olof Palme was gunned down and a glimpse of the royal family’s summer residence. You can glimpse the long queues of people waiting to go into the Riksdag or the Swedish Parliament. Though Sweden has been ruled by King Carl Gustav XVI since 1973, its democracy functions well. Today, Sweden’s elected government has more women than men, and equal numbers of men and women hold seats in its Riksdag.Stockholm, in many ways, is typical of Sweden. When we think of Sweden, so many images float into our minds – the image of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, who also instituted the annual Nobel Prizes in various fields; or the pop group ABBA, which topped the pop charts for months in the 1970s; or the Pippi Longstocking books by Astrid Lindgren, about a nine-year-old girl who has wild adventures with a horse and a monkey for company; or Bjorn Borg, the great tennis star of the modern era, who won five straight Wimbledon titles.Most Swedes have a wonderful sense of humour. They laugh when foreigners confuse their country with Switzerland. Or when people lump all of Scandinavia – Denmark, Norway and Sweden – into a single country.Of course, Sweden does share many traditions with Denmark and Norway. Take Christmas in Stockholm. Christmas in the Nordic countries (as the Scandinavian countries are called) includes a rice pudding called julgrot, which has an almond in it. Whoever gets the almond is said to have good luck all year long. The Christmas meal normally includes other typical Swedish dishes such as meatballs and pickled herring.In Sweden, Christmas begins on St. Lucia’s day or December 13, when the oldest daughter of the family – dressed in white with a wreath on her head, bearing seven lighted candles – serves each person coffee and buns in bed. Swedish children believe that a bright elf named jultomten brings them gifts from Santa on Christmas Eve.Though Sweden is one of the largest countries in Europe, pine forests amidst beautiful lakes and snow-capped mountains cover 90 percent of its land. Only 10 percent is populated and farmed. Visitors can picnic on pretty stretches of land, as long as they don’t disturb those living there or litter the place.In Stockholm, it’s easy to see that Swedes are among the richest people in Europe. They have more cars, cell phones and TV sets per head than other Europeans. Education in Sweden is free. Old people, widows and orphans are looked after by the government, and most medical services are free. When a baby is born in Sweden, the State pays its parents a large portion of their salaries so that they are able to stay at home for the first 15 months of its life.But to return to Stockholm, which became the capital in 1523. It was probably founded in the early 1250s by a Swedish leader named Birger Jarl. He built a castle in the area that is now Gamla Stan or the old town, the heart of the city.The Gamla Stan, with its cobbled streets, is beautiful by the light of ancient lamps at night. We found tall, blonde-haired Swedes walking and joking along the waterfront by moonlight, or chatting on the wrought iron benches in its squares. All around them are drinking houses or pubs, where Swedes shout ‘Skol!’ as they raise their wine glasses.Though Bangladeshis today sell postcards with Trolls and Pakistanis hawk T-shirts with Vikings on them in the heart of Stockholm’s broad avenues, the essence of the city remains Swedish. Swedes still stride past the old buildings and new skyscrapers daily, greeting friends in the streets with “Hei!”That’s the word to watch for as a visitor in Stockholm. It’s the easiest way to make friends in the Swedish capital.","keyword":"[\"sweden\", \"stockholm\", \"swedish\", \"swede\", \"christmas\", \"norway\"]","ALS":"31"},{"english_id":"270","id":"271","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"The Story of Indian Bronzes","article":"One of the most beautiful figures in Indian sculpture is that of Lord Shiva dancing the Ananda Tandava or dance of joy, one leg raised high, his face very calm, as he destroys all life until new life is born once more. Looking at the divine dancer, we can almost hear the sound of the damru or small drum that he holds in one fist.The bronze figure of this god is often seen in museums, in homes, even at crafts bazaars. So are crafted figures of Shiva and Parvati, Buddhist saints, or even Rama, Sita and Lakshman.But is there a story behind Indian bronze sculptures? The earliest in India was probably the metal figure of the dancing girl found at Mohenjo-Daro. Remember it from the history textbooks?As ages passed by, the history of Indian bronzes came to be linked with the south. The art of creating the bronzes flourished in the Southern kingdoms of the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, the Cholas of Thanjavur, the Pandyas of Madurai and the Vijayanagar rulers.Though often referred to as ‘bronzes,’ these statues seldom use the alloy of copper and tin that makes up bronze because tin was not said to be pure enough for statues of the gods and goddesses. Usually, pure copper or brass (an alloy of copper and zinc) was used for metal casting. Later, the mix of the alloy changed to 20 parts of copper, to one of brass and one of white lead.Who were the people who made these statues? And how did they do it?In ancient India, the sthapati or metalworker was honoured by kings and commoners alike. His skills were often revered as a gift from the gods, even finding a mention in the Yajur Veda.The sthapati usually cast his bronzes through the cire perdue, which is the French term for the ‘lost wax’ process. He first modelled a simple figure in wax, including details of the body. Next, a special clay mixture, including rice husks and cow dung, was applied over the wax in thicker and thicker layers. The clay form had openings at the top and the bottom.What were the openings for? The clay model was heated, so that the wax drained out from the bottom. While this happened, liquid metal alloy was poured into the model from the top, filling each nook and cranny of it. Later, the clay coating was broken, and the metal cast taken out. At this stage, it’s still not quite perfect. So, the sthapati has to chisel it by hand with simple tools. Last of all, the figure is polished or burnished to give it the sheen that we look for in bronzes.Strangely, the bronze-casters at centres like Swamimalai and Salem in Tamil Nadu today still use methods similar to those of the ancient Indian sthapatis, probably even as far back as Mohenjo-Daro.Dr. R Nagaswami, a former Director of Archaeology in Tamil Nadu, shared some fascinating stories about ancient bronzes with us.“A sthapati would first make a wax model, and take it out in a procession through the main street of his village or town,” Dr. Nagaswami reveals. “Only after the local people had approved of it could he cast it in bronze. He wouldn’t allow people to watch as he worked on figures of gods or goddesses, fearing it might bring him ill luck.”“If the sthapati did a fine bronze, the king would reward him with land and money,” he adds. “The king made sure that the best sthapatis never lacked the money or the leisure to create beautiful works. The creators read poetry, watched dancers, and even listened to classical music. It was essential to know these in order to create superb bronzes.”Do we know the names of these sthapatis? “We don’t have the name of even one bronze sculptor,” Dr. Nagaswami replies. “These idols were made for worship, so they didn’t write on them. But we do have the names of donors inscribed, even on a 915 A.D. image of Parvati. And yet, the name of the architect of the great temple at Thanjavur was found inscribed within it!”Did the sthapati always work alone? “In ancient times, the craft was handed down from father to son or other relatives. It was usually kept within the family,” he tells us. “We don’t know if more than one person worked on a bronze. That’s why, even today, historians still don’t refer to each bronze caster by name. Instead, they just call them the Kumbakonam school or the Tanjore school.”Each bronze holds within itself so many secrets and stories. Will we think about these nameless sthapatis the next time we come face to face with a beautiful Indian bronze figure?India Feature Service","keyword":"[\"bronze\", \"sthapati\", \"figure\", \"sthapatis\", \"alloy\", \"copper\"]","ALS":"26.114285714285714"},{"english_id":"271","id":"272","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"The Story-tellers","article":"What could be a better way to get to know a country than through its folk-tales and stories? And if you love collecting stories anyway, as Madhu Gurung does, nothing could be more wonderful. Here, Madhu, presently based in Myanmar’s capital, Yangon, talks about the Myanmarese duo of mother and daughter who have enlivened her days by weaving tales even as they help her with her domestic chores. Madhu shares the magic of those story-telling sessions in the following anecdote:Fatima is 56 years old. Like the rest of her brood I too, lovingly call her Amma or mother. The other is Amma’s 26-year old daughter, Praveena. She is the main storyteller.The Story-tellers [Illustrated by Sudheer Nath]Praveena tells stories she has heard and read as a child. She tells them in Hindi. She has acquired a limited vocabulary, having worked in Indian households. Her mother tongue is, of course, rapidfire Burmese.Amma’s father was a Malay who came from Malaysia and married a pretty dark-eyed, slim Bangladeshi woman called Naseema. Together they had six children.Today Amma’s father is no more, but her mother, reed thin and stooped at 82, still survives. Amma is her youngest daughter.She was married when barely 17, to Mohammad Aslam. He worked as a driver with the Australian Embassy but died of kidney failure. Amma was barely 40. To support her family, she began working as a cook. Praveena took to cleaning and looking after the house.These women are part and parcel of the house, a colonial British bungalow with sloping red tiled roof and wooden park floors. All around there are swaying coconut trees and a profusion of orangeflower bushes that line the garden. There are delightful shrubs in maroon, lime green and red and white.That isn’t all. Orchids and serpentine vines of the elephant-eared money plant hang in their own fashion from a large shady tree whose name I have yet to decipher.The wind chimes from Thailand, hanging in the doorway, make their own music whenever the wind blows. I got them while browsing in the local colourful market where women rule the roast.Markets are the domain of women. In fact, I got the wind chime from a lively-eyed woman who sold it with a smile that crinkled her eyes so much till they disappeared.The chime displays wheat coloured birds, the sun, moon, the stars and Chinese good luck fishes all baked to perfection. Their music is wonderfully soothing to the ears.We make a quaint threesome – Amma, Praveena and I. We usually sit on the green mosaic stairs of the verandah. I with my notebook, Amma a rotund figure with a liberal smattering of grey in her hair. She coils it so that it circles her comb in a traditional style.Praveena is a modern girl. She doesn’t like the sticky coconut oil her mother favours for her hair. Instead, her curly waist-length hair is shampooed and left loose, small tendrils flying in thewind as her voice, animated by the tale she is recounting, rises and falls.She stops now and then to struggle for the right word in Hindi to describe something and there’s a staccato burst of Burmese as mother and daughter consult.Amma looks heavenward for inspiration while I look expectantly from one to the other. And then Amma suddenly comes up with a rush of words which are surprisingly enough, colonial Hindi. Words that I’d thought, were gone for ever, like my childhood and the remnants of the British Raj.","keyword":"[\"amma\", \"praveena\", \"chime\", \"madhu\", \"hindi\", \"wind\"]","ALS":"22.75862068965517"},{"english_id":"272","id":"273","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"The Taziyas of Old Delhi","article":"I was wandering in the crowded streets of Chandni Chowk, the heart of purani Dilli or Old Delhi. Until India gained independence in 1947 and a new Delhi came up, it was the ‘only’ Delhi. For close to 300 years, it had been the seat of Mughal power and culture, especially when it came to cuisine. And that is what drew me to that place!I had taken the day off to savour Chandni Chowk’s famous parathas and the juicy sweet jalebi at the famous 200-year-old sweet shop, Ghantewala.But, once there, food wasn’t the only thing that crossed my mind. I was tempted to check out the stores selling silver, imitation jewellery, stationary and other knick-knacks that abound in the place.Suddenly some big colourful structures caught my attention. A closer look showed that they were made of transparent coloured paper wrapped around four bamboo sticks. What could it be?“Ise taziya kahte hain (This is called taziya),” said a voice behind me. Seeing my puzzled look, the man explained patiently.Taziyas are replicas of the tomb of Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad who was killed in the battle of Karbala, on the tenth day of Muharram month, which is the first month of the Islamic calendar.It is to remember the martyrs killed in the battle of Karbala that believers take out processions of mourning. It is as if they are enacting the battle and the subsequent grief during the procession. And the taziya becomes an important symbol of remembrance.That is why so much care is taken in the making of the taziya, which is seen as an honour. Only a few chosen families are involved in making taziyas and the art has been passed down the generations.The making of the taziyas starts almost a month-and-a-half before Muharram. Taziyas come in different shapes and sizes. Three dimensional bamboo frames are erected and covered with sheets of transparent, butter, glossy or opaque paper.These frames are mounted on top of each other to give height and shape. One common design is a square base with a dome on top. The bamboo and paper is embellished with gilt and mica.On Muharram, Muslims take out a procession bearing a large number of taziyas and alams (pennants of Hussain’s army). The mourners beat their chests with grief over the murder of Imam Hussain and cry “Hussain! Hussain!” in collective sorrow.The taziyas are taken to the imambara, a place symbolic of Karbala, where they are broken and buried.Happy with what I had seen and learnt, I thanked the gentleman and decided to make a move.

For the spiciest, tongue-burning experience yet, head for Assam –that’s where the hottest chilies are grown.For years, Mexico’s ‘Red Savina Habanero’ was believed to be the hottest chili in the world.But now a chili grown in Tezpur, Assam, in northeastern India, is being touted as the hottestchili ever. And coming from a state, which is better known for its tea than its chilies, thisdiscovery has caused quite a stir.The ‘hotness’ of chilies comes from the compound called capsaicin located in the white tissue,which holds the seeds. When you stir fry chilies this compound is released and can take yourbreath away. Scraping away the tissue and removing the seeds reduces the hot flavour ofchilies.The Tezpur chili is nearly 50 per cent spicier than the Mexican chili as it has the highestScoville units of pure capsaicin. The Scoville scale is named after German scientist, WilburScoville, who was the first to measure the heat component in chilies. The Indian chili wasdiscovered to contain 855,000 Scoville units vis-à-vis the Mexican chili, whichcontains only 557,000 Scoville units of pure capsaicin.The World’s Hottest Chili []Chilies belong to the Solanaceae family, as do potatoes, tomatoes and eggplants. Chilies werefirst cultivated in Peru and Bolivia over 7000 years ago and were widely grown in Central andSouth America. The Spanish explorer, Christopher Columbus, took some chilies back to Spain in1493. He though they were black pepper, and his mistake resulted in chilies beingdubbed ‘chili peppers’.Did you know that chilies are addictive? That is because it increases the production ofendorphins (the body’s natural pain-relieving hormones), which in turn produce a feeling ofwell-being. The burning feeling on your tongue (due to the capsaicin)causes messages to be sent to your brain, to release endorphins. The endorphinsthus released give you some relief.Fresh chilies have twice the amount of Vitamin C found in citrus fruits. When dried,the Vitamin A content increases as much as one hundred fold. Hot chilies (like the Habanerovariety) contain about 357 per cent more Vitamin C than oranges. Chili is mildlyantibacterial and is an excellent gargle for sore throats and laryngitis. InVictorian England, chili peppers were prized for their warming propertiesin treating arthritis, chills, rheumatism, sprains and depression.India is the biggest exporter of chilies – the most popular drug-herb – in theworld today.

A world-class chess champion who was given the name of Lightning Kid because of the speed with which he played.But how are world class champions like Vishy born? For that, ask his mother Sushila. In 1974, when he was five, she first opened a chessboard and taught him the game. She was also his first opponent in the game. Anand was her youngest child.For many of us chess is a very complex game. But it is interesting that most champions often start playing chess in their childhood. Luckily, Anand was living in Madras (now Chennai), which was known as the chess capital of India.Madras had produced India’s first International Master, Manuel Aaron in 1961. Seventeen years later, in 1978, Madras produced India’s second International Master, V. Ravi Kumar. Anand too started playing in local tournaments.In the same year the boy’s life took a new turn. His father, who worked with the Indian Railways, was sent to the Phillippines for a project. Anand and his mother also went with him. Anand left chess-crazy Madras to go to a chess-crazy country – the Philippines! Asia’s first Grandmaster, Eugene Torre, was a Filipino. Florencio Campomanes, who was the President of the world chess organisation, FIDE, at that time was also a Filipino.And the famous world chess championship match between Soviet Grandmaster Anatoly Karpov and Victor Korchnoi, also took place in Philippines’ capital Manila in 1978. Chess was the biggest sport in Philippines. It seemed as if Anand had reached paradise.Viswanathan Anand – The Lightning Kid []There were daily chess programmes on television. Unlike children of his age, he preferred chess programmes to cartoons, and chess magazines to comics! And if ever the postman delivered his magazine during lunch time, Anand would leave the food untouched, and bury his nose inside the book.For Anand the best part of the magazine was the chess puzzle given at the end of each programme. He would solve it and send back the answer. Most often he was right. He won so many prizes that the programme officials finally decided to keep a limit to the answers he could send!His first important world championship was in Paris, in 1983. He finished third despite being unwell. His mother was his most important support; she helped him cope with the pressure of the big match. She often accompanied him on his tours.During those times when she was in Madras, Anand would often call her at the most difficult moment of his match. He would speak to her and get his confidence back.In 1985, Anand became an Asian champion. He was also India’s youngest International Master. Two years later, in 1987, he won the world junior championship, in the Philippines. He was the first Asian to achieve this feat. The same year he became India’s first Grandmaster. He had just turned 18. The Lightning Kid had arrived.Today, Anand is number two in the chess world. Twice he has been close to becoming the world champion. In 1995, he played against Garry Kasparov and lost. In 1997, he lost to Anatoly Karpov in the official world championships. That is the one goal the young champion has set his eyes on.But at 30, he can be very proud of one thing. His success has made chess a popular sport with youngsters in India. That is why India today is proud of having so many junior world champions like Pentyala Harikrishna, Koneru Humpy and Aarthie Ramaswamy, and more than twice that number of Asian champions.<>","keyword":"[\"anand\", \"chess\", \"champion\", \"madras\", \"philippine\", \"championship\"]","ALS":"18.289473684210527"},{"english_id":"277","id":"278","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"We Would All Scream Without Ice Cream","article":"Can you imagine a summer without ice creams?It seems the Chinese, too, couldn’t. For it was they who gave the world its first ice cream. In India, the Mughals are said to have introduced their kind of ice cream — the kulfi. The exact date of origin of the ice cream is not known.Kulfi is a mixture of khoa, pistachio nuts and saffron essence frozen in conical metal containers after sealing it with dough — exactly the same way as it is made today! Khoa is made by boiling milk on slow fire till it becomes semi-solid.This recipe was listed in the Ain-i-Akbari, more than 400 years ago by Abul Fazl, the biographer of Emperor Akbar.According to Fazl, it was Akbar who introduced saltpetre for cooling water in India. Water was poured into small containers, which was placed in larger containers having water and saltpetre. These containers were removed after seven or eight minutes.About 300 years ago, many families had an abdar, or servant who stayed up all night to move an earthen jug of water in a larger vessel carrying water and saltpetre. The contents of the earthen jug would be chilled by morning.The Ain-i-Akbari also contains detailed descriptions about how ice was transported to Delhi from the Himalayas by river and then over land.But, the Harshacharita, which was written much before Akbar’s time, in the 7th century AD or about 1,400 years ago, also mentions ways of keeping things cool by using ice. Historians believe the ice must have been brought from the Himalayas as they continued to do in the Mughal period.In 1775, an English judge described the process of ice-making in Allahabad, now in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Perhaps ice was always made in the area by the same process since long. But no one knows since when.Water was cooled overnight in winter when the temperature was close to freezing point, but never below it. Boiled water was poured into small, shallow, porous vessels, which were placed in shallow pits. These pits were well insulated at the bottom and the sides and were made by scooping out earth in a covered place. The ice, which would form overnight, would then be kept in insulated pits.The British, too, began using this technique on a large scale about 200 years ago in the 19th century and stored it for use all the year round.","keyword":"[\"cream\", \"saltpetre\", \"container\", \"water\", \"cool\", \"khoa\"]","ALS":"31.642857142857142"},{"english_id":"278","id":"279","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Weave of Survival","article":"To unravel the story behind the famed Kota doria sari, Aditi De of the Women’s Feature Service, travelled to Kota in Rajasthan recently. From there she went to the hamlet of Kaithoon, 15 km from Kota. Kaithoon is the real home of the legendary Kota Doria sari. The creation of each sari is a work of art, involving the labour of the entire family of the weaver. The weaving is mainly done by the daughters of the family, most of whom are small girls too busy working to go to school.Pastel shades of peach, azure or lemon yellow, with refined zari borders enriched by golden checks. Or beige backdrops on which are stamped block prints of mangoes, leaves, peacocks and paisleys. Some of you must have seen these and similar designs on the prized Kota saris of your mothers.The Kota sari is a delicate network of natural cotton and silk threads, and is fine as muslin. That is why it’s worn during summer, it is so light to touch.The city of Kota is situated on the eastern bank of the Chambal river in Rajasthan.A half-hour drive past mustard fields, a sharp turn into a maze of cobbled streets, and we are in Kaithoon. A ragtag bunch of children, eyes bright with curiosity, hair matted with grime, follow at our heels as we disembark. The cobbles are spattered with goat droppings. Open sewers line the narrow streets.The world outside recedes as we step into the darkness of a dwelling, where Zahida, a woman of about 30, is busy at a loom. She exchanges a few words with my Rajasthani friend in Hadoti, a language that sounds like Gujarati. Hadoti, the language of theHadas is a legacy of Rao Deva, the Hada chieftain who founded Kotain the 12th century.Zahida’s father, Moinuddin, his hands gnarled with work, his beard grey with experience, uncovers a woven pallav. Against a fine background of midnight blue, we scan floral bouquets in burnt gold reminiscent of Mughal motifs. Spectacular enough to steal the show at a wedding. Pretty enough for a princess.“It takes about a month to weave an elaborate sari. But it takesonly a week for a simpler one,” says Zahida. She adds that each weaver earns about Rs. 300 each for a sari.We learn that these skilled weavers are not able to market their own weaves. It is at this point that merchant middlemen – like Hamid Bihari at Kaithoon who supplies the yarn and sells the saris – step in.All the Muslim families in Kaithoon are weavers. They make up about seven percent of the 20,000 weavers in the city.Weaving is a family profession in Kaithoon. Fathers, mothers, children….everyone is involved. Daughters are trained from the time they are 12 years old.

Chances are that many would think of the mushroom cloud made by the atomic bombs that were dropped by the United States over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on August 6 and August 9, 1945, during the Second World War.Bombs wiped out more than half the population of the cities, and made the survivors and future generations suffer the harmful effects of radiation, in the form of terrible diseases and illnesses.“Passing on to the younger generations the memories and the will of those who suffered the bombing is the most important step for humankind to survive in the 21st century.

The game was then called Chaturanga – chatur meaning four and anga meaning parts. The game comprised the four parts of the army: elephants, horses, chariots and foot soldiers besides the king and his mantri (minister).The game was in fact a battle-plan drawn on a smaller scale, to find out ways and means of outsmarting the enemy.How was it played? In the game, one side of the army had to knock out or capture the opponent’s pieces from the board until the king was captured or ‘checked’, that is, made immobile. The player who ‘checked’ the opponent king’s movements won the game.It is still played in the same way.From India, soldiers and merchants took the game to Persia (present day Iran) around 600 A.D. where it came to be called Shatranj. At the same time travellers took the game to China where it was played in a modified form called Xianqui. The Japanese, when they came to know of it, called it Shogi.The Crusaders from Europe who came to fight the Holy Wars in Palestine against the Muslim Saladdin in the 12-13th century took the game to Europe. They called it ‘chess’ from the Old French word ‘echec’ meaning ‘check’.The pieces were made of ivory and consisted of a King, Rook or Castle (the elephants of Chaturanga times); knights (horses and cavalry) and Pawn (foot soldiers). To be in the good books of the powerful Catholic influence of the time, a piece called the ‘Bishop’ was also added. The most important piece, the minister, was replaced by the only female piece, the Queen.Chess became very popular in no time. Landlords during the Renaissance period of the 12th and 13th centuries even played with live people who were beheaded instead of simply being captured!In time players discovered that the first few movements called ‘openings’ could decide the outcome of the game. Experts then kept notes on the games of their opponents, how they played earlier and came up with strategies to preempt these moves.It was only in the 20th century that chess began to be played as a professional game. Seeing how popular these were, newspapers began to publish each game move by move. Then in 1924 the Federation Internationale des Echecs (FIDE) was set up to formulate rules to supervise the game. Players also began to be rated for their performance. They were called International Masters. If they were the best of the best they became known as Grandmaster.FIDE also laid the rule that every player must say ‘echec’ or ‘check’ when the king is in a position of being captured. The king is therefore checkmated ending the game. The word ‘checkmate’ literally means ‘the King is dead’ from the word ‘echec mat’ which in turn came from the Persian word ‘shah mat’.Computers too made the game easier to learn and play. While the average computer can beat an amateur, most experts can beat the computer.Today chess is a popular international sport made famous by India’s own Grandmaster Vishwanathan Anand. Other chess greats include the American Bobby Fisher, Russians Gary Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov, players with huge fan followings. There’s even a separate Olympics for chess, held every two years! Once a pastime of the old, today it is common to see children at six or seven years in international games.The same board is also used to play the game of Draughts or Checkers. Its origin?

In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson approved of this idea, but it was not until 1924 when President Calvin Coolidge made it a national event. Then in 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed a presidential proclamation implementing an official Father’s Day.

With the spread of Christianity, the day clashed with Easter festivities and new year’s day was shifted to April 1. However, the calendar was not exactly accurate and each year a day had to be adjusted to suit the change in seasons.In 1562, Pope Gregory introduced a new calendar taking into account this extra day. This became the leap year. In the new calendar, new year fell on January first.

He was just 15 when he invented his reading and writing system. It was a stroke of genius. He used just six raised dots on paper so people could feel each letter of the alphabet with their fingertip.

It falls between late March and late May. Easter is so important because Christians believe that Jesus rose from the dead, two days after he died on the cross. Jesus’ dead body was buried in a cave on Good Friday and two days later the stone that covered the cave’s entrance had been moved and Jesus’ body had gone. Various people saw Jesus in the following days and his followers understood God had raised him from the dead. Historians say this happened some time between 26 and 36 AD.\n\nPeople celebrate Easter in many ways around the world. It is a very busy time for churches. Many Christians light a special Paschal candle on the evening before Easter. This represents the rising of Christ. There are special songs and hymns which people sing in church. Children like Easter because their parents and grandparents give them chocolate Easter eggs, a sign of new birth. Schoolchildren usually decorate eggs and display them in their school or give them as gifts. Other things associated with Easter are the Easter Bunny and spring flowers like irises.

Several people also paint eggs or emboss chocolate eggs with sugar flowers to gift to friends and relatives.But what is Easter? Easter Sunday falls on the Sunday after Good Friday and on this day Easter eggs are available in the market – that is what most of us know. In reality, the preparation for Easter starts with a fast 40 days earlier, on Ash Wednesday.Easter’s Here [Illustration by Shinod AP]Also, did you know that Easter is associated with Passover, which is a Jewish festival? Or that because there is no fixed date for Passover, even the date for Easter is not fixed? Well, the fact is that Easter can fall on any Sunday between March 22 and April 25.But before going into these details, let’s see what Easter is all about.Easter comes from the word ‘eastre’ or ‘ostara’. The preparation for Easter begins with Ash Wednesday, which is so called because the priest marks the foreheads of people with ash, in the form of a cross. Ash Wednesday always falls on the seventh Wednesday before Easter.Ash Wednesday also marks the beginning of Lent, the season of fasting for Christians across the world. Starting Ash Wednesday, Christians fast for 40 days in preparation for Easter. This is because Jesus had fasted for 40 days before he started his public life as a preacher.Most Christians avoid eating meat and taking liquor during this period. Traditionally, these fast days are supposed to be spent in fasting, repentance and prayer.This period of fasting ends on Good Friday, the day when Jesus Christ was crucified. Before dying, he told his disciples that he would rise again two days later. And he did. That is why Easter, which always falls on a Sunday, is celebrated as a victory of life over death. It is a day of joy and happiness and is celebrated with great fervour.Interestingly, although Christmas, or the day of Christ’s birth is fixed for December 25, Easter does not have a fixed date. The Christian festival of Easter is associated with the Jewish festival of Passover because Christ’s arrest, trial, crucifixion and resurrection happened during this eight-day Jewish festival. Or at least, that’s what happened according to a Reader’s Digest publication, Why in the World.Easter is a festival and holiday celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the deadDuring Passover, the Jews thank God for saving them from slavery in Egypt. The Jewish slaves escaped from their masters and were led to the Promised Land by Moses.Since the Jews base their calendar on the rotation of the moon, and not the sun, the date for Passover keeps changing. Hence, Easter too is not on a fixed date. It is celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon after March 21.For centuries the Church has debated over why Easter cannot be on a fixed date. Several people also want to disassociate Easter from Passover. But how does one do that? Different churches have not agreed to any one proposal, yet.The Church may debate over Easter and when it should fall, but in actual fact, Easter has its roots in an even older festival. The period before Christianity was born is called the ‘pagan’ era by the Christians. Pagan means the belief in many Gods.Before Easter became a Christian festival, the pagans celebrated Eastre or Ostara. Ostara is the name of the goddess of spring among the Germanic tribes of northern Europe. The pagans celebrated Eastre to welcome spring after a hard winter. A time when everything was new – new leaves sprung up on the trees and the birds were mating.In fact, the Easter egg also originates from that era. The ancient Egyptians and Romans gifted eggs to each other because they symbolised a new life. Sometimes, colours, which depicted certain flowers, were painted on the eggs. The early Christians carried on this tradition and gradually, the eggs came to symbolise Easter – while their original meaning was forgotten.","keyword":"[\"easter\", \"passover\", \"christian\", \"fixed\", \"wednesday\", \"jewish\"]","ALS":"25.032258064516128"},{"english_id":"313","id":"314","level":"5","topic":"7","title":"Eid in Yusufpur","article":"Guess what guys?? My dad is taking me to his village for Eid this year. I am so excited that my tummy is all tied up in knots and I can hardly wait to get there. I haven’t yet enjoyed Eid the way papa says he used to when he was small. Well, I am hoping to do so this time.Let me start with the village first, the way my dad describes it. Yusufpur is a sleepy village in Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh. Its almost as if the residents wait for festival time to wake up. And gosh, what a waking up it is.Eid in Yusufpur [Illustration by Anup Singh]Yusufpur during FestivalsOvernight, the village becomes a bustling, noisy and exciting place to be in – what with children in their festival best scampering around and having a gala time at the village mela (fair)! As kids, papa and his brothers had a whale of a time riding the giant wheel and the merry-go-round, seeing through the bioscope (old projector) and eating candyfloss and sweetmeats.This time the occasion is Eid-ul-Fitr. We people living in huge cities might wonder how a festival like Eid can get the whole village up and about. Well, village life in India is still a great experience as everyone lives together like the member of one massive family. So everyone celebrates every festival as if it’s their own.Dad says that in Yusufpur, Hindus come to our house to wish us and there is a lot of gale milna (embracing). They get buckets and buckets of milk to contribute to Eid. As you know, on Eid-ul-Fitr we make loads of seviyan (vermicelli) in milk, as that is what we eat most of the time. My grandmother and aunts will be making seviyan all day for the visitors.This is the most important of all the Eids and we kids are excited because we also get eidee (pocket money) from all our relatives. We can even demand it, dad says!! The best part is that I have about 45 to 50 relatives there. What fun this is going to be! Papa says he used to collect enough money for the whole month…All that Eid Shopping…Though Eid is nearly a fortnight away, my clothes shopping has already started, as dad says that everyone, even the smallest baby will have new clothes and I should look good.I am getting two to three sets of kurta-pajamas made. It seems one set is not enough as the clothes usually end up getting dirty with all the seviyan and kebab crumbs falling on them!!My grandfather used to take all his children to Varanasi, as that is the closest city to Yusufpur, for the shopping, which started almost as soon as Ramzan (Ramadan) started! The tailors were told to make the clothes specially well for Eid. There were shervanis, churidars and topis for the men and kurta pajamas and topi for the boys. Papa says that women, from the oldest to the youngest look radiant on this day – in colourful clothes and lots of jewellery.On Eid day, everyone gets up very early, bathes and wears new clothes. Then my grandfather, being the eldest, leads all the men and boys to the mosque for prayers. After the prayers, the fun time starts! The mela begins and people start to arrive in the house to exchange greetings.Papa says that by the end of the day his shoulders would start to hurt as everyone had to be embraced and wished Eid Mubarak (Happy Eid). I’m taking some pain-killing ointment along, just in case!!Uh oh!! Dad has just told mom to pack medicine for loose motions, too. He says all the eating and feasting leads to a really bad tummy the next day!!As told to Manisha Deveshvar by Asif Ansari","keyword":"[\"village\", \"yusufpur\", \"papa\", \"clothes\", \"seviyan\", \"tummy\"]","ALS":"22.53125"},{"english_id":"314","id":"315","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"Elimination of Racial Discrimination Day","article":"March 21 is International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It commemorates a tragedy that happened in the town of Sharpeville in South Africa on this day in 1960. Police opened fire and killed 69 people at a peaceful demonstration against the apartheid laws. The massacre shocked the world. For many years this day was known as Sharpeville Day in South Africa. In 1966, the UN General Assembly created this special day, calling on all countries to redouble their efforts to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination, once and for all. Every March 21st, the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva and New York conduct activities to highlight the evil of racism and our duty to combat it.\n\nThis day perhaps played a role in the ending of apartheid in South Africa. Today the country is a multi-racial society where the government is promoting equality at all levels. The ending of apartheid and the discrimination that went with it opened up South Africa to greater economic development. UN General-Secretary Ban Ki-moon spoke of how racism affects human rights and becomes an obstacle to a nation’s development: “Racist practices hurt their victims, but they also limit the promise of entire societies where they are tolerated. They prevent individuals from realizing their potential and stop them from contributing fully to national progress.” Racism is still a damaging force in today’s world.

It is held on April 15 because this is how far into a new year that a woman must work to earn what a man earned in the previous year. Statistics released in 2008 showed that women earned on average 77.8 percent of their male colleagues’ earnings. Asian American women did a little better than this. For African American and Hispanic women, the figure was lower. This is happening in America today, even though equal pay was passed into law in 1963. Many women see the equality as doubly unfair because statistics also show that American women are better educated than men.\n\nOn Equal Pay Day, thousands of business and professional women and hundreds of civil rights and labour organizations take part in fair pay campaigns. They hold events across America demanding a fair wage. A lot of the campaigning is coordinated by the National Committee on Pay Equity, which started Equal Pay Day in 1996. Eula Tate of the Coalition of Labor Union Women says equal pay is not just a woman’s issue: “If women are only paid 77 cents when they should get a dollar, their family suffers....Working families lose about $200 billion in income every year because of this pay discrimination,” she said. Campaigners usually wear red ribbons on this day as a symbol of how women and minorities are “in the red” with their pay.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"woman\", \"equal\", \"earn\", \"american\", \"statistic\", \"fair\"]","ALS":"22.46153846153846"},{"english_id":"316","id":"317","level":"5","topic":"18","title":"European Day of Languages","article":"September the 26th is the European Day of Languages.

The latter part is a special attraction, especially with children! We bring you some mouthwatering recipes that are part of the Navaratri and Durga Puja celebrations.Interestingly, chana, or chickpea – also called Bengal gram and Garbanzo – is part of festival food across India. It is the key ingredient in the Bengali Chholar Dal, the Tamil Chundal and the Maharashtrian Pooran Poli.Chana has been around for thousands of years. It has been found in archaeological excavations as early as 2500 BC (4,500 years ago) in Kalibangan, during the time of the Harappa civilisation. Buddhist writings of 400 BC (2,400 years ago) make a mention of it, as do much older Sanskrit texts like the ‘Vishnu Purana’.The dishes, for which recipes are given below, are made on each day of the Navaratris. While women fast, the children and men in the family tuck in with relish. Do try them out, and if there are some festival favourites you would like to share with us, just write in.Chholar Dal – a Bengali favourite that is served with ‘Luchi’(the north Indian puri or fried pancake) made of refined flour or maida.Ingredients– 250 gms chholar dal or chana dal– 3-4 tablespoons oil– 1 tablespoon jeera– 1\/2 tablespoon grated ginger– 4-5 tejpata leaves– chopped green chillies– 1\/2 cup grated coconut– 1\/2 tablespoon turmeric– 1 tablespoon sugar– hing or asafoetedaMethod– boil 250 gms of chholar dal in 2 cups of water.– heat oil in pan– add hing, jeere, tejpata, grated ginger, chopped chilles, grated coconut, salt, sugar, turmeric, and fry for some time.– pour the boiled dal into the pan.– cook till well blended.

It is as if they are seeing it for the first time. In the actors they see the epic come alive; the actors, too, do not remain untouched by the fervent chants of the audience every now and then, ‘Bol Siyapati Ram ki Jai’ (Hail Sita’s husband Rama’)In Gujarat, Dussehra is unthinkable without the hugely popular and highly energetic men’s folk dance of the Dandiya-ras or the Garba by women. And, in West Bengal or any Bengali-locality in India celebrating Durga Puja, life is incomplete without the melodrama of the Jatra folk theatre.Fun’tastic world of RamlilaThese performances enable people to get together and feel a sense of community, though each individual may see something different in them. After all, epics like the Ramayana are full of role models for humans – the ideal ruler, the ideal son, the ideal husband or wife. And depending on who the viewers are and what their situation is, they see these performances differently. Plays in the Jatra form also touch upon everyday values and situations.Few traditional performances match the popularity of the Ramlilas though, which are a dramatised depiction of events in the life of Rama. These trace their origins to more than 300 years ago when the Hindi poet Tulsidas dramatised certain portions of his Ramcharitmanas and presented them at Banaras (Varanasi).Different areas of the city of Banaras were named after places in the epic Ramayana and Ramlila plays were enacted there over several nights. The presentation culminated on Dusshera with the burning of the effigies of Ravana and his relatives.It continues to be a colourful affair to this day in Banaras, whose neighbourhoods are choc-a-bloc with Ramlilas. The performances go on at their own pace: in one locality Rama and Sita are getting married; in another, Sita is being abducted; and in yet another, Rama’s forces are fighting Ravana.The Mother of all Ramlilas – in BanarasBy far the most spectacular and popular Ramlila in India is held at Ramnagar on the bank of the Ganga, near Banaras. Enacted over a period of 30 days, this Ramlila is a moving performance – literally. If the action moves from a palace to a jungle, the acting area changes too, and the audiences also move with the performance.Different scenes are enacted at different places, which in turn are associated with the actual locales of Ramayana. The Ramlila performance becomes a moveable feast for the eyes!From Dandiya ras to Disco DandiyaOr take the Dandiya ras and Garba in Gujarat, whose popularity is growing day by day. The Dandiya had its origins in the Limbdi region of the state, and was a dance based on the Ramayana, performed only by men. Dressed in flounced jackets, they beat short lacquered sticks as they quickstep in a whirling circle to the beat of drums, songs and cymbals.Today the Dandiya is extremely popular among all Gujaratis, and is also catching up among other Indians, particularly young Indians ( very few festivals give boys and girls the opportunity to mix freely and dance the way Dandiya does).As a result, we now have Disco-Dandiya, with the city-bred hip set swinging to the beat of the music with the same abandon as they do to trance or techno music, the latest fads in western music.While the Dandiya-Ras has a relatively recent origin, the Garba, danced by women, dates much further back in time. Besides Navaratri, the Garba is also danced during the Holi and Basant Panchami festivals. Joyful songs and light, graceful, circular movements are typical of the Garba, which celebrates the Krishna theme. It is the favourite dance at community cultural gatherings.The Jatra of BengalUnlike the Dandiya-ras or the Ramlila, which are closely linked with the festivals that they are performed in, the Jatra, Bengal’s most popular form of theatre, is not historically linked with the Durga Puja. And that is why it can be performed anytime and not just during the Puja.Still, the Puja is the one time when interest in this performing art peaks among people, and one finds the state’s most famous Jatra troupes engaged in frantic tours across the state and outside.The Jatra had its origin in Vaishanava musical plays based on the Krishna theme introduced in Bengal by the 16th century Bhakti saint, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Today however, Jatras rarely cover the religious aspect, and deal with historical, social and political themes, mostly contemporary.A Jatra performance is marked by loud and dramatic acting, high-pitched dialogue delivery, much dancing and singing, glittering music and rich music.

Since the birthday falls on the full moon day of the month Kartik, that is the day that Sikhs all over the world celebrate the birth of their first guru.Gurpurab – the birth of Guru NanakGurpurbs are Sikh festivals which celebrate the lives of Guru Nanak and the nine gurus who followed him. Guru Nanak was born in 1469 in what is now Pakistan. At the age of 30 he mysteriously disappeared for three days. When he reappeared, he began to preach the Sikh faith and spent the rest of his life teaching, writing and travelling around the world to discuss religion with Muslims and Hindus.Sikhs celebrate Guru Nanak’s birthday and the other Gurpurbs with an Akhand Path, a reading of the Sikh holy scriptures, the Guru Granth Sahib, continuously from beginning to end. This is done by a team of Sikh men and women, each reading for 2-3 hours over 48 hours, beginning two days before and ending early on the morning of the birthday.On the day before the birthday, processions are held in India and in some parts of England. These are led by five people representing the original Panj Pyare (Five Beloved Ones) and followed by singers, musicians and even teams of people demonstrating martial arts.The Gurdwaras (places where Sikhs go to pray) are decorated with flowers, flags and posters depicting various aspects of Sikhism. Often they are also illuminated. Sikhs join together to sing, pray and eat together. On the morning of the anniversary, celebrations begin early, at around 4 or 5am, with keertan (musical recitation of hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib) and katha (lectures on Sikhism). These celebrations go on until around 1 or 2 pm.After this, Karah Parsaad is served. This is halwa, a sweet-tasting food which has been blessed. It is made from semolina or wheat flour, sugar and ghee (clarified butter) and is served warm. The congregation then shares a langar (meal) from the free kitchen. Nowadays, celebrations also include fireworks.Sometimes the festival extends into the evening, with prayers and hymns continuing long into the night. Sikhs who are unable to visit the Gurdwara during the festival hold a similar ceremony in their own homes.","keyword":"[\"guru\", \"sikh\", \"nanak\", \"sahib\", \"sikhism\", \"birthday\"]","ALS":"29.8125"},{"english_id":"331","id":"332","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"Holi is For Children","article":"Kamla Mathur was born and brought up in Etah, a small town in Uttar Pradesh. Now, at 65, she lives in Delhi and reminisces fondly of the Holi she and her siblings celebrated at ‘home’, in the area called Brajbhoomi, the land where the Braj dialect of Hindi is spoken. Brajbhoomi refers to the places connected to the legends of the birth and childhood of Krishna and his dalliance with Radha.As Holi continues to be a significant festival for the Brajvasis, many of the old ways of celebration survive. However, with time, the community feeling has lessened somewhat. Kamla Mathur takes us back to her childhood when Holi meant sheer fun.Holi is For Children [Illustrations by Shinod AP]When I was small, our Holi celebrations used to go on for 20 days. In Etah, Holi started on Basant panchami, the festival that announces the arrival of spring and almost everyone used to be dressed in yellow.In the morning, the idol of Lord Krishna would be taken out on a rath or chariot in a procession. All the while the attendant priests would sprinkle gulal (dry powdered colour) and gulab jal (rose water) on the onlookers. Do you know this procession used to be taken out at 7 a.m. especially so that we children would not miss out on it – we had to go to school after that.The next few days would be spent visiting friends. A dash of gulal or chandan (sandalwood) powder on the forehead was the usual practice. The wild celebration was reserved for badi (big) Holi. My mother used to make gulal at home by grinding dried flowers. So, for those few days the whole house smelt of flowers and chandan.Four days before Holi, came the day of rang pashi. It was spent in making food, decorating the house and dressing up. A traditional meal would comprise kadhi (a dish made of curd and ground Bengal gram) and rice, roti and a vegetable. This was offered as bhog or offering to Lord Krishna first thing in the morning.Then the women would get busy making rangoli (floor patterns) and cleaning the house for guests in the evening. We children would patter around – helping a bit, spoiling a bit more! I used to help my mother make kanji or a cool drink with vada or a fried ball of fermented lentil and gujiyas, a sweetmeat. This would be for the evening.Rang Pashi was a very important day for us and for a new daughter-in-law in the family. In the evening, the women would dress up in their dandiya – a white saree with specially dyed pink borders and bedeck themselves in jewellery.A white sheet would be spread out in the living room for the family members and relatives to sit in a circle with a plateful of gulal and coloured water made from the tesu flower, in the centre. Then, starting from the eldest, everyone would put some colour on each other and tuck into the food!You know, something very exciting would happen that day. The new daughter-in-law was supposed to watch for an opportunity to lock up all the elders of the house into a room. And then she could ask for anything from anyone – jewellery, new clothes, anything! The in-laws, uncles and aunts could not refuse her. After all, she would not let them out till they agreed to give what she demanded! We used to have a lot of fun on this day.The eve before Holi is puranmachi or full moon day. On that day, Holi is burned at a time decided by the priest. The fire signifies the triumph of good over evil. We would all walk around the fire once and make plans for the next day.On Holi day, there are no constraints. You can put as much colour on anyone and drench anyone repeatedly. We used to make bucketfuls of tesu water and gulal at home.Traditionally, only a few colours of gulal were made. Red colour with rose flowers, orange colour with harshringhar flowers, light yellow colour with tesu flowers and white colour with chameli flowers. Sometimes, rarely though, my mother would add a pinch of finely ground silver to the colours to add a touch of glitter in them.By noon on Holi we would be completely exhausted. And all we would think about was lunch and sleep.All these celebrations and get-togethers used to be a build-up to the final day – each occasion made us aware of the changing seasons, the landscape, the cropping patterns and the changing feelings in our hearts as winter changed to spring.Nowadays the celebrations are quite toned down and people are increasingly letting go of customs. I think this dilutes the fun in a festival, especially for children. But then, the times are very different.As told to Manisha Deveshvar","keyword":"[\"holi\", \"colour\", \"gulal\", \"flower\", \"tesu\", \"krishna\"]","ALS":"25.571428571428573"},{"english_id":"334","id":"335","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"Hot Dog Day","article":"In the USA, July is National Hot Dog Month.

At sundown, after a whole day of not eating or even taking a sip of water, the fast is broken. It is the time when the family gets together and eats a light but energy-giving healthy meal. This is Iftar, or the meal that breaks the fast.But ask anyone about the famed Iftar parties and the response: “Oh Iftar! Hi-fi parties. That’s one place where politics and authentic mughlai food mingle…”So, how many of us know what the term Iftar party really signifies? What is this new meaning of that word? Are Iftar parties as we know them a new phenomenon or have they been part of the Ramzan ethos always? Recently, I discovered something interesting that I wanted to share with you.To start with, the meaning of Eid-ul-Fitr has to be clarified. This one month of fast is a period meant to be devoted to self-purification, helping the poor and concentrate on God. It is not a time to enjoy or feast. Unfortunately, this is what Iftar parties have come to signify.Also, little to no non-vegetarian food is consumed during this period. The traditional food includes energy-giving dates, sweetmeats and seviyan (vermicelli pudding). The scientific reason behind this is that after a whole day of fasting, a light and healthy meal is recommended. However, Iftar parties now connote a time feasting with “mouth-watering kababs, good mughlai food and palao gosht.” The dates and seviyan are sidelined into insignificance.Difficult to believe though it is, at an Iftar party organized by the Speaker to the Lok Sabha (House of Commons) G M C Balayogi recently, several people were shocked when music was played!People waiting for Iftar near the Eyup Sultan Mosque at Ramadan. Prometheus72 \/ Shutterstock.comOver time, the Iftar too has changed in character. Just like corporates and businesses take the opportunity to cash in on Diwali and Christmas sentiments by sending sweets and cakes to build their company image and get favours, similarly the feelings behind Iftar are exploited. Politicians have started throwing Iftar parties for politically influential Muslims in order to woo the Muslims and get their votes.So how did the concept of Iftar get so badly distorted?It was Jawaharlal Nehru, former Prime Minister, who started holding Iftar parties for ambassadors from Arabic countries. His daughter, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, continued this tradition.

It wanted to strengthen international cooperation to help indigenous people. In particular, in the areas of culture, education, health, human rights and economic development. It also wanted to ensure their survival as many indigenous cultures were in danger of dying out. Many indigenous people today are under threat from globalization. Multicultural companies in search of profits are destroying their habitats. Their culture is being weakened as they move into cities in search of work.\n\nAn indigenous people is any ethnic group who have inhabited a geographic region for hundreds or thousands of years. One expert said an indigenous people is “a politically underprivileged group, who share a similar ethnic identity that is different to the nation in power, and who have been an ethnic entity in the locality before the present ruling nation took over power”. The best-known examples of indigenous peoples are the Aborigines in Australia, the Inuit in the Arctic regions, and the Zulu in South Africa. Estimates are that there are 300 to 350 million indigenous people in the world today. This is just under six per cent of the total world population. This includes over 5,000 different people in more than 72 countries.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"indigenous\", \"ethnic\", \"region\", \"culture\", \"power\", \"nation\"]","ALS":"17"},{"english_id":"343","id":"344","level":"5","topic":"16","title":"International Day Against Drug Abuse & Illicit Trafficking","article":"June the 26th is International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.

It leads to considerable problems in most societies around the world. Drugs can destroy families, communities and lives and make people turn to crime. The revenues from drugs help tyrants stay in power and finance terrorist groups. Billions of dollars a year are spent on trying to catch international drug traffickers, and the drug dealers that plague our streets.

It is a combination of African and European music styles. It has a strong influence from West African traditional music. One expert said jazz differed from European music because it has “a special relationship to time, defined as 'swing' [and] a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role”. It is unclear exactly where the word “jazz” came from. Many believe it was California slang to refer to the new music black musicians were playing in Chicago around 1915.

They are monks who follow the Jain religion. They cover their mouths and noses to avoid any involuntary killing – even of germs.Sometimes they also carry small brooms to remove any small creature out of their way so that they do not unknowingly tread on it. Their lifelong attempt is to live by the principle of ahimsa or non violence. So it is with Jains who lead lives like you, me and others.Mahavir Jayanti [Illustration by Shinod AP]Jainism, a religion that originated in India in 6-5 century BC (about 2600 years ago), was founded by Mahavira. His birth anniversary, celebrated as Mahavir Jayanti every year, is the main festival of the Jains.The 24th and last in a line of preachers called Tirthankaras, Mahavira the teacher, as he was called, gave a concrete shape to ideas that had been voiced by the earlier saints. These ideas were a rebellion against the existing practices made popular by the priestly class of Hindus.It was one of the most interesting times in the history of the land we call India, specifically the Gangetic valley in present-day Bihar. Jainism was founded at a time of great social and economic upheaval in India.It was a period of transition, when an agrarian society was transforming itself into an urban-based one. This happened due to the rapid growth of trade and commerce in India which in turn led to the growth of towns and the expansion of a professional class of artisans and traders.The aspirations of these groups expressed themselves in new unorthodox ideas. They were voiced by people belonging to these groups. So, both Mahavira and Buddha belonged to the kshatriya class. Their ideas challenged the established Brahmanical aspects of Hindu religion and its endless rituals.Hindu caste hierarchy comprised of four groups: the brahmins or priestly class; the kshatriyas or warrior class; the vaishyas or trader class and the shudras or untouchables. The brahmins exploited the lower castes in the name of religion. They made expensive pujas (worship) complete with animal sacrifice a necessary part of Hinduism. This in turn kept many people out of its fold.Both Jainism and the more popular Buddhism, the most influential sects of the time, challenged these notions. That is why both preached equality. They offered the lower castes and the downtrodden hope and a place to belong. Both also condemn animal sacrifice strongly, the Jains going one step further and declaring even the inhaling of airborne germs while breathing, a sin.It is interesting to ask why these ideas became so popular at that time. The answer is simple: they made perfect sense at that time. The common people could not engage in the elaborate rituals that were an important part of Brahmanism at that time.Also, the rise in animal sacrifice was proving to be very expensive and was harmful to an agricultural society. Cattle was very important for clearing the land, ploughing the fields and milching. It was important that they not be killed in such large numbers.Jain statue, KhajurahoMost importantly, these ideas were expressed in Pali, a language\/script that could be easily understood by large sections of the common people. Brahmanism relied on Sanskrit, the language of the few.Initially Jainism did not encourage idol worship, was against the caste system, especially untouchability, and preached equality. However, in times to come, as the religion grew and acquired more converts, it became complex. Different groups came up that began to interpret the teachings differently.Jainism never became as popular and widespread as Buddhism. This was because it was more strict about even common people maintaining its principals. Its adherents came mainly from the trading community. The religion which originated in the Gangetic valley, spread to parts of northern, western and southern India and continues to hold sway to this day.","keyword":"[\"class\", \"jainism\", \"religion\", \"caste\", \"mahavira\", \"belong\"]","ALS":"25.714285714285715"},{"english_id":"363","id":"364","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"Makar Sankranti","article":"The colourful kite-flying festival of Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan, which falls on January 14 each year, marks the end of a long winter and the return of the sun to the northern hemisphere. Hence the name Uttarayan.According to Hindu astronomy, it is on this holiest day in the Hindu calendar, that the sun enters the zodiac of Makara or Capricorn, heralding the northern journey of the sun. The day is also of special significance, because on this day, the day and night are of equal hours.Makar Sankranti [Illustrations by Kusum Chamoli]Celebrated since time immemorial, among Hindus all over India, the day finds a mention even in the epic Mahabharata. We are told that the warrior hero Bhishma Pitamah, even on being fatally wounded and lying on a bed of arrows, lingered on till Uttarayan set in, to breathe his last.It is believed that the person who dies on his auspicious day escapes the cycle of birth and rebirth and that the soul mingles with the almighty.Makar Sankranti heralds the arrival of spring, the season of fruitfulness and plenty. And nothing signifies this better than the soft seeds of til or sesame. Across India, housewives prepare sweetmeats made from til – whether it is a basic mixture of til and jaggery, or laddus, or the famous til-poli of Maharashtra. In the southern part of India, the day is celebrated as Pongal, where a fullsome meal of lentils and rice liberally dashed with ghee is offered to gods, and then to family members.In the northern states, like Punjab, the festival is celebrated as Lohri, where the end of a bitter winter is marked with the burning of huge bonfires liberally fed with handfuls of til sweets, rice and sugarcane. In Uttar Pradesh, the festival is called Khichedi and a typical rice and lentil preparation (called Khichdi), with the mandatory dash of ghee, is offered not just to the Gods, but is also distributed among the poor.Interestingly, this is a time of celebration for Muslims too. Just out of the month-long fasts of Ramzan, Muslims celebrate the festival of Id just a few days prior to Makar Sankranti. Prayers and hectic preparation of food and the famous seviyan, or vermicelli pudding cooked in milk mark the day which is a time to eat the best and wear the brightest. Its a time of plenty, and a time to give, especially to those who are needy.The most colourful celebration of Makar Sankranti can be seen in the western states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Colourful kites dot the skies as each one attempts to outdo the other. As the sun sets, children and adults desperate to extend the day, add floating oil lanterns to the tails of their kites – a sight that brings to life the true meaning of the day: a return to light, to warmth, to the life-giving sun.A famous Sanskrit Shloka that expresses it best reads:Asato maa sadgamaya Tamaso maa jyotirgamaya Mrityoormaa amritam gamayaLead me, O Lord, from untruth to Truth from darkness to Light and from death to Immortality.","keyword":"[\"sankranti\", \"makar\", \"rice\", \"northern\", \"uttarayan\", \"herald\"]","ALS":"43.84615384615385"},{"english_id":"364","id":"365","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"Mardi Gras","article":"“Mardi Gras” is French for “Fat Tuesday”.

Muslims are people who follow the Islamic religion propagated by the Prophet Mohammed in the seventh century. Muslims believe that it was in this month that Allah revealed the holy book of the Muslims, the Koran (or Quran) to the prophet Mohammed.The Quran says that the fast of Ramdan is important as it tests devotion and faith. So believers fast from sunrise to sunset every day during the entire month of Ramdan. The roza (fast) is one of the strictest on earth and that means, no breakfast, no mid morning snack, no lunch and no water!The Month of 30 Fasts [Illustrations by Shinod AP and Anup Singh]Many people set aside two-and-a-half percent of his\/her income to give to the needy during this season. Other Muslim families give away at least 3.5 kg of food per family, as fitra (alms) to the poor.During the month of Ramdan, the day in a Muslim household begins early. Everyone is up and about by five in the morning, well in time for the sehri (the meal that must be eaten before day break). The early morning meal is a simple affair and is supposed to end about 40 minutes before daybreak. It’s the only meal to be had before nightfall.Mostly grown-ups and teenagers keep roza but children too can observe the fast. Not many children are able to observe rozas all the days of the month, but they do compete with each other to see who keeps the maximum number of fasts!The month-long fast ends with the sighting of the new moon when the actual celebrations of Eid ul-Fitr begin. Eid-ul-Fitr actually means the joy at the end of days of fasting.During the evenings, the menfolk gather at a masjid for a reading of the Koran and as the sun sinks out of sight, the muezzin (priest)‘s call signals the end of the day long fast. The roza is broken by consuming a few dates and sharbat (sweet juice) and it is time for the evening prayers.Once the prayers are over, Iftar (feast that breaks the fast) is next and the streets spring to life as vendors clamour to sell piping hot jalebis, sizzling kababs and skewered delicacies wreathed in steam and smoke.Islamic Holy PlaceWomen clad in burkhas, and men dressed in white kurta pajamas and colourful caps, can be spotted jostling through the crowds as groups of noisy children trail behind. Thick gravies simmer and bubble in huge cauldrons with friendly cooks ladling out huge helpings of spicy korma for visitors wishing to gorge on Iftari fare.The Iftar meal is invariably better than normal fare and is quite a treat after the day long fast, with the ladies of the house taking special care to prepare succulent dishes. The mosques are gaily lit and people visit each other – Iftar is a time for celebration and socialising.At the sighting of the new moon of the month of Shawwal (the month that follows Ramdan, in the lunar calendar) the 29 or 30 rozas of Ramdan, come to an end. People wish each other, “Chand Mubarak” (‘Eid Mubarak!’ is wished only after the Eid namaaz the next morning). Eid is a celebration of will power – the ability of people to keep rozas throughout the month.On the eve of Eid, milk is bought in large quantities for the traditional sheer korma (a pudding), and onions and potatoes are chopped and fresh chicken is bought for the biryani and chicken dishes. Eid is celebrated over two days. On the first day, the family stays at home and receives visitors while on the second day they go visiting friends and family.","keyword":"[\"fast\", \"ramdan\", \"month\", \"muslim\", \"roza\", \"rozas\"]","ALS":"38.72222222222222"},{"english_id":"402","id":"403","level":"5","topic":"12","title":"Religion Day","article":"World Religion Day takes place every year on the third Sunday in January.

In Calcutta, specially, almost every neighbourhood has a Puja Committee to organise the Puja in their locality, every year.Come September and the Committee members begin to meet at each other’s houses and chalk out plans for grand celebrations over endless rounds of cha(tea) and adda (discussion).Anyone can qualify – all one needs is boundless enthusiasm. These people set up the pandal or the tents that house the festivities. They also organise the idol-making, decide on the cultural programmes — and the feast. It’s all for the cause of Ma Durga. Above all, it’s fun!The Business of Festivals [Illustration by Shiju George]What is interesting is that these Puja celebrations have become big business for their organisers. In Calcutta and every other city with a sizeable Bengali population, the Pujas are often sponsored by big business groups. Even the devi stands under the protection of their bold, fluttering banners.In Delhi’s largely-Bengali colony, Chittaranjan Park, there are several big Pujas organised by the local Bengali community with the generous sponsorship of sponsors.The area outside the biggest Puja resembles a fair during this time, which is why it is known as the Mela Ground. Food stalls, saree stalls and book stalls jostle for space with merry-go-rounds here. Thousands throng the pandals for a taste of the festive spirit.They do come to see the Durga idol, but they also come for the cultural programmes organised in the evenings. The local performers from the neighbourhood make way for the various artists who are invited to perform, mostly with the lure of handsome fees, in the evenings. From jatra troupes and Calcutta pop sensations, to semi-classical vocalists, the Mela ground has seen and heard them all.The Pujas have always been occasions for lavish spending. In the 19th century, in Calcutta, the Daws, Mitras and Debs were wealthy families of North Calcutta who organised splendid Pujas in their own houses. The Pujas were a family tradition.More than 150 years later, the tradition still continues for these families (except the Mitras ) and several other old families of Calcutta. Organising them year after year reaffirms the status of these families as the most prominent ones in the city. Moreover, it’s a way of reliving past glories through grand celebrations.Many of the oldest Pujas have historic associations. Take the Ghosh family Puja of Pathuriaghata Street, for example. The Puja, which is 230 years old, used to be visited by Warren Hastings, the first Governor General of Bengal. Pujas such as these still make an effort to maintain the dignity of the past. But there are several others who seem to have lost it.","keyword":"[\"pujas\", \"calcutta\", \"puja\", \"organise\", \"stall\", \"durga\"]","ALS":"25.7"},{"english_id":"410","id":"411","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"The Commerce of Christmas","article":"Can you imagine a Christmas without lights? And no brightly illuminated shops, their racks groaning under the weight of colourful packets of cakes, wine, dolls and every other gift item you could possibly think of? Impossible? Like imagining Diwali without the fireworks?But isn’t it strange how festivals like Christmas and Diwali are virtually unimaginable without the accompanying glitz that goes with them? Take away the show, the giving and receiving of gifts and people’s enthusiasm about the festivals might evaporate in no time.The Commerce of Christmas [Illustrations by Shiju George and Shinod A.P.]Take Christmas. How did a festival that started out to celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ – a humble carpenter’s son who rose to become one of the most charismatic and compassionate saints that the world has ever seen – lose its spirit so profoundly? And become the most commercialised of all religious festivals?Stephen Nissenbaum believes he has the explanation. Nissenbaum, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, and author of a new book called, The Battle for Christmas, writes: “There never was a time when Christmas existed as an unsullied domestic idyll, immune to the taint of commercialism”. What he means is, from the beginning, Christmas – American style – has been ‘commercial at its very core’. And it’s well known that what America does, the rest of the world adopts blindly soon after.There was no Christmas in America in the beginning. As late as the first decades of the 19th century, Nissenbaum observes, “Christmas was neither a domestic holiday nor a commercial one”. The Puritans of New England suppressed it, even for a time forbidding it by law. The Puritans were one of several groups of white settlers in America, who followed a rigid spartan form of Protestant Christianity.For one thing, they argued, the New Testament gives no date – or season – for the birth of Christ. The New Testament is the later, and smaller of the two major divisions of the Christian Bible, and the portion that is canonical (authoritative) only to Christianity. The other reason is that they identified Christmas with the pagan rites of ancient Rome (rites practised by followers of a polytheistic religion – that is, a religion of many gods). But puritan rule did not last long.The commerce of ChristmasSoon Christmas was more like carnival time, when rowdies spilled into the streets with public displays of eating and drunkenness. ‘Wassailing’ was one very disruptive custom. Packs of poorer youth and workers would lay siege to the homes of the well off, demanding free drink and food.By the end of the 19th century Christmas celebrations began to be taken seriously. The day of Christmas, 25th December, became a public holiday. In cities like New York and Philadelphia, the ‘misrule’ of Christmas mobs had become so widespread that it threatened civic life. The wealthy hired guards to protect their property. Shopkeepers barred their doors; pedestrians stayed home.But Protestant America did not have the sanctioned religious festivals of Catholic Europe. Americans needed a tradition for celebrating Christmas. So they went ahead and invented one. With a little help from the myth of Santa Claus.In his poem of 1822, A Visit from St. Nicholas, Clement Clarke Moore, a very wealthy New Yorker, gave Americans a benign non-threatening night visitor whom all classes would welcome. St. Nick played the role of a wealthy benefactor distributing gifts to the dependent class. But instead of the working poor as a whole, his gifts were meant for children.Within five years of its publication, Moore’s poem became wholly associated with Christmas. Newspaper editorials began to speak of Christmas as ‘a festival sacred to domestic enjoyments’. Although public drinking and merrymaking continued the ‘real Christmas’, was gradually identified with rituals that centred on children and took place in the quiet of homes.The old Yule spirit of ‘letting go’ in December was transformed: what were loosened were the purse strings of the parents. If Christmas was a time for giving gifts, they had to be purchased. A logic completely in keeping with the capitalist ethos of America, in which sale of goods took precedence over everything else.By the middle of the 19th century, Santa Claus was a common figure in stories and advertisements. Santa Claus legitimised the expecting of gifts by children, no matter how difficult it might be for parents to procure them. The commercialisation of Christmas was thus complete.A recent Hollywood film, Jingle all the Way, shows all that a hapless father has to undergo, in order to get the sought-after toy that his son wanted. The father in the film is a well-paid professional; he is willing to spend any amount to get his hands on the toy. But what about a father who cannot afford a toy like that? His inability to buy the toy could be taken to mean he loves his child a little less, couldn’t it?Today Christmas, especially in the western countries, places an additional social pressure on people to buy and give gifts, to buy extra things for Christmas dinner and other celebrations. Gifts that they don’t really need and often cannot afford.Christmas is a money-raking season for merchants and corporates. All the signs associated with Christmas, the tinsel, Christmas trees, the decorations in shops and malls, and the gifts hidden in mistletoes, are meant to send out one prominent message – spend, spend like there’s no tomorrow.The really distressing thing is the way people across the world have eagerly responded to the message. The real Christmas message of love and brotherhood seem to have got lost on the way somewhere.","keyword":"[\"christmas\", \"gift\", \"nissenbaum\", \"puritan\", \"domestic\", \"wealthy\"]","ALS":"26.775"},{"english_id":"411","id":"412","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"The Making of the Goddess","article":"On an ordinary day, the names Kumartuli and Krishnanagar would not make much of a difference to a Bengali. But come Durga Puja, and these two ordinary towns near Calcutta, become the focus of great attention. For it is here that the clay idols of Durga are made. This age-old tradition of clay sculpture has been preserved by the community of Pals.Months before the Puja, clay artisans start to breathe life into the images of Durga.The Making of the Goddess []Body of bamboo, straw and clayThe basic structure of the huge platform is made with bamboo, as is the Durga idol’s skeleton. The flesh over the bones is made of straw tied with the help of jute strings. The palms, head and feet are made separately.As soon as one set of craftspersons finish making the straw body, the artisans specialising in clay work apply several layers of clay over the body, to give it a smooth look. It is at this point that the palms, head and feet are attached to the main torso.On being completed, the figure is given a skin colour of white. Then the whole statue is painted with earth colours like yellow and red. The head, palms and feet are made by the highest graded artisans or Pals.Making the head is a delicate processThe making of the head is a delicate process. The Pals make it with good-quality clay, giving delicate touches to the features. When completed, the head is dried. The liquid plaster of Paris is poured over it. This creates a mould.When the plaster dries, it is separated from the clay head. The plaster mould is now hollow and many more heads can be made by pouring clay into it.Finally the eyes are painted by the main artist. Then jute ‘hair’ is glued on, the idol is varnished and dressed up with fine clothes and ornaments.Preparing for the goddess’ visitCelebrations for the festival span a period of ten days. Since it is essentially a community affair, almost every colony or locality in Bengal erects tents for the grand Puja. So do Bengalis living outside the state. Artisans create beautiful tents or pandals, and there is rigorous competition to see who puts up the most lavish pandal.On the first day of the festival, hymns are recited to invoke the goddess in the heavens. This special recital is known as Mahalaya. The next five days are spent preparing for the grand yearly visit of ‘ma’, or mother as Durga is affectionately called in Bengal.Sixth day: breathing life into the idolOn the sixth day, called Mahashashti, the idol of the goddess is placed on a raised platform in the pandal. This is the day when the goddess is believed to arrive, accompanied by her children Ganesha and Kartikeya, as well as Lakshmi and Saraswati.It is then the turn of the priest to “put life” into the idol. This is done by a priest’s ceremony. For the next four days, the idol is treated as the goddess herself.In the entire making of the idol, it is possible to see the hierarchy of the Indian caste system in play. Craftsmen from lower castes make the skeleton, with the higher castes making the more delicate features, and the brahmin priest imparting “life” to the idol.","keyword":"[\"clay\", \"idol\", \"head\", \"goddess\", \"delicate\", \"artisan\"]","ALS":"25.541666666666668"},{"english_id":"412","id":"413","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"The Nine Nights of Navaratri","article":"This year, the end of September marks the onset of Navaratri or “nine nights” in the Hindu calendar. With this begins one of the most festive phases in India, with Durga Puja in east India, Dussehra in north, central and west India, and Saraswati Puja in South India. It also sets the stage for Diwali in the near future.Navaratri literally means ‘nine nights’. This nine-day period, sacred to Durga, is celebrated sometime in the months of October and November. It is considered the most auspicious time of the Hindu calendar.The Nine Nights of Navaratri [Illustration by Shiju George]Although it has different names in different parts of India, the festival celebrations centre on the conquest of good over evil. Every region has its own myths and reasons to explain this.Nine aspects of DeviThe nine different aspects of Devi are worshipped over the nine days, says a report on indiancultureonline.com. As Durga, she is the goddess beyond reach; as Bhadrakali she is the power of time; as Amba or Jagdamba, she is mother of the world; as Annapurna, she is giver of food and plenty; as Sarvamangala, she is the auspicious goddess; as Bhairavi she represents the fearful power of death; as Chandika or Chandi she is violent, wrathful, furious; as Lalita she is playful; and as Bhavani, giver of existence.The festivities culminate on the tenth day, called variously as Vijayadashmi, Dussehra or Dassain when people in most parts of India burn effigies of Ravana, his son Meghanatha and brother Kumbhakarna.The legendIt is believed that in ancient times, this was a festival intended for the Kshatriyas or warrior-class of India. After the four-month long monsoon when military activity was not possible, this was considered a good time to start afresh on one’s conquests. For nine days before starting on the war journey, kings prayed to the nine different aspects of Devi or Adishakti. They also prayed for their arms and ammunition. The tenth day was when the journey for the conquest began.The origin of this custom can also be traced to the Ramayana. According to it, Rama had to pray to the nine different aspects of Devi to be able to kill Ravana. He then accumulated enough power to kill Ravana on the tenth day, which was called Vijayadashmi or day of victory.Since then, the tradition of praying to the Devi for nine days has continued. The Kshatriyas believed that by doing so, they too would be able to defeat their most powerful enemy.On the eighth day, an animal is sacrificed by many communities, specially Gurkhas and other hill tribes who are believers in the Devi cult. This blood sacrifice is a way of thanking the goddess for a wish that has been granted. People often sacrifice a buffalo symbolic of the killing of Mahishasura by Durga.The practiceSome people fast on all nine days, eating only fruit and milk dishes. Some fast only on the eighth or ninth day. As the festival is dear to the mother goddess, on the eighth or ninth day many people invite over nine young girls from the neighbourhood. These girls are treated as the goddess herself. People ceremonially wash their feet, worship them and then offer food to the “girl-goddesses.On the first day of Navaratri, grains of barley are planted in the puja room of the house after a small puja. Every day some water is sprinkled on it. On the tenth day, the shoots are about 3 -5 inches in length. After the puja, these seedlings are pulled out and given to devotees as a blessing from god.The devout place the seedlings on their caps, behind their ears, and inside books to bring good luck. This custom suggests that the festival’s link to harvesting is quite pronounced. For soon after this festival, the sugarcane crop is harvested and the winter crops sown.The celebrationsIt is an occasion for vibrant festivities throughout the country. In Bengal and Orissa, during Navaratri, devotees of Durga fast and pray for health and prosperity. Different manifestations of Durga or Shakti are worshipped every night.In the Western part of the country, in Gujarat and Maharashtra, devotees and young people dance the Garba and Dandiya-Raas all through the night. While garba is slow, dandiya is an exuberant dance. Both dances have dancers striking their sticks in a rhythmic movement.The Navaratri festival celebrations in Ahmedabad and Baroda in Gujarat are famous throughout India. Here, the evenings and nights are occasions for the fascinating Garba dance. The women dance around an earthen lamp while singing devotional songs accompanied by rhythmic clapping of the hands.In Punjab, Navaratri is a period of fasting. In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, a special platform is constructed in homes on which are placed icons, toys and other colourful objects. Friends and relatives are invited for the Bommai Kolu, as the arrangement is called.On the ninth day, people in southern India celebrate Saraswati Puja. All objects of learning like books, stationary, musical instruments and other objects associated with them are placed on a pedestal and worshipped. Since the next day coincides with Vijayadashmi, the books are taken out and read. It is believed that Aksharabhyas is an auspicious day for children to be initiated into learning.","keyword":"[\"navaratri\", \"india\", \"devi\", \"puja\", \"tenth\", \"pray\"]","ALS":"27.055555555555557"},{"english_id":"413","id":"414","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"The Song of Hori or Happiness","article":"Braj mein hori khelat Nandlal.Kesar rang ki keech bhai hai,Chahun or udat gulal,Nachat gopal.Braj mein hori khelat Nandlal.Baajat jhanjhar, dhol, majari aur khartal,Braj ki nari sangh hori khelat,Nachat dede taal, sakhi.Braj mein hori khelat Nandlal.(This song sung by women describes Nandlal, as young Krishna is called, playing hori with the women of Brajbhoomi – the area comprising Mathura, Vrindavan, Gokul and Barsana that are associated with Krishna and Radha. ‘Red colour is flying in all directions and the mud has turned slushy with saffron coloured water. Friend, dance to the beat as Nandlal is playing hori’ – so the song goes.)The Song of Hori or Happiness [Mughal miniature print, courtesy National Museum, New Delhi]Holi – the word was originally hori or happiness in Brajbhasha, a dialect of Hindi language. In fact, in Braj, people still call Holi, Hori. The verse above happens to be the hori, as the song of Holi is called.So how and when did Hori change to Holi? And why did the people call it Hori in the first place?There are many myths surrounding this question and many of them link the festival to Krishna, right from the day this son of Devaki and Vasudev was brought to Gokul as an infant and placed in the care of foster parents. Born in a prison in Mathura during the night, he was taken away by his father to escape the wrath of his uncle, King Kans.Time passed. The people of Gokul had just harvested a good wheat and gram crop – the first of the season. Winter was on its way out, the spring flowers were budding and it was a full moon day. Also, it was the month of chait or the first month of the Hindu year. Since everything around them gave the message of new life and the Nand household had an heir after a long time, the people of Gokul decided to celebrate.So wheat and gram were roasted, flowers of different colours were powdered and the women prepared sweetmeats. There was great singing and dancing to the beats of the dholak (the two-sided drum).This became an annual ritual following the harvest and Hori became a festival. Old timers recount that in Uttar Pradesh, there used to be only two harvests – one in March and the other around July.With time, more and more myths got attached to Holi. It came to symbolise the triumph of good over evil when King Hiranyakashyap decided to burn his son, Prahlad, alive. The king made Prahlad sit on his aunt’s lap in a pyre. His aunt, Holika, had been granted the boon of not burning in fire. However, Holika died, while Prahlad lived, unhurt.Ever since then, the custom of burning Holika began. And Hori got another name – Holi. However, the hori song remained. It still speaks of the boy Krishna, though over a period of time the hori has acquired new shades – from folk to classical and semi-classical styles.","keyword":"[\"hori\", \"holi\", \"khelat\", \"gokul\", \"song\", \"krishna\"]","ALS":"26.045454545454547"},{"english_id":"414","id":"415","level":"5","topic":"9","title":"The Story of Diwali","article":"Deepavali or Diwali as it has come to be known as, means many things to many people. It means holidays from school, shopping expeditions for clothes, sweets, gifts and crackers to children. To the office-goer it means an annual bonus that can make all this happen.To the businessman Diwali means brisk business just as to the clay potter, Diwali is the occasion of the year when the bulk of his sales are made. Diwali has a special significance for the trading communities of India who usher in their new year and new accounting books (‘bahi khata’) during this time.The Story of Diwali [Illustrations by Sudheer Nath and Shiju George]Clearly, Diwali is the most exuberant of all Indian festivals. It is the equivalent of Christmas in the West, and people of each age have added their meanings to the celebration of Diwali.How did Diwali begin?The origins of Diwali lie in ancient India as a festival probably celebrated after an important harvest. It was a good time for the cultivators or vaishyas to celebrate. The granaries were full at the end of a long monsoon, and winter was still to come. They paid off their debts, celebrated and started afresh.Gradually, the vaishyas became landowners and traders and Diwali became a time for them to change their annual accounting books. Their new year started with Diwali.This is the reason why Diwali is also the festival of Goddess Lakshmi, who personifies prosperity and wealth. Lakshmi pujas are held in most Hindu homes, especially in the north.Diwali myths: the end of Rama’s exileOver time, various mythological explanations were given for the celebration of Diwali.The most popular myth among these is the one linked to the ancient prince Rama, his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, returning to their kingdom, Ayodhya, after a 14-year exile, and the defeat of the king of Lanka, Ravana. To celebrate this event, people at Ayodhya are believed to have lit up their houses with lamps.The legend of Dhanavantari: physician of godsAccording to mythology he was the physician of the gods who is believed to have emerged with a pot of ‘amrit’ (nectar) during the ‘samudra manthan’ or the churning of the ocean, when the gods and the demons fought with each other. It is also believed that Lakshmi emerged from the churning of the ocean and, therefore, her worship forms a big part of the Diwali celebrations.South India: the myth of NarasimhaIn South India, the story linked to Diwali is that of Narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu, who is known as the God of Preservation among the Hindu Trinity that is made up of Brahma (the God of Creation) and Shiva (the God of Destruction).According to legend, Vishnu incarnates himself as Narasimha (man-lion) to rid the earth of an evil king Hiranyakshipu. The king had received a boon from Brahma that he could not be conquered by either god or human for the simple reason that he could be killed neither by beast nor man, neither inside nor outside, neither during the day nor at night.When Hiranyakshipu’s atrocities became unbearable, the gods turned to Vishnu for help. Vishnu reincarnated himself as Narasimha, half man and half lion and, therefore, neither man nor beast.As Narasimha, he killed Hiranyakshipu with his claws at the threshold (which is neither inside nor outside), and just before daybreak (a time when it is neither day nor night). That way he managed to get around the boon given to the king.","keyword":"[\"diwali\", \"narasimha\", \"vishnu\", \"hiranyakshipu\", \"lakshmi\", \"myth\"]","ALS":"43.86666666666667"},{"english_id":"415","id":"416","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"The Story of Dussehra","article":"Dussehra, also called Vijayadashmi (or Bijoya in Bengal), is the culmination of the nine-day Navaratri celebrations. It is a festival that marks the killing of Ravana, his son Meghanatha and brother Kumbhakarna, by Rama. It is seen as the vistory of good over evilThe RamayanaThe epic Ramayana, describes the story of Rama. Rama was the exiled prince of the kingdom of Ayodhya. While in exile, he lived in the forest with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana. One day Sita was abducted by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka. Rama, assisted by an army of monkeys and Lakshmana, attacked Lanka to rescue her.Ms Sarah Welch \/ CC BY-SA (https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/4.0)A fierce battle ensued between the two armies for many days. Rama found it very difficult to beat the mighty Ravana. So he prayed for nine days to nine different aspects of goddess Durga and accumulated enough strength to defeat Ravana.Dussehra celebrates Rama’s victory over Ravana in a festival spread out over ten days. The story of Rama’s life is enacted in a folk art form called Ramlila. Every nook and corner has its own Ramlila, with millions of actors enacting it during Dussehra. Conventionally, only men participated in the Ramlila, but now women, too, have started acting in them.The 10th day is one of fireworks. The final act of this drama is staged. Huge paper effigies stuffed with firecrackers, sometimes almost 100 feet high, of Ravana, his son and brother, are set ablaze. At the appointed hour, a person dressed as Rama, shoots flaming arrows at the effigies, which start to burn.The Dussehra of KuluAlthough Dussehra is celebrated across India, in some parts the celebrations are especially interesting. Kulu, a small town in Himachal Pradesh, is witness to unique Dussehra celebrations. Since the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who ruled Punjab (which also consisted of parts of Himachal Pradesh), more than 150 years ago, Dussehra celebrations here begin three days after they do in the rest of India.This is so because the powerful Maharaja expected all kings who paid him homage, to be present at Kulu for the celebration. These rulers would leave immediately after the celebrations in their kingdoms had ended, and head to Kulu. Since it took them three days to reach, this practice was established and has continued ever since.The lives of the hills people are full of fascinating myths that connect the existence of their very human gods to the natural surroundings — beautiful and harsh alternately. At times like Dussehra, then, if the humans celebrate, wouldn’t the gods rejoice too and have their annual reunion?Village deities from all around are brought to Kulu in palanquins. The procession is led by musicians and dancers. A large fair is also organised on this occasion.This is a good opportunity for people to buy and stock their provisions for the harsh winter ahead, as most places become inaccessible due to snow within a month of the festival.The Story of Dussehra []The Grand Dussehra of MysoreIn Mysore in the southern state of Karnataka, the celebrations take a unique turn. Instead of effigies of Ravana being burnt, five animals -a rooster, a fish, a lamb, a crab, and a buffalo – are sacrificed instead.Dussehra is a royal celebration in Mysore. The people of Mysore celebrate Durga Puja, too. They mark Durga’s killing of Mahishasura, who according to myth lived in those parts. The celebrations are held at the Durga temple atop the Chamundi hill, with a breathtaking view. Durga happens to be the family deity of the royal family.A regal procession of decorated elephants, courtiers and court symbols winds its way to the temple, which is decorated splendidly for the festival. On reaching the temple, prayers are offered to the goddess.This event attracts many tourists from India and abroad. But given the expenses involved, it has been a royal affair. Lately though, with the decline in the status of the royal family of Mysore, this festival has lost some of its traditional lustre.The ‘Bommai Kolu’ of Tamil NaduIn Tamil Nadu, Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, Saraswati, the goddess of learning and arts and Shakti (Durga) are worshipped. Here, and in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, families arrange dolls (Bommai Kolu) on specially built steps.

Nearly all cultures celebrate this festival. For instance south Indians celebrate it as Pongal in the month of January, while the north Indians celebrate it as Holi in the month of March.The American act of thanksgiving began during the early pioneer days almost four hundred years ago.In 1620, one hundred people sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to land at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in America. However, their first winter was severe and their crops failed in the new climate and unfamiliar soil. Half of them died due to lack of fresh food.The few who survived were saved as Native Americans of the Iroquois tribe taught them how to grow corn (maize) and other crops, all of which were new food for the settlers.An artist’s impression of native indian thanksgivingIn the next autumn (fall season), 1621, bountiful crops of corn, barley, beans and pumpkins were harvested. The settlers had much to be thankful for, so a feast was planned. They invited the Iroquois chief and his tribe for this feast. The Indians brought turkeys and other wild game for the settlers. And the feast consisted of cranberries, corn turkey and deer, along with dishes taught by the Indians.Each year, the settlers decided to celebrate the autumn harvest with a feast of thanks. In 1776, after the U.S. became independent, the government recommended that a thanksgiving day be held to celebrate the occasion.President George Washington suggested November 26 as Thanksgiving Day. In 1863, the date was shifted by President Abraham Lincoln to the last Thursday in November as a day of thanksgiving. The date was again shifted in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the fourth Thursday of November to lengthen the shopping period before Christmas.However, Thanksgiving falls on a different date each year and the President must proclaim that date as the official celebration.A modern thanksgiving feast includes turkey, pumpkin, cranberries, acorns and more…The thanksgiving feast apart from showing gratitude for a good harvest is in fact a feast planned to thank the Native Americans for teaching the settlers how to grow and cook food.However, by the eighteenth century, the festival lost its initial relevance as these very settlers instead of showing gratitude aplenty to the Native Americans, systematically killed the buffalo and nearly drove it into extinction; and through deceit took over the land, and treacherously decimated the Native American tribes.Without the Native Americans the early settlers would not have survived and the United States, as it is today would not have existed !Today, thanksgiving is a festival of family reunion. Family members gather for a reunion to give thanks for the good things that they have.

First, the area known as Brajbhoomi comprising Mathura, Vrindavan, Govardhan, Gokul (all connected to Lord Krishna’s birth, childhood and early youth) and Barsana (Radha’s village). Here Holi is a robust enactment of the legends of Radha and Krishna.Then there is the Holi of Banaras. The way it is celebrated is the talk of the town and the famous kavi sammelan or poets’ gathering at Banaras is one reason for this. But that happens only in the evening when everyone has finished drenching each other in coloured water and gorged on chips and sweetmeats like gujiya and malpua.Where Holi is the Talk of the Town [Illustration by Anup Singh]It’s a typical Holi day in Village Nuav in Banaras. There’s great excitement in the air. The first thing you hear is the yelling and screeching of children – you see, they have taken sunrise as the signal to begin their drenching drill.Soon, the families in the neighbourhood gather outside and within minutes, everyone makes sure that no one looks like himself or herself any more. What with all the gulal or dry coloured powder that they put on each other – red, yellow, green, blue, orange, pink – and the water squirts, they look like rainbows from head to toe!A little later, it’s time to play Holi with the rest of the village and the women head towards a nearby ground. Men, too, go off towards the temple to sing the hori or the special Holi song and dance to the beats of the dholak or the two-sided drum.A little after noon, it’s time to do the rounds again. The womenfolk are back in their houses. The men visit each house in the village by turn and there is more singing and dancing. The guests are hungry with all the excitement. The lady of the house serves them gujiyas and malpua. And what do they drink? Why, what else but bhang or a homemade drink made with the leaves of the bhang plant that has an intoxicating effect! No Holi is celebrated without bhang in northern India.Krishna and Radha Celebrating the Holi Festival with Companions.

Well, it is a village custom that everyone pokes fun at the mama, forces him to wear this ‘garland’ and parade the whole village on a donkey!But the mama does not feel bad about this. On Holi, everyone takes a joke in the spirit of this festival. Holi is the day when the world turns ‘upside down’. On this one day all hierarchies are suspended, and people in authority willingly become the butt of all ridicule. Women too use Holi to batter men – quite literally.This is also the reason behind the sammelan in the city. Since there is no mama whom everyone knows, the poets instead poke fun at the local politicians – everyone knows them, you see!The sammelan is a strictly male affair. Dressed in their new clothes, the men – young and old alike – gather at Beniya Bagh. The municipality makes the arrangements well in advance and as always, it is a big function. Everyone has a chance to say what he wants and needless to say, no one passes up the opportunity to poke fun at the politicians.

It is October and it’s Halloween time!Halloween is celebrated on the evening of October 31st, which is the evening before the Christian feast of All Saint’s Day. Halloween’s history goes back to the ancient religion of the Celtic tribes (circa 500 B.C.) from whom came the Britons, Scots and the Irish. Present day Britains, Scots, Welsh and Irish are all descendants from these ancient Celtic tribes.The Celts worshipped nature and believed in the spirit world. They worshipped over 300 gods. Their chief god was the sun and they celebrated two festivals revolving around the sun: Beltane, to mark the beginning of summer and Samhain or Saman to mark the start of winter.Why is Halloween Celebrated?The Celts believed that at the end of summer, Samhain, the lord of death becomes powerful and overpowers the sun god. On October 31, Samhain assembles all the evil spirits who had died the previous year and allows them to return home to visit the living.On October 31, after the harvest, the druids would meet under an oak grove or near large stone circles where they performed sacrifices. Some believe that the Stonehenge in England is one such druid circle. The priests would light great fires and offer sacrifices to Samhain to ensure that the sun returned after the winter.During the night all fires except the sacrificial one to Samhain were extinguished. The Vigil of Samhain, as it was called, would keep the sacrificial fire on through the night and the next day embers from this fire would be used to light the fire in each household.Villagers would try to appease goblins and demons with offerings of food and nuts. They would leave little treats that the household had to offer, to satisfy the hunger of these demons. If the demon was satisfied with the treat, it was believed it would not trick the person or cast an evil spell. Therein lies the origin of the present day trick or treat.Why is Halloween Celebrated?Legend has it that people would also wear masks or other disguises and blacken their faces to try and pass unnoticed by the spirits. This stemmed from the belief that ghosts or spirits cannot see their own reflection. Hence, if a goblin or demon saw another creature looking suitably horrible, they would run away in terror.After the Romans conquered Britian in 61 A.D., they brought with them their own harvest festival held on November 1, to honor Pomona, goddess of the fruits of trees. Over the years, the two festivals got mixed up and became one long holiday.In 834 A.D., Pope Gregory III shifted the festival of All Saints Day, then celebrated on May 13 to November 1. The new day was called All Saints Day or Hallowmas. Thus, the evening and night before it became All Hallow’s eve and later Halloween.The Celtic concept of ghosts and witches became blended with Roman and later Christian customs. In Ireland and Britain, Halloween was also celebrated as Mischief Night when villagers were allowed to play pranks on each other.Traces of the Roman Pomona festival such as ducking for apples in a tub of water still survive. Another is the use of hollowed-out pumpkins lit by candles in the belief that it would ward off evil spirits.Why is Halloween Celebrated?Today, Halloween is a festival of fun for kids. An occasion to dress up as little monsters, ghosts or witches. Over time the custom of adults dressing up as demons changed and the children took over. As they went from house to house they would knock at each house and cry “trick or treat”. People would then give the children apples or buns and later candy to keep from being tricked.However, since the 1960s, various crimes have been committed during Halloween. There have been cases of candy laced with drugs.Other incidents such as older children attacking younger children to steal their candy, or children finding razor blades or pieces of glass in their treats have also been reported. Increasingly parents and local police and administrative officials issue safety tips for children when they go trick or treating.","keyword":"[\"halloween\", \"samhain\", \"trick\", \"demon\", \"ghost\", \"candy\"]","ALS":"29.037037037037038"},{"english_id":"423","id":"424","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"Winter Festivals around the World","article":"In two weeks it will be the winter solstice (literally means sun standing still) when we have the shortest day and the longest night.

Legend has it that on their return to Jerusalem, the Maccabees found only a little bottle of oil to light the temple menorah (a lamp or candle stand) that was not even enough to last a few hours.However, when they temple menorah was lit, a miracle occurred and the menorah burned for eight days. Since then, the Jewish people have been celebrating the success of the Maccabees and the miracle of the oil.During the Hanukkah festival, the family gathers around the menorah, a special candle stand to hold eight candles. On the first night the head of the family uses another candle – called a shamos – to help him light one candle of the menorah. On the second night, two candles are lit. This goes on until all the eight candles are lit.Each night, gifts and presents are exchanged. Children play games with a small four-sided wooden top called a dreidel.

It is a group of genetic disorders that makes it difficult for the body to stop cuts bleeding. The cells that the body needs to clot blood are missing. Hemophilia is a hereditary disease and so it is passed down through generations. The gene that creates the disorder comes from the mother and is passed almost entirely to male babies. When hemophiliacs get a cut, the bleeding lasts much longer than in normal people. Even a small cut can bleed for weeks, and in some cases cuts may never heal.

They can enjoy watching the top actors on Broadway or London’s West End, or simply watch their local amateur dramatics production.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"theatre\", \"performing\", \"actor\", \"watch\", \"greek\", \"enjoy\"]","ALS":"16.75"},{"english_id":"463","id":"464","level":"5","topic":"2","title":"World Tuberculosis Day","article":"World Tuberculosis Day falls on March 24th each year. It is sponsored by the World Health Organisation. Its aim is to raise global awareness that tuberculosis is still an epidemic in many parts of the world. Many people in rich countries believe the disease has largely been wiped out. This is untrue. Tuberculosis (TB) kills over 1.6 million people each year. Almost all deaths are in the world’s poorest nations. March 24th is the day when Dr. Robert Koch made the discovery of the cause of tuberculosis in 1882. He identified the TB bacillus. In the late nineteenth century, TB was a major killer, responsible for the deaths of 15 per cent of the populations of America and Europe. Dr. Koch's discovery helped find a cure for TB.\n\nTuberculosis is a disease that is spread through the air. It is preventable and curable, if people can get access to the right medicine. In rich countries, babies have injections to give them lifelong protection from TB. Babies in poorer countries are not as lucky. Over 1.5 million people died from TB in 2006. People who catch the disease have the TB bacillus in their lungs. They spread the disease when they cough, making it highly contagious. The symptoms of tuberculosis are a terrible cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The disease can also seriously affect other body organs. The WHO is working to halve the number of TB deaths by 2015.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"tuberculosis\", \"disease\", \"koch\", \"discovery\", \"bacillus\", \"cough\"]","ALS":"12.909090909090908"},{"english_id":"467","id":"468","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"A Fish with Three Hearts: Cuttlefish","article":"It is said to be a royal among sea animals because it has blue blood, literally.

They are called the cephalopods, which literally translated means head-foot.The blood of the cuttlefish is blue because of the huge amount of copper in it. While it uses two of its hearts to pump blood into the gills (the lung of the fish) where it absorbs oxygen, the third heart pumps blood into the other organs.Cuttlefish swimming in oceanWith their flattened bodies, cuttlefish are well suited to life on the sea bed, where they hunt for molluscs and small fish. They have a chalky internal shell called cuttlebone that often gets washed ashore. The cuttlebone has a use: it is fed to canaries and parrots.The cuttlefish is a master at camouflage; it can change its colour to match its background and hide from its predators. This is done by adjusting the size of the pigment sacs in its skin.The pigment sacs are small bags in which the cuttlefish carries several colours. If the attacking animal still manages to detect the cuttlefish, it ejects a black liquid blinding the attacker temporarily while it escapes.","keyword":"[\"cuttlefish\", \"cuttlebone\", \"blood\", \"heart\", \"pigment\", \"pump\"]","ALS":"26.88888888888889"},{"english_id":"474","id":"475","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"An Earth Day Fable","article":"Indians are masters of junk. And out of junk they produce masterpieces. One such junk master is the sculptor Nek Chand who fashioned his sculptures from waste. The story goes that Nek chand was once invited to America to fashion sculptures, works of art out of waste. Nek Chand came back disillusioned and glum complaining that their junk was not so good, that its feel and smell was so alien.If Nek Chand turned masterpieces out of junk (see picture below), the slum is a craft built around junk. Every citizen of a slum is a master of recycling. As an Indian scientist once put it “waste is the only resource of a wasted people”. For a slum, one man’s waste is another man’s lifestyle. We were masters of recycling long before it became fashionable.But, sometimes, our art forms become lethally ironic. This becomes clearest in our relation to plastic. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), New Delhi, India’s growth rate of plastic is the highest in the world. Like a virus, plastics have infiltrated every sector of the economy, from agriculture and telecommunications to consumer goods.An Earth Day FableYet, what is intriguing is the way we delay the disposal of plastic waste. Unlike in the west, we happily use it the second and a third time. The recycling industry in India is a Rs. 2000-crore economy. Accompanying it is a network of rag pickers and waste collectors. The figures speak for themselves. If Europe recycles seven per cent of its plastic waste, China 10 and Japan 12 per cent, India recycles 60 per cent of its plastic waste.Parivesh, the CPCB bulletin even talks of a new type of worker — the plastic mechanic who repairs buckets by fusing them. If English newspapers sell at Rs. 4 or Rs. 5 a kg and beer bottles at Rs. 2.50 per kg, plastic waste sells at Rs. 12-15 per kg. The tragedy begins here.Recycling of plastic waste only postpones the problem of disposal; it does not solve them. One has to visit Delhi’s Mundka village to understand this.Mundka is a village, which collects waste from hospitals. Here one sees waste mounds of glucose bottles, urinary bags, surgical gloves and syringes. All these are one-time use items which must be crushed and disposed of. But here everything is collected and recycled. A full cottage industry has grown around the use of such waste. The rag picker who is the hero of recycling becomes the villain of the fable.Worse still, once plastics are reused they are abandoned by the ragpicker. Take plastic bags. Once they are recycled, they have little economic value. They are completely ignored by the kabadiwala and condemned along with a mineral water bottle. The CPCB claims that they are littered in dumps and eventually choke up our sewers and storm water drains. The question we must ask on Earth Day – Is all recycling healthy?Or is one man’s recycling another man’s death warrant? Ecology is full of such ironies.The writer is a well-known anthropologist.","keyword":"[\"waste\", \"plastic\", \"recycle\", \"junk\", \"chand\", \"slum\"]","ALS":"16.194444444444443"},{"english_id":"482","id":"483","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"Birds Sing in their Sleep","article":"Just like humans, birds too rely on sound to communicate. However, they do not have a ‘language’ in the true sense of the word and instead emit a variety of squawks and chirps to convey different emotions.Often, birds recognise their mates (or young) by sound rather than sight. Hungry fledglings use begging calls to let their mothers know it is feeding time. Alarm calls, flight calls for flight coordination, and warning calls are other sounds emitted frequently by the adults.In addition to all these regular calls, some male birds develop elaborate songs intended to attract the females. Some feathered pairs keep in touch through duets; the female bird answers the male’s call so promptly, that the duet sounds as if a single bird has sung it!Believe it or not, but birds can pick out the call of a potential mate among thousands of other birdcalls and other natural sounds.A new study carried out by an American University shows that songbirds are perfectionists – they rehearse their melodies even in their sleep. The new finding emerged from a study of the electrical brain activity of a species of Australian songbirds called the zebra finches.Many birds recognize their mothers by sound rather than sight.The research team discovered that the activity in the brain of the birds that were asleep was similar to the brain activity produced when the birds were awake and singing.The team used tiny recording devices to measure the activity of individual brain cells in four zebra finches both when they were singing and when they were asleep.When the recording was played back the nerve cells’ activity (of the sleeping bird) was identical to that which accompanied singing, although the bird produced no sound.Apparently the bird stores a song after hearing it, then rehearses it later in its sleep. Scientists now believe the birds ‘dream of songs and tunes’ to help them master the fine art of singing and that sleep plays a key role in the learning process!It is commonly known that many songbirds learn to sing listening to adult birds of the same species. However, if separated from the adults, the chicks develop unintelligible warbles instead of normal song patterns.If taught the song of an adult of another bird species, the chick grows up singing the new song and passes on the foreign song to its chick.For instance, researchers carried out an experiment in which a male bullfinch was raised by a female canary. The bullfinch soon learned the canary’s song and when it was later mated to a female bullfinch, Mr. Bullfinch taught his children the canary’s songs.Early last year, a British survey of London’s songbirds revealed that the city’s birds are losing their melody. The research team noticed that birds like the cuckoo and the woodchuck had harsher songs with fewer notes and tones.They soon realised that birds could hardly hear one another, over the traffic din; as a result they had difficulty in learning songs and communicating with potential mates.And instead of copying the sweet notes of the adults, chicks were imitating sounds, which they heard most often – namely blaring car horns and beeping cellular phones!","keyword":"[\"song\", \"bird\", \"bullfinch\", \"songbird\", \"activity\", \"sleep\"]","ALS":"57.6"},{"english_id":"485","id":"486","level":"5","topic":"2","title":"Can Frog Fly?","article":"You must have seen frogs that jump, but have you seen frogs that can fly?

Animals must constantly go in search of food. But plants remain fixed at one place. Some plants make their own food by using energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to make sugar.Green leaves of the plants contain chlorophyll that carry out this process called photosynthesis. But a large number of plants are unable to produce their own food because of the absence of chlorophyll. These plants, therefore, feed on other plants or dead animals.Plants that feed on other plants are called ‘parasites’. Those plants that feed on dead organic matter are called ‘saprophytes’. Saprophytes play an important role in the decay process by digesting and absorbing nutrients from dead material. All fungi and bacteria are saprophytes and they cannot produce food through photosynthesis. Some of the flowering plants are also saprophytes.True fungi are mushrooms, toadstools, truffles, rusts, mildew and bread moulds. Mould is a collective name given to fungi that are not mushrooms. The fur moulds are sometimes seen on bread or vegetables. They grow on these food items and secrete an enzyme to break down the food into tiny parts that they can easily absorb.Some plants are parasites. That is, they do not make food on their own but get water, minerals and food from other plants. Parasitic plants may or may not have chlorophyll. Plants like the mistletoe have green leaves and make some of their own food and take only water and minerals from the host plant through specially developed roots, which secure the parasite to the host and grow into the host’s stem.Dodder (Cuscuta americana) is a parasitic climberTrue parasites such as dodders, which is a kind of morning glory, and cuscuta, are entirely devoid of chlorophyll and rely entirely on the host for food. Others like the mistletoe and rafflesia are partial parasites. Some are parasites of the stem and others attach themselves to the root.The mistletoe can only grow if its seeds are left on branches or tree trunks. When the seeds sprout it sends a single root that ends up as a sucker (or sucking mechanism). It slowly enters the host tree and eventually may surround an entire branch.When a dodder seed germinates, the young plant begins to grow in a circular fashion, searching for a mother plant. Once it gets a host, the thin stem of this plant twines around the host’s stem and starts taking food from the host. Broomrape and figwort are parasites of the root.Rafflesia keithii is a parasitic flowering plant. These flowers are considered to be among the largest in the world and can grow up to one metre in diameter.The most remarkable parasite plant is the rafflesia found in Southeast Asia. One species of this plant, the Rafflesia arnoldii found only in Sumatra, grows the largest flower which is over three feet across and weighs up to seven kg. Its flowers are purplish red and the entire flower can be smelt a mile away as it gives a distinct smell of rotting flesh! Though it grows large flowers, its roots and stems are small as it grows right on the forest floor attaching itself to roots of vines.","keyword":"[\"plant\", \"parasite\", \"host\", \"food\", \"chlorophyll\", \"saprophyte\"]","ALS":"23.115384615384617"},{"english_id":"487","id":"488","level":"5","topic":"2","title":"Can Two People have Identical Fingerprints?","article":"I was once watching a detective serial on T.V. where the fingerprints of the suspect are required. The hero invites the villain to his home and offers him a glass of water. The bad guy takes the glass and drinks the water from it. After he leaves the hero dramatically whips out a handkerchief and picks up the glass. His expressions showed that satisfaction at a job well done.At that time, I found it amazing – how can smudges on a glass identify people? How can my hand be different from yours – apart from the size that is? It was only after my dad explained me the reason that the mystery behind that highly dramatic scene became clear.Scanning human fingerprint for a Biometric identification systemMy dad explained that if you were to press your thumb on an inkpad and then on a sheet of white paper you will leave a smudge or print, which no one else in the world can make. The same would be true for each of your fingers. The Chinese were the first to use fingerprints to affix their signature on important documents though they had no way of identifying or matching it with the owner.If you look closely at the inside of your palm you can see tiny lines all over. These are absolutely unique and they remain practically unchanged from birth to death.Each print is one-of-a-kind and no two people have the same characteristic. Scientists and criminologists (those who study criminal characteristics) determine the individuality of a fingerprint by a careful study of its ridge characteristics (minutiae) and not by its general shape or pattern.The surface of the skin has been designed to provide our bodies with a firm grasp and to prevent objects grasped from slipping. Skin is composed of layers of cells. The outer portion of skin is called the epidermis while the inner skin is the dermis. Separating the two layers is a boundary of cells called the papillae.Each skin ridge has a single row of pores that open out for the sweat glands. Once the finger touches a surface, sweat from these pores, along with other body oils layer the ridge of the skin and are thus transferred to that surface. The result is an impression of the finger’s ridge pattern. Such prints are referred to as hidden fingerprints because they are invisible to the naked eye.How this fact was discovered and now used by the police force worldwide is very interesting to trace. In 1823, John Evangelist Purkinji, a professor of anatomy at the University of Breslau in Czechoslovakia, published the first document on the nature of fingerprints.In 1856, Sir William Herschel, who was then working for the Indian Civil Service in West Bengal, used thumbprints on documents as a substitute for signatures. In 1880, a British physician Henry Faulds, who was then working in Tokyo, published a paper suggesting that fingerprints left at the scene of a crime could identify the offender. However, Faulds never got the credit he deserved!In 1892, an English scientist, Sir Francis Galton, published a comprehensive book on using fingerprints to solve crimes. At the same time in Argentina, a police researcher Juan Vucetich was also working towards a fingerprint classification system.However, it was in 1896 that Sir Edward Richard Henry, then serving as Inspector General of Police in Jalpaiguri district in West Bengal, India, developed a print classification system that will come to be used globally.Sir Henry and his assistant Khan Bahadur Azizul Haque, discovered that all fingerprints could be systematically classified according to their general ridge patterns. He divided them into three classes on the basis of their general pattern: loops, whorls, and arches.By counting the ridges between any two points in the pattern, each of the ten fingers could be classified into a particular group. Taking the group together as a unit you have a complete system of classifying fingerprints.In June 1897, the world’s first fingerprint bureau was set up in Calcutta and in 1901, Sir Edward Richard Henry was appointed head of Scotland Yard in London, where he implemented the system there. This system, called dactyloscopy or the science of fingerprint identification, is still used by police departments all over the world today with few changes.It works so well that fingerprints can be filed away by these groups, instead of by the name or description of the criminal. Even though millions of prints may be on the file in an office, the right one can be picked out in just a few minutes.Today, technology has improved so much that from even half a print, scientists can identify and match it with the prints in their files and today, fingerprints can be ‘lifted’ from most any surface, not just glass!","keyword":"[\"fingerprint\", \"ridge\", \"print\", \"henry\", \"glass\", \"police\"]","ALS":"33.30769230769231"},{"english_id":"488","id":"489","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"Can You Speak Dolphin Language?","article":"Mastering a language is not an easy task.

Both the clicks and whistles serve a definite purpose – the clicking noises help in echo-location while the whistles are their method of communicating their emotions.Dolphins communicate with each other by whistling, but strictly speaking, there is no evidence, yet, to prove that the whistles are as complex as human languages.

And they all have developed interesting ways to keep them at bay. Some animals hide, others run, or just fly away when faced with danger. These are their defence mechanisms.Some animals can hide without moving. They have the unique ability to change their colour to merge with the surroundings. They become invisible to the predator. This method of defence is called “camouflage”.Some rabbits change colour with the change of season. The snowshoe hare is brown in summer and white in winter. The white fur serves as a camouflage in the snow in winter.Many non-poisonous snakes take on colours similar to poisonous snakes in order to scare off enemies. This form of defence is called mimicry. Some poisonous snakes have very bright colours to warn enemies that it is near. This form of defence is called “warning colouration”.Fishes use another form of camouflage called counter-shading. The underside of most fishes is of a lighter shade than the top. The deeper colour on the top helps it merge with the shadows it makes.There is a kind of fish called the puffer fish which uses an extraordinary device to keep predators away. It swells up like a balloon when it is attacked. Then, its attacker finds it difficult to swallow it.Puffer fish can take in large amounts of water to swell up like a balloon making it very difficult for its attacker to swallow it.Animals which cannot protect themselves in these ways develop other means to do so.

They get their ignoble name because the females commonly eat their mates after mating (as is common among spiders) and hence are often widows. They comprise about six species and inhabit warmer regions of the world.Shiny black in colour with a reddish hourglass shape on the underside of her spherical abdomen, the female black widow is about one inch long. The male is about half her size and may have a pair of reddish stripes on the side of his abdomen.They are commonly found on the underside of ledges, rocks, plants and debris, wherever a web can be strung.The webs that the black widows spin lack shape and form. Though the webs are erratic in appearance, the silk is stronger than almost all other arachnids.The diet of the black widow consists of insects, spiders and centipedes. After ensnaring the prey in the web, the black widow makes small punctures in the victim’s body and sucks out the liquid contents.Adult male black widow spiders are rarely seen because the female usually eats them after mating.The adult male black widows are harmless with smaller bodies and longer legs. They are often found wandering in search of females and do not bite or prey on other spiders. They are very rarely seen because the female usually eats them after mating.The female lays several eggs in batches, each containing upto 750 eggs each in one summer. The egg case about half an inch in diameter is suspended in the web. It is pear shaped, white to tan in colour and has a paper-like texture. The young black widows are coloured orange and white when they emerge one to four weeks later. The female black widows may live for more than a year-and-a-half.The black widows prefer to nest near the ground, in the dark undisturbed areas. Nest sites are often near holes produced by small animals or around construction openings and wood piles. The females are shy and nocturnal in habit. They rarely leave their web but will bite if threatened. They are also prone to bite when guarding an egg sac. The bite itself is often not painful and may go unnoticed. But the poison from a widow bite can cause abdominal pain producing cramping and nausea. The black widows inject a toxin that affects the nervous system. Muscle and chest pain or tightness are some of the most common reactions to the widow toxin.Other general symptoms include restlessness, anxiety, breathing and speech difficulty.Only the bite of female, usually the adult female is potentially dangerous.

The company has proposed to transform equipments installed in huge C-130 military transport planes for laying carpets of landmines across combat zones, to plant trees in barren areas.A company named Areal Forestation Inc. has already been set up to market the idea. According to a spokesperson at Lockheed,“There are 2,500 C-130 planes in 70 countries, so the delivery system for planting forests is widely available as most planes are lying in military hangers, waiting for someone to hire them.”The promoters believe that with the new planting system, almost 900,000 young trees can be planted in a day. The possiblities are amazing as planes can fly at 1,000 feet, planting more than 3,000 trees cones a minute in a pattern across the landscape. Each cone contains a sapling and that’s around 900,000 trees in a day.The tree cones are pointed and designed to bury themselves in the ground at a uniform depth as if they had been planted by hand. They contain fertilisers and a material that soaks up surrounding moisture, watering the roots of the tree. The containers are made of a kind of metal that biogrades immediately so that the tree can put its roots into the soil.Agricultural aircraft are used for hydroseeding. Here an an agricultural aircraft, sometimes called a spray plane or crop duster, applies chemicals to a field of crops.The argument is – a man on the ground can only plant 1,000 trees a day so if we are to combat global warming, airborne planting is probably the only way. It is believed that the system will work in any area that used to contain trees and even in deserts.We can take comfort in the fact that new forests have been ‘grown’. But there is not much awareness of the harm such manipulated forests can cause to depleted ecosystems.Replacement trees are less able to resist drought, cold, pests and diseases because they grow only in a specific type of land, and not in the complex forest ecosystems that have evolved naturally over the years.The question is – what should be done?Should we plant trees? Yes, of course, plant billions.

An image of a gaping mouth with rows of razor-sharp teeth and a greyish white shark thrashing around in murky water, grappling with its catch.Great White Shark f ending at Guadalupe Island MexicoSharks are the most misunderstood creatures on earth and myths and rumours have spun a web of terror around this predatory carnivore. For centuries people have labelled sharks as man-eaters, lurking undersea for an unsuspecting swimmer to appear. The presence of a shark’s dorsal fin cause waves of fear and panic resulting in bathers and surfers scuttling for shore.There are about 380 known species of sharks, ranging from 20-centimeter lantern sharks to the massive 12-metre long (but harmless) whale sharks. However, truth is, most sharks are timid creatures. They are curious and may come to inspect you but they are as frightened of you as you are of them.The diet of great white sharks consists of turtles, seals, penguins, dolphins, and other fish. But sadly enough, the six-metre long Great White shark, has gained notoriety as the most dangerous shark alive today!So, are sharks really dangerous? The answer is yes and no. There have been attacks on humans by great white sharks but they are not potential man-eaters. Also, they do not spend their time scouring the sea for humans. If they did that, there would be many more fatalities. The fact is, only about one-third of shark attacks have been fatal while in the remaining cases, victims have survived!Attacks on humans occur only when the shark feels threatened or lacks its usual prey. Most of the times they mistake splashing swimmers (the kicking and thrashing resembles the movements of an injured prey to the shark) causing the sharks to investigate. The panic reaction of frightened swimmers leads to an attack.Sometimes the presence of blood in water also causes shark attacks. The presence of other sharks at the site excites them to a feeding frenzy. This often causes attacks on each other and injured sharks (regardless of their size) get devoured by the others!Sharks have an acute sense of smell and hearing. They can detect a drop of blood dissolved in over one million gallons of water. Sharks do not have external ears, instead, sharks detect sound through the hundreds of pores along the side of the shark’s body that are highly sensitive to wave movements, pressure changes and vibrations in the water up to over two kilometres away.Great White Shark breaching for attack – jumps out of water with open mouthGreat white sharks are found in warm coastal waters and have sighted on every continent except Antarctica. The maximum number of great whites are found off the Australian and South African coasts, sometimes coming in very close to the beach.Adult female sharks reach maturity between 14 and 16 years of age and can reach 7 meters in length. Males generally mature around 10-12 years of age and can grow to over five meters. Female great white sharks are ovoviviparous – which means they hatch eggs inside their bodies and give birth to live young sharks (unlike birds that bear eggs and then hatch them).The embryo takes just over six months to develop and the mother shark takes another six months to give birth. Baby sharks are born in litters of between seven and nine and they are between 120 and 150 cm long.Unfortunately, these sharks are commercially hunted. The situation is so drastic that North American biologists recently published a paper (after years of extensive study) stating that great white sharks should be labelled ‘endangered’ and stricter measures be taken to protect the species.Biologists say that great white sharks are in danger of extinction, primarily due to over-fishing, pollution and destruction of their habitat. Also since the great white shark is slow to reach maturity, the number of fish capable of breeding is very less, leading to lowered population growth.Nobody is quite sure what the real population of great white sharks is, but researchers say that approximately 100 million great sharks are killed each year, many for their fins alone! The dorsal fins are highly relished by the Chinese and shark fin soup is a delicacy in South-East Asia. The fins fetch up to $90 a kilogram in Singapore and Hong Kong.This hunting and killing of sharks, particularly the great white, has forced the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) to tag the species as ‘vulnerable’ or critically endangered. This means that they face the risk of extinction in the near future.So why are sharks hunted? Many humans use certain parts of the great white sharks in rituals, and of course, for food. Almost every inch of the shark is valued. Its liver yields an oil, rich in Vitamin A. The shark’s tough skin is used to make luxurious leather, while the flesh is sold, over the counter, at butcher shops!Sharks play an important ecological role in oceans. Just like the carnivorous animals on land help in keeping the herd healthy, sharks too prey on sick and weak animals under sea to keep the ocean ecosystem healthy.And the commercial hunting of sharks has really endangered the life of the creature, which in the longer run can really harm the ocean food chain.","keyword":"[\"shark\", \"white\", \"attack\", \"swimmer\", \"endanger\", \"surfer\"]","ALS":"32.03125"},{"english_id":"517","id":"518","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"High-tech Crane Migration","article":"As winter sets in, millions of birds leave their nests in the northern hemisphere and head towards warmer lands in the south. During spring, they once again wing their way back to their original nesting grounds. This yearly ritual is known as migration.While some birds are great travellers, flying from one country to another; others merely flap down from the high mountains to sheltered valleys for the winter. The Arctic tern (of North America) is the hardiest traveller of all. Each year, these birds fly as far south as Antarctica and back, covering a mind-boggling distance of 29,000 kms.Most migratory birds travel along well-defined flight paths that often follow either the coastline or the sea currents. Research shows that birds who migrate by day judge direction by the angle of the sun, while night travellers steer by star patterns. But the actual manner by which the birds convert what they see, into navigational aids, remains a mystery.Migratory birds often suffer drastic losses en route – while some fall prey to predators, others die of exhaustion. American wildlife experts are now attempting a unique experiment, which they hope will establish a safe (and easier) migration route for endangered whooping cranes.A distinctive long-necked bird with a white body, black wing tips and a red crown, the whooping crane stands about 4.5 feet tall and has a 6.5-foot wingspan. It is the tallest North American bird.It is estimated that there are barely 411 whooping cranes left (of which only one migratory flock exists, moving between the Northwest areas of Canada and USA). Experts say another migratory flock is needed to ensure the crane’s survival in the wild.However, instead of risking experimentation with whooping cranes, scientists have chosen a species of cranes, called sandhill cranes, which are plentiful and have similar characteristics to whooping cranes.Sandhill Cranes in flight at sunsetThese sandhill cranes are ordinary birds with a slight modification in their upbringing – they have been hatched and raised with aircraft noise constantly in the background. A pilot is leading a flock of sandhill cranes as they wing their way from the eastern US state of Wisconsin to the south-eastern state of Florida. (Believe it or not, but the pilot is dressed to look like a giant crane and bird puppets are attached to the aircraft).Cranes fly in a V formation to conserve energy. Except for the bird right in front; each bird in the formation gets an added push from the air currents created by the bird ahead. With a plane leading the way, the cranes are still flying in a V-formation with the flock leader flapping close to the plane’s wingtip – close enough get a push from the air currents generated by the plane.If the experiment succeeds, and the sandhill cranes cover the 1,500 km-long migration route, it could help establish a migratory flock of rare whooping cranes in the eastern United States too.","keyword":"[\"crane\", \"bird\", \"flock\", \"whoop\", \"sandhill\", \"migratory\"]","ALS":"38.07142857142857"},{"english_id":"518","id":"519","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"High-tech Turtle","article":"A few months ago, a turtle in Thailand was grievously injured when it was run over by a truck. The animal hardly seemed to have any chance of survival. However, with the immediate help of the Thai Animal Guardians Association, it did survive. The Association admitted the turtle to Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University for medical treatment.The plucky little survivor was named Jikko and the Bangkok Post (a local newspaper) kept readers updated on the animal’s progress. According to veterinarian Nantarika Chansue, Jikko is now quite fit and a fibre-glass shell has been placed over its broken outer shell to speed up the healing process.This means that Jikko is the only turtle in Thailand (and possibly in the world) to have a fibre-glass shell! This artificial shell is made from denture plate material and would crack and fall off when the natural shell is fully restored.More about turtle and tortoise shellsTurtles and tortoises are reptiles, both easily identifiable by their shells. The fossils of these animals date back to the Triassic period (about 245 million years ago). This means that these reptiles existed even before the first dinosaur groups emerged (the oldest one dates back to 200 million years ago). Turtle (and tortoise) shell is made up of a series of bony plates covered with a horny shield. Although the shell is hard, it is a surprisingly sensitive structure because of the many nerves embedded in it.Contrary to popular belief, it is impossible for the animals to crawl out of their shells. This is so because their vertebrae and ribs are attached firmly to the inside of their shells, providing additional support.So what is the difference between turtles and tortoises? Well, turtles have a relatively flattened shell and live in water, whereas tortoises have a dome-shaped shell and live on land.Turtles found in freshwater are called terrapins. They are quite different from marine turtles (like the leatherback and the Olive Ridley) as their legs have webbing and claws. (Marine turtles have limbs that are modified as flippers). The leatherback is the largest living turtle that can attain a weight of about 540 kilograms! The giant tortoise, Geochelone elephantopus (found on the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador) is the largest species of tortoise.","keyword":"[\"shell\", \"turtle\", \"tortoise\", \"jikko\", \"bangkok\", \"thailand\"]","ALS":"26"},{"english_id":"522","id":"523","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"How Did Pencils Originate?","article":"Not many people know that the pencil they use everyday can trace its history back 2000 years! Early writers, or scribes as they were called, of ancient Egypt, Rome and Greece wrote on forms of paper called papyrus.They used a stylus which was a metal rod made of lead. That is why we still call the black core of the pencil as “lead” even though it is made from graphite!Graphite was discovered sometime in the 16th century in England. Legend has it that people found bits of shiny, black graphite clinging to the roots of a fallen tree. The whole countryside was abuzz with talk about this mysterious mineral, which soon came to be known as “plumbago” or, more commonly, “Blacklead.”Graphite left a dark mark, making it ideal for use by writers and artists. But it was so soft and brittle that it required a holder. At first, sticks of graphite were wrapped in string. Later, the graphite was inserted into wooden sticks that had been hollowed-out by hand! The wood-cased pencil was born.Graphite, was discovered in the 16th century. People found that graphite could be used to write on paper. But graphite was very soft and would break easily. People would wrap it with twine or string so that they could hold it to write.Strings were not very efficient and sometimes came undone when writing. Someone then thought of taking two pieces of wood and tying it on both sides of the graphite and tying it with strings.Much later it was found that wooden pieces could be drilled through and the graphite inserted within. Thus, the humble pencil was born.Pencils soon came to be produced commercially. In 1662, Germany started manufacturing pencils. These were highly polished pieces of wood and unpainted.As more and more manufacturers started making pencils, they needed some way to distinguish the makers of the pencils. By the end of the 19th century, the wood casings began to carry the manufacturer’s name.Commercially manufactured common yellow pencils.Early American pencils were made from Cedar. Cedar wood, either red cedar or incense cedar was used as the wood was strong and didn’t break easily. Later pencils were made from tropical rainforest trees.However, pencils are no longer made from wood as forests are getting depleted and trees are getting scarce. Most pencils today are woodfree or are made from plastic.The inside of a pencil or the ‘writing core’ is made with a mixture of graphite and clay. By varying the ratio of graphite or clay, manufacturers can increase or decrease the “hardness” of the core.The hardness of the core is often marked on the pencil in numbers and with alphabets. The higher the number the harder the writing core like 2, 3 or HB. The letter “H” indicates a hard pencil and the letter “B” indicates the blackness of the pencil’s mark. So a pencil marked “HB” means it is hard and black; a pencil marked “HH” is very hard but light. The letter “F” indicates that the pencil sharpens to a fine point.Some pencils come with small erasers attached to its back. Earlier erasers were not part of the pencil. In 1858, Hyman Lipman of Philadelphia filed a patent to attach erasers to pencils. These small erasers are called plugs and these are crimped on to the pencil in the factory itself. These erasers are not true rubber at all but made from synthetic rubber or vinyl.Pencils are useful in more ways than one. For one, they can write 40,000 words or draw a line, if you are interested, for 70 kilometres! They can write in zero gravity, or even under water! So if you ever decide to go scuba diving or take a space walk and have an urgent desire to write something, be sure to have a pencil in your pocket.","keyword":"[\"pencil\", \"graphite\", \"eraser\", \"cedar\", \"write\", \"wood\"]","ALS":"22.53125"},{"english_id":"523","id":"524","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"How Did Santa Claus Originate?","article":"Its nearly midnight and with a jingle of bells a sled comes streaking from the north, pulled of course by Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.

Its Christmas and its Santa Claus. If you’ve been nice, he slides down the chimney and loads up little stockings hung there with lots of toys and goodies. If you’ve been naughty, then you get fewer toys!Well, this is what everybody believes and all kids look forward to Christmas.Santa Claus was originally Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a bishop who lived in the 4th century in the city of Myra in Asia Minor (now Turkey). At that time Romans ruled Asia Minor and they persecuted all Christians. The Roman emperor Diocletian imprisoned Nicholas.Legend has it that Nicholas appeared in a dream to emperor Constantine the Great to plead for three people who were unjustly condemned to die. The next day the emperor enquired about the case and found that the people had been falsely accused. The emperor immediately set Nicholas free.Detail of an ancient byzantine fresco of the council of Nicaea. From the church of St Nicholas, Demre, Southern TurkeyNicholas was renowned for his pious and gentle nature and his extreme love for children and the poor. In 1087, his remains were taken to the Church of San Nicola at Bari, Italy, and buried there. The Pope made him saint and his Latin name became Sanctus Nicolaus.From the 11th to the 16th centuries, people throughout Europe, particularly in Norway, Greece and Russia, worshipped St. Nicholas. Many churches were also named after him. He became the patron saint of sailors and children as it was said that he helped ships brave the storms and saved many lives.Some ships even had his statue or at least carried his an image to ward off danger. In Norway, December 6 came to be associated as St. Nicholas’ Day. It was said that a bearded saint, whom they called Sinterklaas, would come riding a white horse to give presents to good children and carried a stick to beat naughty children.In the 17th century when the Dutch, along with the English, moved to America to settle there, they landed at New York, which at that time they called New Amsterdam. Since the sailors revered St. Nicholas, they decided to dedicate a day for him.In the next two centuries, the image of the Saint changed with passing generations. In 1823, Clement Clark Moore, son of a bishop, composed a poem “Twas the night before Christmas…” with the picture of the saint as a jolly old elf riding a sled pulled by flying reindeer. He even named the reindeer by the names we know today. The poem and the image became widely popular.In 1860, Thomas Nast, the caricaturist who created the donkey and elephant images to depict the two political parties in the US, drew a caricature of Santa for Harper’s Illustrated Weekly. Nast added some details to the Santa legend, including a workshop for toys at the North Pole. People soon believed that Santa lived in the North Pole.In 1925, it was discovered that there are no reindeer at the North Pole but they live in Lapland, Finland. In 1927, Markus Rautio who compered the popular ‘Children’s hour’ on Finnish radio revealed the secret of Santa’s address. He declared that Father X’mas lives on Lapland’s Korvatunturi (meaning ‘mount ear’) mountain in Savukoski county, Lapland, Finland.Santa Claus on his sleigh in the nordic countrysideIn 1931, Swedish artist Haddon H. Sundblom was asked by the American soft drink company Coca Cola to do a promotional campaign for them for Christmas.Coca-Cola was a client of Sundblom’s advertising agency from 1924 until his death in 1976. Sundblom painted Santa Claus as a human, a chubby white-bearded fellow dressed in a red coat (Coca Cola’s house colours) trimmed with white fur, red pants, high boots (for walking in the snow) and a leather belt around his middle.This life-like endearing illustration promoted by Coca Cola revolutionised forever the way America and the rest of the world viewed this merry ho-ho-ho-ing figure.From Saint Nicholas to Sinterklaas in Dutch to Santa Claus in America, to Father X’mas in Britain and Père Noël in France, this gift giver is known and looked forward to by children the world over.And to all those who really want to know whether Santa has an address and whether letters written by children reach him, the answer is Yes! There really is a Father X’mas (Santa Claus) address and post is delivered to him. The official post office is in the town of Napapiiri, near Rovaniemi, near the Korvatunturi mountain in Finland.

He mentions that Ala-ud-din Khilji of the Delhi Sultanate, who ruled Delhi over 700 years ago, organized a regular horse and foot runner service called harakuras in 1296 AD. These runners carried a baton with bells and ran across the allotted territory with mail. Runners changed after each mile and the post was delivered in record time.Mughal Emperor Babar developed the horse courier service and maintained a regular courier postal service.At this time in France, a certain Monsieur de Velayer had the idea of creating a small post office and in 1653, he offered his customers small pieces of paper mentioned ‘receipt for the payment of transport’. Letters with these pieces attached were to be put into letterboxes to be later sent to their destinations.The world’s first pre-paid postage stamps were issued on May 6, 1840 in Britain. Called the Penny Black stamp and the two Penny Blue stamp they carried the portrait of Queen Victoria, who was the British head of state then.Initial public reaction to this idea was not very favourable. But by January 1841, 72 million Penny Blacks were printed and issued.The method was rapidly adopted by other countries and the postage stamp came into being. India, a British colony then, was one of the first countries to adapt this system.Earlier in 1727, the East India Company (a company that had come to trade in India but ended up ruling it instead ) established the first post office in Inidia. In 1786 the first General Post Office was set up at Chennai.Following the Penny black, India issued a half-anna stamp in 1852 (an anna was the earlier Indian currency before the rupee system was adopted. 16 annas equalled a rupee). The world’s first circular stamp, the ‘Scinde Dawk’ (provincial), was issued on July 1, 1852. The stamp was embossed on circular red wafers with the logo of the East India Company. All India stamps for half anna and one anna were issued on October 1, 1854.India was soon leading the world with different variations of stamps. In 1866, for instance, Indian stamps were issued with the word OFFICIAL or SARKARI or SERVICE overstamped on them.Stamp printed by India, shows post office. rook76 \/ Shutterstock.comSo common are stamps that we take for granted the every tiny detail that goes into the making of this utilitarian product. But to millions of stamp collectors (the hobby is called philately) the issue of a new stamp is an eagerly anticipated event.Among various collector’s items from India are the stamps with multilingual inscriptions or inscriptions in several languages. Between 1871-1948 stamps from the then State of Hyderabad (now Andhra Pradesh) were inscribed in four languages – English, Marathi, Telugu and Urdu.Another collector’s item is the three country stamp. Stamps for Ethiopia portraying King Haile Selassie in his coronation robes, were lithographed (offset printed) at Nasik, in Maharashra state in India, and the value of these stamps were added by letter press printing at Khartoum in Sudan! Thus three countries left their ‘stamp’ on this stamp.Most stamps are printed at government security presses as these stamps have monetary value. However, there have been instances in India when stamps have been printed by other printers.Diamond Soap Works, Kishanganj printed a series of halftone stamps for the princely state of Kishanganj between 1913-16. Between 1911-28, the Jail Press at Jaipur in Rajasthan also printed stamps and for the princely state of Bundi, the ‘Times of India’ a daily newspaper, printed stamps at its press in 1947!And finally for some postal trivia. Mahatma Gandhi is the only person in the world to be honoured with a stamp by over 43 countries of the globe. Over 80 stamps honouring him have been printed including one from the Republic of South Africa.It was in South Africa that Gandhi had once been thrown out of a first class railway carriage for being Indian.

Yet, fish and other aquatic animals manage to survive.Animals like seals, penguins, walruses and a wide variety of sea birds are all fish eaters. They live in the Arctic and Antarctic Circle, amidst the icecaps. The land is completely frozen. Yet these animals manage to live in this region. How do they do it?The icy waters of the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans support a great amount of marine life. For millions of years life has remained unchanged, making it possible for these animals to adapt themselves to these particular patterns of existence.But they do get some help from nature. All liquids have a boiling point and a freezing point. When water boils at a certain temperature it turns into steam. When it is cooled to a certain temperature it freezes and becomes ice. Water boils at 100 degree Celsius (100 °C) and freezes at 0 °C. When the outside temperature falls below the freezing point of water, lakes and rivers get frozen.However, only the top layer of the lake or river freezes. Underneath the frozen upper layer, the water remains in its liquid form and does not freeze. Also, oxygen is trapped beneath the layer of ice. As a result, fish and other aquatic animals find it possible to live comfortably in the frozen lakes and ponds.Jellyfish: Fragile creature of the seaBut why doesn’t the entire body of water freeze, like a giant, lake-sized ice-cube? Generally, all liquids expand on heating, but water is an exception to this rule. If water is heated, its volume gradually decreases. (This decrease in volume continues till the temperature rises to 4 °C.) At temperatures over 4 °C water starts expanding. It then keeps expanding with the further rise in temperature, till finally at 100 °C it turns into steam.In other words, at 4 °C, water has the least volume (occupies the least amount of space) and maximum density (is at its heaviest). This irregular expansion of water is called anomalous expansion. This anomalous expansion plays an important role by only freezing the upper layer in lakes and rivers.During winter months in colder countries the outside or atmospheric temperature is very low – it drops to below freezing – and the upper layers of water in the lakes and ponds start cooling. When the temperature of the surface layers falls to 4 °C, the water body acquires maximum density and sinks down. The water that sinks down displaces water below, and the lower layers of water simultaneously rise up. This also gets cooled to 4 °C and again sinks down.When the temperature of the water body finally goes below 4 °C, the density or heaviness of water decreases and as a result water does not sink down. The surface water finally freezes at 0 °C while the lower part still remains at 4 °C. The light frozen layer of ice floats on top.Ice does not allow heat to pass through it easily, so the freezing of the waters below is a very slow process. At depths below 30 metres, temperatures are cold and stable, but food is scarce. As a result animals have adapted to this situation by growing more slowly.There are other dangers that fish face in freezing waters – like death. The body fluid of an ordinary fish can solidify if the temperature of the surrounding water drops below -5 °C. So Arctic and Antarctic fish have adjusted to their surroundings in an interesting manner.Certain species of cod, flatfish and polar fish have a reduced metabolic rate and produce antifreeze molecules called glycoprotein to reduce the freezing point of their body fluids. One could look at it as the fishy version of bears hibernating, a survival tactic that has seen these finned friends outlive many other creatures on Earth.","keyword":"[\"freeze\", \"temperature\", \"water\", \"lake\", \"layer\", \"fish\"]","ALS":"22.1875"},{"english_id":"530","id":"531","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"How Does the Steam Engine Work?","article":"In 1804 the first steam-powered engine ran, carrying some iron in Wales, in Britain. But it was almost twenty five years later, in 1829, that George Stephenson, a British engineer, designed the “rocket” that paved the way for railways all over Europe, Asia and America.The steam engine is an example of a heat engine. Heat engines are those that convert heat energy into mechanical work.Heat engines are of two types: external combustion engines and internal combustion engines. In an external combustion engine the fuel is burned outside the cylinder that produces power. In an internal combustion engine the fuel burns inside the cylinder.The steam engine is an example of an external combustion engine while a car has an internal combustion engine. The steam engine consists of:(i) a boiler(ii) safety valve(iii) cylinder(iv) steam reservoir(v) piston and(vi) a drive wheel.A steam engine needs steam to get it going. Coal from a coal tender is fed into the firebox where it is burnt at a temperature of 1400 degree C. This heat is used to turn water, also stored in the tender, into high pressure steam.This high-pressure steam energy is made to pass from the boiler to the steam reservoir through steam pipes. A slide valve in the piston opens and shuts two steam ports, alternately. This ensures that the steam passes through alternate ports.The piston is connected to a drive wheel. When the steam enters into the slide valve, it pushes the piston to the right and turns the wheel. The left valve closes and the right valve is opened letting in steam on the other side of the piston.At this instant, steam entering this valve pushes the piston to its left and drives the wheel to a complete circle. This process goes on repeating and drives the train forward.A traction engine is a self-propelled steam engine used to move heavy loads on roads, plough ground or to provide power at a chosen location.The heavy drive wheel is fixed to the crankshaft of the engine. A speed governor regulates the speed of the engine. In certain engines some of the steam that has passed through the piston and is still hot is used to re-heat some of the cold water before it enters the boiler. The rest of the spent steam billows out of the chimney.Today, most of the functions of steam engines have been taken over by internal combustion engines fueled by diesel which in turn are being replaced by the more ecologically sound electric engines.","keyword":"[\"engine\", \"steam\", \"combustion\", \"piston\", \"valve\", \"drive\"]","ALS":"31.066666666666666"},{"english_id":"532","id":"533","level":"5","topic":"18","title":"How Green is Your School?","article":"Here’s a little check – list from the New Delhi based children’s newspaper Gobar Times, to rate your school.Getting ThereOptimum use of the school bus fleet: School bus routes should cover a lot of area, with the fleet picking up as many students as possible.Car pooling: This is quite a workable idea today. Students coming to school from the same neighbourhood should be encouraged to car-pool, after working out the cost of petrol and vehicle wear and tear.The ClassroomSaving energy: Sometimes, we’re so busy making the world a better place that we forget to switch off the fans lights when we leave the classroom.And paper: At the end of a year, there are usually lots of blank pages left in exercise books. These make great rough books and note-pads when torn out and stitched\/stapled. Re-using the flip-side of photocopied notes also saves paper. Also photocopy on both sides of the paper.The watering holeThe green canteen: Plastic and thermocol throw-away cups may be cheap and convenient, but they are extremely eco-unfriendly. Investing in some good reusable crockery is cheaper in the long run.School taps: Make sure that drinking water taps and bathroom taps aren’t left running and don’t leak. This will save precious water.Catch water: A school could work out a system of catching rainwater and storing it. Take a space of 25 sq metres, perhaps the roof, in a city that gets 50cm of rain in a year. The amount of run-off would be close to 12,500 litres per year. That’s two months of water supply for a family of four – for everything that a family of four does !The Green PatchOver-watering: Many schools have a field, a lawn or a green patch that is its pride. The mali often leaves the hose spouting water, making soggy patches all over the grass. This does not make the grass any greener. If possible, use sprinklers or a drip-system of watering. These are much more efficient.Home’s best: Plant indigenous or local species of plants and trees which are acclimatised and aren’t water-guzzlers or need artificially-heated hot-houses.Clubbed TogetherAn eco-club that invites interesting speakers to speak at the assembly, organises trips to successful projects or gets involved in green networks is a must.Wall Mag : An eco-mag that’s informative and entertaining, but easy to produce, serves as a platform for sharing new ideas and good experiences. Good work and upcoming events should be displayed on a notice – board. The third alternative is combining these to make a Wall-Magazine.Wasting AwayRecycling garbage: If you have the space, make a compost-pit to turn organic waste produced in the kitchen, etc, into soil-enriching manure that can be used on school lawns. This reduces the use artificial fertilizers.School VastuThe design of a school building should be such that it optimises on natural lighting and air flow. This can reduce the use of lights and fans to a very great extent. So, orienting a building and its doors and windows so that catch the dominant wind and light directions is very important in energy – saving, besides influencing the atmosphere.

Now how about some cool custard with jelly on the side for dessert? Doesn’t the jelly look inviting, a transparent red-coloured blob sitting pretty on the plate, making you long to dig your spoon into it?Called Jell-O in the United States of America, jelly changes shape with the change in temperature. It stays sets at room temperature, which is between 0 degrees and 20 degree C. Warm it to about 27 degree C and watch it disintegrate into a watery mixture. Cool it and it thickens until it sets again.Do you know what substance makes jelly set? It is gelatin, a special gel-making agent. Gelatin is made from collagen, which is a fibrous protein found in certain tissues in animals’ bodies. So, your plate of jelly is actually a non-vegetarian dessert!Gelatin is made when animal skin or bone is boiled in water. Strands of collagen separate out of the tissue and react with water to become gelatin. Even one per cent of collagen, when dissolved in water, will make the gel. Gelatin contains millions of long chains of protein that separate into tiny filaments when mixed with warm water.How is jelly formed?Each filament attracts water molecules to itself. This reduces the number of water molecules free to flow through the mixture. As the mixture cools, the water-rich filaments begin to bump into one another and intertwine. The remaining water gets confined within a thicket of protein filaments and the mixture thickens into a gel.Gelatin is used in other foodstuffs like marshmallows and ice creams as well. It is also used to bind chemicals used in photographic film, in pharmaceuticals and glue.Did people use gelatin before it was sold in shops? Yes. People made gelatin at home. And that meant boiling bones, or using isinglass, a kind of gelatin obtained from fish.But today, apart from gelatin, starch and pectin are also used to gel or thicken foodstuffs. Starch is used to thicken sauces and to make confectionaries like Turkish Delight. Pectin, which is obtained from fruit, binds fruit preserves.Starch and pectin are types of sugars formed into long molecular chains. Also called complex carbohydrates or polysaccharides, they are excellent sources of food energy. But gelatin is not. Since it lacks an essential amino acid, gelatin does not have high protein content.","keyword":"[\"gelatin\", \"jelly\", \"thicken\", \"filament\", \"collagen\", \"pectin\"]","ALS":"18.91304347826087"},{"english_id":"534","id":"535","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"How Lizards Defy Gravity","article":"Lizards slithering up walls or dangling precariously from overhead lights are a common sight in tropical countries. These slimy creatures zipping up walls are called geckos. They are the only lizard species that make any sound, other than hissing — in fact they make a loud clicking noise that sounds like “gecko”, hence the name.Recent studies show that the gecko’s ability to cling on to surfaces could well lead to the creation of the world’s first non-sticky, self-cleaning adhesive! According to scientists at the University of California, gecko feet function a bit like the tape we use for sticking. Of course a gecko’s tenacious hold is far, far stronger than any earthly tape.How Lizards Defy GravityScientist have often analysed the feet of geckos in order to understand the lizard’s sticking prowess. For years scientists assumed that the pads on the lizard’s feet created suction. This idea was discarded when experiments proved that lizards continued to cling on to surfaces — even in a vacuum.Researchers have only recently discovered what really enables geckos to scuttle across ceilings and walls without losing their grip. By carefully examining the tiny hair that cover a gecko’s toes, the team discovered that the microscopic hair split up into even tinier pads called spatulae. These spatulae are incredibly minute (each is about a lakh times smaller than an inch). The combined adhesive property of these pads is quite impressive — in fact the adhesive power is so effective that a gecko can dangle from the ceiling by one toe!By filming geckos, running up walls, the scientists discovered that geckos carefully uncurl their toes as they take each step. And when they take their feet off the wall they simply reverse this process – an act similar to the peeling off of tape from a surface. The tiny hair on the toes rolls out to stick to the surface, as the gecko walks, and then peels off as the gecko lifts its toes. Curiously enough gecko feet do not contain any gummy substances, so the lizards do not use glue or liquid to grab on. Nor do they need a special surface to cling on to – like Velcro requires.The fact that gecko hairs function very, very differently from a regular adhesive (or Velcro) is of great interest to scientists. Researchers are now keen to use gecko hairs to make the world’s first dry adhesives! Scientists also noticed that gecko hairs are self cleaning – apparently, the teeny hair, on the gecko’s toes, always remain ultra-clean and springy. Scientists have yet to figure out why, and when they do – we can get rid of messy glue and opt for a dry, self-cleaning alternative.","keyword":"[\"gecko\", \"lizard\", \"adhesive\", \"hair\", \"wall\", \"cling\"]","ALS":"29.705882352941178"},{"english_id":"535","id":"536","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"How Many Kinds of Rhinos are There?","article":"A modern day rhino or rhinoceros looks pretty much like its ancestor that existed on earth more than 30 million years ago.Its status as an animal “biggie” hasn’t changed much either. The ancestors of the modern-day rhinoceros – the 4 feet tall Uintatherium and the 15 feet high Indricotherium – were the largest land mammals ever. Today’s rhino is the largest living land mammal, after the African elephant, in terms of size and weight.The name ‘rhinoceros’ is derived from two Greek words ‘rhino’ meaning ‘nose’ and ‘keros’ meaning ‘horned’.A pair of African Rhinoceros at the lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya, Africa.There are five different kinds of rhinoceroses in the world. Two of these are found in Africa and three in Asia. The two African varieties are the black and white. The Asian varieties are found in India, Java and Sumatra.The largest rhino is the African white, measuring six feet high at the shoulder and weighing over four tonnes. The smallest is the Sumatran rhino, standing at about four-and-a-half feet at the shoulder and weighing less than a tonne.This powerful animal has one or two curved horns, which grow on top of its nose. The African and the Sumatran varieties have two horns, while the Indian and Javan rhinos have only one horn. White rhinos have larger horns, which can grow up to five feet in length!Rhino horns are entirely replaceable. They are made up of hair-like growth that thickens and grows above the nasal and the frontal bones. The horns are not attached to the skull and may even be torn off during a fight. When this happens, the horn grows back again.A pair of Asian Rhinoceros Bardia National Park, Nepal.Rhinoceroses are herbivores or plant eaters. They are shy and solitary and love to wallow in a muddy pool to beat the heat of the day. As they stomp out of the pool, they have a thick layer of mud, which on drying keeps the rhino cool and also protects the animal against insect bites.While all rhinos have thick hides, the Indian variety, which is found in the northeastern state of Assam, is distinguished with pleated skin that looks like armour plating. At first appearance, when their hides are clean, both the white and black African rhinos look very similar and confusingly have the same colour – grey.However their feeding habits differ. The white rhino is a grazer and eats ground plants and grass. So it has a wide, flat mouth. The term ‘white’ has nothing to do with its colour. It is a corruption of the Afrikaans word (language of South Africa) “wit” meaning “wide” rhino.The black rhino is a browser. It feeds on leaves plucked from shrubs and bushes. So it has a hook-like upper lip.Rhinos belongs to the ‘odd-toed’ group of ungulates (hoofed animals). They have three toes on each foot, each toe ending in a separate hoof. Each front foot actually also has a fourth toe that is no longer used.Rhinos are nearsighted animals, but have good hearing and an excellent sense of smell. When they hear a strange noise or smell something new, they lumber across on their short legs. Their power and sheer weight gives them confidence and, since they can’t see well, they charge without warning.A female rhino bears one calf at a time. The calf is born about 18 months after the mating season and remains with the mother for several years. Though these animals are shy, they are known for unprovoked attacks, especially when there is a young calf around.But the rhino population is dwindling. Over the centuries, man has hunted the animal for its horn, believing that this cone of matted hair contained magical properties.The African black, the Indian one-horned and the Javan species are heavily poached. In fact, the Javan is facing extinction with less than 50 individual rhinos left.The white rhino population has recovered a little over the last 20 years due the rigorous policing of the Kruger National Park in South Africa. To deter further poaching, game wardens sometimes cut off the horns so that these animals are not unnecessarily killed.","keyword":"[\"rhino\", \"horn\", \"rhinoceros\", \"african\", \"javan\", \"white\"]","ALS":"25.966666666666665"},{"english_id":"537","id":"538","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"How Wool Came Into Existence","article":"It must have been a very intelligent human who looked at a sheep walking past and thought of the use its fleece might have!Although the oldest surviving textile made out of wool is around 3,500 years old, the oldest fine woolen fabric dates to the fifth century BC (about 2,500 years ago) and was found in an ancient Greek colony.How Wool Came Into ExistenceWool was probably the first fiber to be woven into a textile. Because when primitive man stopped hunting and started herding animals, it was his first step from a primitive life to a civilised one. Sheep were sort of a stone age convenience store for the nomadic lifestyle of our primitive ancestors, a walking food supply that required little care. Sheep provided for all the basic needs – meat and milk for food, skin and bones for clothing, shelter and tools.The loose wool was less essential, but as the animals shed their coats each spring, tufts of fleece were gathered and used to soften some of life’s harder edges. Slowly, it dawned upon someone that the fleece was the best part of the sheep.Eventually, sheep destined for mutton roasts and sheep destined for fine woven rugs were distinguished, as good eating does not necessarily mean good quality wool. Early wild species of sheep had long, coarse outer hair protecting their short fleece undercoats. It is this under-layer that is desirable for textile use and has been selectively bred into modern sheep.Early civilizations tended flocks of sheep and great empires were built on the backs of sheep and their wool. Around 1800 BC the civilization of Babylonia was famous for its wool. In 45 AD, the Romans conquered Spain, where they bred their own sheep with breeds from Africa and Europe, and in the process, developed a new breed that would come to be known as the Spanish Merino, with the whitest, finest wool ever known. Today, the Merino is the most highly regarded breed in the world.Spain and Great Britain rose to power on the strength of their wool industries. The Merino sheep became so important that, during the Middle Ages, Spain dominated the wool market and accumulated great wealth. Death was the penalty for anyone caught taking a Merino sheep out of the country.Hogging all the wealth from the secrets of a fabric seem to have been the done thing in ancient times. The Chinese held onto the secret of silk for thousands of years, before Europe even got a clue about how to put two strands together. With wool, they seem to have got their revenge.","keyword":"[\"wool\", \"sheep\", \"fleece\", \"merino\", \"breed\", \"textile\"]","ALS":"33.785714285714285"},{"english_id":"538","id":"539","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"How are Earthquakes Recorded?","article":"When an earthquake takes place, people say that it measured 6.2 or 6.5 on the scale. The scale they are referring to is the Richter Scale developed by Charles Richter in the 1930s.The Richter Scale measures the magnitude of the seismic waves or vibrations that travels across the earth’s surface. The scale uses a logarithmic formula using high-frequency data collected from seismograph stations.However, long before Richter developed his scale, a Chinese philosopher Chang Heng invented a device to measure earthquakes in 132 A.D. He constructed a large urn that had eight open-mouthed dragon-heads holding a ball each in their mouths, on the outside.Each head faced one of eight principal directions of the compass. Below each dragon-head was a toad with its mouth open.When an earthquake did occur, one or more of the eight dragon-mouths would release the ball into the open mouth of the toad below. Depending on which dragon released the ball, the direction of the earthquake was identified.After an earth-shattering rumble, one of the first question people ask is “where was it?” Unfortunately, the earth is not transparent and we can’t just see or photograph the earthquake disturbance.When an earthquake occurs, it generates an expanding wave front from the hypocentre (The calculated location of the focus of an earthquake) at a speed of several kilometres per second.Scientists have for centuries tried to device a method to study the force of these seismic waves. Before the advent of electronic instruments, scientists built large spring-pendulums to record the vibrations produced by quakes.It was only in the late 19th century that a 10-point scale was conceived by François-Alphones Forel and Michele Stefano de Rossi. In 1902, Italian volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli created a 12-point scale of intensity.Mercalli’s scale measured the intensity of shaking during an earthquake. This is calculated by inspecting the damage caused by the quake and interviewing the survivors later.However, this was not very accurate as the intensity of shaking varies from place to place and different ratings were given for the same earthquake.Unlike the Mercalli scale, the Richter scale measured the magnitude of an earthquake at its epicentre (a point on the earth’s surface directly above the hypocentre of an earthquake).Seismograph instrument recording ground motion during earthquakeThis was more accurate as there can be only one measure taken no matter where you record it. Magnitude is calculated according to the amount of energy released during the earthquake.Earthquakes are recorded by a whole network of seismographic stations located at strategic places across the world. A seismograph is a simple instrument that consists of a suspended weight with a pen attached to it. Next to the pen is a large paper roll.Under normal conditions the pen draws a straight line. As the ground vibrates due to the tension released from below the surface of the earth, energy is released and travels outward in waves.When the frame vibrates, the pen draws a zigzag pattern. This line is called a seismogram and records the amplitude of the seismic waves at the site.The ground motion at each seismograph is recorded electronically at the recording site. As the wave expands from the earthquake, it reaches more distant seismic stations. Each station measures and times the distance and time the wave front passes the station and this is then tabulated until the epicentre is located.With new technology, it became apparent that the Richter Scale was valid only for certain energy frequency and distance ranges. So scientists have developed new magnitude scales that are an extension of Richter’s original idea.These include body-wave magnitude, surface-wave magnitude, and moment magnitude. For very large earthquakes, moment magnitude gives the most reliable estimate of earthquake size.Sometimes the magnitude is reported by different networks based on only their recordings. This difference is a result of the different instruments used and their locations with respect to the earthquake epicentre.","keyword":"[\"earthquake\", \"scale\", \"magnitude\", \"richter\", \"measure\", \"seismic\"]","ALS":"36.473684210526315"},{"english_id":"542","id":"543","level":"5","topic":"12","title":"How did Christianity Come to India?","article":"Would you doubt my word if I say that Doubting Thomas, one of the Apostles of Christ visited India and established Christianity? Don’t. For its true.Among Christ’s 12 apostles, Thomas Didaemus or Doubting Thomas, along with Peter and Paul were pre-eminent. Thomas Didaemus was called Doubting Thomas because he doubted Christ’s word that on the third day after his crucifixion, Christ would rise again.There are many schools of thought as to how Christianity spread in India. Some claim it is through St. Thomas who came to India in 52 A.D. Others claim that a Syrian merchant, Thomas of Cana, came to Travancore in Kerala and established a Christian colony there.Church in the backwaters of Kerala, IndiaThomas Didaemus is believed to have visited India in two phases. His first mission took him to the Parthian empire in the Indo-Scythian border province of Kandahar (now in Afghanistan). Christians believed that king Gundapar who ruled in India, allowed Thomas to preach the gospel in his kingdom.For 10 centuries, the existence of such a king was doubted. However, a large number of coins discovered in Kabul, Kandahar, and in the Punjab, bear the name of Gondophores. Research indicates that Gondophores probably ruled Peshawar between 20 and 45 A.D. However, there is no further evidence whether the first Christians were converted here or not.In his second visit to India, Thomas landed at Musiris (Cranganore) in Kerala in 52 A.D. He made his first converts of Jews and Hindus in Cranganore, Palayur and Quilon among other places.At Palayur, he organized the new coverts and appointed priests from among the leading families. Alongside he organised the erection of the first church in India at Palayur, now in Trichur district. He is also credited with establishing six other churches in India.St. Thomas then moved on to the east coast of India making conversions and crossed over to China. Returning to India he shifted base to Madras (now Chennai). But the people here did not appreciate the new religion and he was persecuted and killed in a cave in what is now called the St Thomas’ Mount in 72 A.D.Armenian Christians discovered his grave in the sixth century and a church built on the site, a village now called Mylapore, in Chennai. Traders called this village ‘Betumah’ or ‘Town of Thomas’. Marco Polo in his travels was supposed to have visited this church.In 1523, Portuguese settlers built a Church over his grave and called it San Thome after the apostle. This is now the nucleus of the present San Thome Basilica.In 1606, the Diocese of San Thome was established at the personal request of King Philip II of Portugal to Pope Paul V. In 1898, Dom Henriques Reed de Silva, the first Bishop of Mylapore, built a new neo-Gothic cathedral over the old site. is a small bone of his hand, together with a portion of bloodstained earth and head of the lance, which struck him down.However, the remains of St. Thomas were later shifted to Edessa in Iraq and later to the Greek island of Chios.

Their hands and fingers move animatedly as they silently ‘speak’ sentences that sometimes you can also guess at. These people are actually conversing using sign language because they are hearing or speech impaired.Across the world, people have developed sign language to communicate with each other and with the rest of the world. Signs and gestures have always been in use. Medieval monks who have taken vows of silence, Native Americans, African bushmen and others are fluent in the art of gestures and sign language communication. These could be signs such as asking for food or water. In England, the medieval monk Venerable Bede devised a number code based on manual signs.English alphabet in sign languageIndian classical dancers also make use of a rich vocabulary of gestures called ‘mudras’. Most ‘mudras’ describe actions, such as eating, while others represent emotions, animals, even gods and goddesses. For example, by joining the thumb, the middle finger and ring finger, while the other two are fully extended, the dancer represent a deer.Sign language, as we know it today, originated in the 16th century when an Italian physician called Geronimo Cardano, decided to teach deaf people by writing a combination of symbols and associating them with the thing they represented.However, the real breakthrough came in 1755, when a French priest, Abbe Charles Michel de L’Epée, founded a school for deaf people in Paris. He developed a form of communication through a system of gestures, hand signs, and finger spelling for easy communication. The Abbe improvised his system after studying existing signs and gestures used by deaf people. This ultimately became a finger-spelt version of spoken French of the time.The L’Epée system became the forerunner of modern day French sign language. In 1816, Dr Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet adopted this system after seeing it in Paris. In 1817, the first permanent school for the deaf was established at Hartford, Connecticut in the US. This sign language was merged with various gestures already in use to form what came to be known as American Sign Language.Around the same time, in 1778 in Germany, Samuel Heinicke was working on a system to teach deaf people the science of lip reading. Heinicke developed a system of teaching through oral patterns wherein deaf people could understand words by studying the lip movements of speakers.The most important element of manual communication is the use of hands and fingers to simulate concepts and ideas or express words through finger spelling.Some gestures are universal. For example putting a finger to your head and twirling it is universally understood to mean “slightly mad”. Or the forefinger rubbed across the lips to mean “you’re lying”! Modern day sign language uses both single hand, as in the American system, or double hand spelling, as in British and other European systems.Since each country has its own sign language with gestures, an international sign language called Gestuno has been developed. In international conferences and events, Gestuno has found a ready audience.Listen spelled in sign languageSign language works beautifully between two people knowing the language. But when a hearing\/speaking person who doesn’t know sign wants to ‘talk’ to a hearing-impaired person, he needs to keep some things in mind.He or she must first draw the attention of the person s\/he wants to speak to so the person can see the speaker. Speak clearly without mumbling and never turn your head away while speaking. If the person cannot see your lips, you may as well be talking to a wall.Be precise and if what you say is not understood, repeat what you said without shouting. Shouting distorts the mouth and lips and it becomes difficult to lip read.Never belittle or waive a sentence off, if you think the other person hasn’t understood. The responsibility for communicating clearly lies with you.","keyword":"[\"gesture\", \"language\", \"deaf\", \"finger\", \"understood\", \"person\"]","ALS":"29.24"},{"english_id":"544","id":"545","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"How did the Modern Horse Originate?","article":"Many millions of years ago a fox-like animal roamed across the plains of what is now the American continent. At that time the continents were not even divided as they are today.This animal had four soft toes on its feet like a cat or dog. This animal came to be called the ‘eohippus’ by modern day scientists who discovered skeletal fossils of this specie.Horses running in snowThe skeletal remains of this animal had many things in common with the skeletal structure of the modern horse, especially in the structure and distribution of its teeth. That is why scientists concluded that the eohippus is the ancestor of the modern horse even though the two don’t even look alike.Why did the eohippus change? In nature, animals develop according to the environment. If they had plenty to eat they increased in size. If they had to depend on speed, their leg muscles became strong. They changed colour to provide them with a natural disguise.The eohippus was a grass eater. It did not have fangs to protect itself or a hard shell like a turtle in which to hide. To escape the larger meat eaters the eohippus needed to run fast. Since it could run faster on tiptoe its outside toes were not used and became useless.Gradually the outer toes disappeared and the middle toes developed. This process of change is called mutation. After millions of years, the eohippus changed through various changes (otohippus, mesohippus, merychippus) so much that it was called ‘pliohippus’ – the first of the prehistoric horse. The pliohippus was still small but it had developed its centre toe with a thick horny nail.A million years ago, the first horse developed that resembled the modern horse. This was named ‘equus’. The equus lived in America at first, moving slowly southward. From here it shifted to Asia, Africa and Europe.From this equus four main types of horses developed, each with mane and tail and a hard hoof. In Asia, it divided itself into two types – the tarpan and Przhevalski’s horse. Both are strong sturdy animals that still look exactly as they did a million years ago.The tarpan is a stocky mouse-coloured horse with short legs, a large head with a shaggy coat against the cold. The Przhevalski’s horse (named after the Russian discoverer) or the ‘horse of the steppes’ is also short (four feet tall) and stocky.Przhevalsky horses — named after the Russian geographer and explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky.The tarpan is still very untameable and wild and both types inhabit the steppes of Russia and China, Mongolia, and the Altai mountains of central Asia.In Europe, the climate is milder than the cold barren plains of Mongolia and here developed the Equus robustus or ‘Great Horse’. This was a big strong horse that looked like the draught horses of today, the same breed that knights used to ride on with their heavy armour.In Africa and in Central Asia developed a faster moving horse and because of its agility it was called Equus agilis. From this type came the Arabian and Greek strains of horses. This was a lighter, taller, and swifter horse than the rest.Like the oxen, goat, dog, cat and other animals which man tamed and domesticated, early man found the horse very useful and he thus domesticated it.Through selective breeding, man developed different breeds of horses for different purposes, like racing, breeding, pulling carts, and so on.The very word ‘equus’ comes from the Greek word ‘acer’ meaning ‘quick’ or ‘swift’. Coincidentally, both the Mesopotamians (modern day Iraq) and ancient Indias (about three thousand five hundred years ago) called this animal – ‘asva’, meaning swift – from the Sanskrit word for horse!","keyword":"[\"horse\", \"eohippus\", \"equus\", \"develop\", \"skeletal\", \"tarpan\"]","ALS":"29.125"},{"english_id":"546","id":"547","level":"5","topic":"14","title":"How did the Safety Match Originate?","article":"Fire was invented when two flint stones were struck together igniting a spark. From earliest times people made fire by either striking flint stones or by rubbing a hard stick against a soft one so that the friction caused soft flakes to peel off and start to smoulder.The only improvement on these primitive methods was the tinder box that contained some steel, flint, and some dry tinder for the spark to ignite. This tinder was often pieces of linen or silk. But this was a time-consuming process especially if the tinder was damp or cold.In the 18th century matches were invented which immediately made the process of transferring the flame from the tinder to where it was needed easier and simpler. Early matches were strips of wood or cardboard or waxed paper with one end tipped with a chemical.Initially these splinters of wood were dipped in sulphur. Sulphur was discovered much earlier and it is reported that the Chinese used such sulphur matches as early as the sixth century. However, while sulphur flared easily, it produced dangerous fumes. Though these matches became popular as they were cheap, the tinder box was still needed to produce the first spark.A breakthrough was made in 1827 by John Walker an English chemist. He invented a match that had a combination of antimony sulphide, potassium chlorate, gum arabic and starch on its head. The match burst into flames with a series of small explosions that showered the experimenter with sparks. Walker called them “friction lights” as the flame was created by friction.Old matches: Small wooden sticks with much sulfur on itBut these friction lights would sometimes ignite accidentally making them dangerous. Thankfully in 1844, a Swedish chemist Gustav E. Pasch came up with the idea of putting only some of these chemicals on the match head and the rest on the side of the box in which the matches could be kept and carried. The match then, could only be ignited when struck against the side of the box. This idea of “safety matches” was taken up and they began to be mass produced.But what do present day matches contain? Red phosphorus is the main substance used in the match industry. Matches are of two types: Lucifer or friction matches and Safety matches.Lucifer or friction matches light when rubbed against any rough surface. The match is basically a wood splint slightly longer than a normal matchstick. The tips are of two colours – red and white or blue and white.The tip of the wooden strip is first dipped in molten sulphur or paraffin wax. The small white tip is made from the paste of phosphorus trisulphide. The red tip is made of various chemicals and substances – antimony trisulphide (to act as kindling material), potassium chlorate (to support combustion), glass or silica powder (to cause friction) and gum (to act as binder).Lucifer matches can be struck against any hard surface that provides friction. When the stick is rubbed, the white tipped portion first ignites the match and when the tip has caught fire the red or blue part of the tip burns and carries the flame up the rest of the matchstick.In the case of safety matches they can only be ignited by striking them against a special surface usually located on the match box. In addition red phosphorous is used to ignite the matchstick instead of phosphorous trisulphide.Because of the fact that they easily burst into flames, Lucifer matches are no longer in general use. However, they are very popular in Westerns where cowboys are seen lighting the match on their boots, on the seat of the pants and even lighting it from their nails!","keyword":"[\"match\", \"ignite\", \"tinder\", \"friction\", \"flame\", \"sulphur\"]","ALS":"28.91304347826087"},{"english_id":"547","id":"548","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"How did the Teddy Bear Get Its Name?","article":"It was party time for the 40 giant teddy bears.

After all he’s got the nickname of one of America’s most famous presidents, Theodore ‘Teddy’ Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 and under his presidency America’s stature grew in world affairs. And therein lies a tale.The year was 1902. Forty-four-year-old Roosevelt, who had stepped in to become President following the assassination of William McKinley, in 1901, was in a mood to go hunting.Having had a frail and asthmatic childhood, he had gone out of his way to lead a rough outdoors life. In 1898, during the Spanish-American war, he even led one of the toughest units, called the US Rough Riders, into Cuba.So there he was, in Mississippi on November 15, and in a mood to hunt. The presidential hunting party went after and lassoed a frail black bear and tied it to a tree to make it easy for Roosevelt to shoot the animal.The incident was made famous by cartoonist Clifford Barryman of the ‘Washington Post’ on the front page the next day. His cartoon pictured Roosevelt wearing a “cowboy” hat, standing with his back to the animal signaling his refusal to have it shot.The cartoon took America by storm, particularly a shopkeeper in New York. Morris Michtom ran a stationary and novelty store and was quick to spot a winning business opportunity. He immediately displayed two toy bears made by his wife, Rose, in his shop window.A teddy bearHe asked for and was granted permission by the president to call his bears “Teddy’s Bears”.

Made by Margaret Steiff of the Steiff company, it was displayed commercially for the first time during a business fair at Leipzig, Germany, in 1903.The stuffed bear attracted the curiosity of an American who ordered a couple of thousands to take back with him.What must he have felt on landing in America with his bears and then seeing similar teddy bears sold all over!

Nearly every home has at least one. It is a very necessary utility needed in all homes to maintain hygiene. It is really amazing how this system works – you press a lever or pull a chain and whoosh! About two gallons of water rushes down into the porcelain bowl in three and four seconds. Gurgle-gurgle-urp it is clean and ready for use again!Toilets were known in India as early as three thousand years ago! Excavations at Harappa revealed drainage facilities with effective sanitation. However, the Chinese were the first to use flush toilets. Archaeologists found a two thousand year old antique latrine belonging to the Han Dynasty complete with running water, a stone seat and a comfortable armrest. It was a fact that French king Louis XIII had his toilet fashioned after his throne.A collection of flush toilets or water closet as they are called in some parts of the world.The toilet is a simple mechanism. Let’s plunge into the depths of the toilet tank to know how it works. Does your toilet have a tank that is visible? Remove the cover and take a look inside. You can see a float ball attached to a handle and a U-shaped tube protruding from the water.Whatever the design, every toilet commode consists of a bowl, the flushing mechanism and, a refill mechanism.The basic toilet mechanism is the bowl. Even without a tank to flush water, the bowl does all the functions a toilet needs to perform. Most Indian homes have only the bowl which is called an Orissa Pan.The bowl is attached to a pipe with a U-bend to the sewer. When you pour a bucketful of water in the bowl, the water comes in fast. The excess water goes through the bend and is sucked out and sent to the sewer pipe. As water empties out the bowl, air rushes in and this makes the distinct recognizable gurgling or “flush” sound. The air then stops the siphoning process.However the siphon doesn’t work if you pour a glassful of water. The water level does not rise as the excess water spills into the bend immediately.The tank attached just above the bowl acts like a reservoir. It stores enough water to send it fast enough into the bowl to activate the siphon. The tank takes a minute or so to fill up. When you press the lever or pull the chain all the water in the tank is dumped into the bowl in less than three seconds that is equal to pouring in a bucket of water.The chain or lever is connected to the flush valve. It lifts the flush valve allowing water to slip through a drain hole. The drain hole is connected to the bowl and water flows in. As the tank of water enters the bowl rapidly it fills and activates the siphon and all the water and waste in the bowl is sucked out.As the tank empties, the flush valve goes back to cover the drain hole. Now water comes into the tank to refill it.Here is where the float ball comes in. The float ball is connected to a valve that automatically turns the water on and off. When the water in the tank reaches a certain level it holds up the ball so it floats level, shutting off the refilling mechanism. When the tank is empty the float ball falls free allowing the valve to open and fill the tank.In the house, the toilet is the largest consumer of water as it washes down nearly 2.2 gallons at every flush. Considering the lack of adequate drinking water in most parts of the world it is perhaps best if we all shift over to gassifiers, a new water-free system of waste disposal scientists are working on.","keyword":"[\"toilet\", \"bowl\", \"flush\", \"tank\", \"valve\", \"water\"]","ALS":"21.46875"},{"english_id":"562","id":"563","level":"5","topic":"16","title":"How does a Nuclear Bomb differ from a Conventional Bomb?","article":"Every now and then we hear of countries of the world carrying out heated discussions about nuclear bombs.

Atomic bombs on the other hand, release 50 per cent energy as blast, 35 per cent as heat and 15 per cent as nuclear radiation. You could get an idea as to how disastrous a nuclear bomb could be, by this simple comparison: one kilogram of nuclear fission fuel can release energy 20,000,000 times more than one kilogram of TNT (tri-nitro-toluene), the explosive material used in conventional bombs.How does a Nuclear Bomb differ from a Conventional Bomb? [The Indian Case For Disarmament]How devastating?When a nuclear bomb explodes, most people within a radius of three to thirty miles would either get killed or seriously injured. The possible burn out in towns and cities could be as large as 100 square kilometres for a 1 megaton explosion.Heat and BlastSmall or large, all nuclear blasts create fireballs with temperatures exceeding 300,000 degrees celsius. These fireballs act as shock waves that blow down everything in their path for many kilometres around. The explosion also results in hurricane winds and firestorms over large areas.RadiationIn addition to great heat and blast, nuclear bombs also result in radiation in the form of gamma rays, neutrons and alpha and beta particles. Radioactive reactions of a nuclear blast generally occur in two ways.The first is an immediate radioactivity pulse, which can kill people on the spot if the dose is high enough.The second form is persistent radioactivity or one that continues to be present even after the blast. This is produced partly from unused fuel, partly from radioactive decay products of the fuel generated during the explosion, and partly from materials that absorb radiation.All of these together constitute radioactive ‘dust’ or fallout. After the blast is over, this radioactive dust hangs in the atmosphere. As it is spread all around by wind and rain, it contaminates water and air. These contaminated elements are consumed by plants and thus enter into the bodies of other organisms in the food chain. So even when the blast itself is finished, living beings continue to suffer from its after-effects.Many of these components emit radiation for really large periods of time, ranging for a thousand years or more.Effects of radioactivity on living organismsRadioactivity is a powerful energy and can damage the organs it passes through. These include the DNA, cells, blood cells, and the skin.Exposure to nuclear weapon radiation leads to ill-health and malfunctioning of the body. It damages the cells involved in reproduction, can cause still-births, and genetic damages.Thus, unlike any conventional weapons of warfare, the damage caused by nuclear weapons is not limited either in space, or, even more critically, in time.Nuclear weapons leave effects that pass from one generation to another. And they do not respect any borders for the water, soil and air they pollute know no boundaries. That is something that most countries lose sight of.Source: Compiled from ‘Out of Nuclear Darkness’; The Indian Case For Disarmament; published by Movement In India For Disarmament","keyword":"[\"nuclear\", \"bomb\", \"conventional\", \"blast\", \"radioactive\", \"weapon\"]","ALS":"31"},{"english_id":"564","id":"565","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"How does the Lotus Flower Clean itself?","article":"How will you explain the meaning of purity to someone? Well, many people do it by giving the example of the lotus — it grows in muddy waters but the flower remains spotless. It is not surprising that the lotus has a special or sacred place in world religions like Hinduism and Buddhism. It is a symbol of purity, and many a time gods are shown seated on lotus thrones. Now a group of German Scientists has discovered that the lotus plant is truly spotless. It does not allow any dirt to remain on its surface. And there is a clear reason for it.Lotus leaves are round and large and it is almost impossible to get them wet. You may splash as much water as you want on a lotus leaf, but the droplets immediately roll off. What makes this water plant’s leaves water repellent?Scientists have always known that aquatic leaves secrete or give out wax crystals. These crystals help prevent the leaves from getting flooded with the water around the leaves. They also help the leaves retain the required amount of moisture. The leaves are able to do this because wax repels water.Now the scientists have discovered that these leaf surfaces have an amazing ability to clean themselves. Scientists at the University of Bonn carried out extensive research to show that the water droplets rolling off a lotus leaf carry away dirt particles leaving the surface perfectly clean. This phenomena has been named the ‘Lotus Effect’ and works best on rough surfaces. A report on the scientists’ study was published in the journal ‘Planta’.The leaves of a lotus flower repeal water (superhydrophobicity) leading to self-cleaning properties, sometimes called the lotus effect.Contrary to popular belief, lotus leaves are not smooth at all. When examined under a powerful microscope, the leaf cells show a bumpy surface. That makes the surface rough. As a result, dirt particles rest only on the tips of wax crystals coating the leaf surface. The roughness reduces the contact area between the particles and the leaf surface.A rough surface structure with wax crystals makes it impossible for water to stick. Due to the friction, the water contracts at once. It forms spherical droplets to minimise the contact area with the rough, waxy leaf surface and runs off the leaf very quickly. Since the dirt particles only rest on the tips of the wax crystals they stick more strongly to the water droplets than to the leaf surfaces. They are washed away when the water falls on the leaves.On smooth leaves, the dirt particles are pushed from one part of the leaf to the other. This is because the dirt particles have a larger contact area where they can rest comfortably on the flat surface. We must also keep in mind that water usually spreads and only partially runs off the leaves — that too, only if the leaf is tilted! The dirt particles may get dislodged, but they are mainly displaced from one side of the leaf to the other.Scientists say that the Lotus Effect is particularly beneficial for it helps to protect the lotus leaves from harmful bacteria. The dirt particles on the leaves often contain tiny disease causing fungi and bacteria. While most of the bacteria get washed off, the few that remain eventually perish since they do not get the water they require for survival and growth.","keyword":"[\"lotus\", \"leaf\", \"dirt\", \"particle\", \"crystal\", \"surface\"]","ALS":"22"},{"english_id":"565","id":"566","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"How is Paper Perfumed?","article":"Fruity, musk, floral, woodsy… believe it or not, the human nose can detect the difference between nearly 1,000 different odours.

A large West African monkey has simply vanished from the earth. It has joined the Dodo, by becoming the first primate to vanish in the 20th century. After a six-year long survey, scientists and wildlife experts have declared the monkey, known as Miss Waldron’s Red Colobus monkey, extinct.Primatologists (people who study the evolution of apes and monkeys) carried out exhaustive surveys in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, in Africa, but failed to spot a single monkey of the species. The last confirmed sighting of a Miss Waldron’s Red Colobus was over 20 years ago in Ghana’s rainforest. Soon after, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) declared the mammals endangered.Red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus kirki)The Miss Waldron’s Red Colobus was only discovered in 1933. There are five more varieties of the Red Colobus, all of which are rare and are found in Central and Western Africa. Kirk’s Red Colobus Monkey, first identified by Sir John Kirk, (British Resident to Zanzibar in the 1870s) is another animal that is severely endangered.The name ‘Colobus’ is derived from the Latin word for ‘maimed’. That is because Colobus monkeys either have very short thumbs or do not have thumbs at all. Their fur colour ranges from light orange to a fiery orange-red. They are small, about 70 cm at the shoulder, with long limbs and a tasseled tail.These monkeys are brachiates. They swing by their arms through the forest and feed in the upper layers of the forest at a height of about 150 feet.Colobus monkeys are quite timid and live in large, noisy groups. To prove their solidarity, these monkeys groom other members by removing parasites with their mouth. Funnily enough, this act of grooming takes place, more often, in the presence of monkeys from other groups.The monkeys are popular targets for poachers as the meat is considered a delicacy. Human encroachment and the reduction in natural forest habitat are other reasons for the decline of this monkey.Scientists estimate that 10 per cent of the world’s 608 primate species (and subspecies) are endangered. They feel that another 10 per cent may also be endangered unless strict measures are taken for their conservation.","keyword":"[\"monkey\", \"colobus\", \"waldron\", \"ghana\", \"kirk\", \"vanish\"]","ALS":"26.3125"},{"english_id":"573","id":"574","level":"5","topic":"7","title":"It's a Zoo Out There!","article":"Almost 400 years ago, Mughal emperor Jehangir acquired a new animal in his private collection or zoo – the zebra. This unusual, striped animal fascinated him so much that he wrote about it in his memoirs as a strange creature. Some even imagined that the animal’s stripes had been painted!The emperor decided to find out whether the zebra was indeed coloured or not. After much investigation, he made it public that the zebra, too, was a creature created by god. The stripes were natural, they had not been painted upon!All through history, kings and emperors have kept private collections of animals to please themselves and to increase their status. The first zoo of the kind that we are familiar with today, was built in 1759, from such an animal collection, near Vienna, Austria.The first zoo in India, too, probably came from the private collection of Raja Rajendra Mallick in 1854. The Marble Palace Zoo, as it was called, still exists in Calcutta.Not content with establishing the Marble Palace Zoo, Mallick helped found the Alipore Zoological Garden too, which housed birds and animals of different kinds and attracted people from far and wide, according to an article in a beautifully brought out information and activity manual, appropriately called ‘Wild at the Zoo’.Brought out by the Ahmedabad-based Centre for Environment Education, the imaginatively designed book is a storehouse of information that makes us look with new eyes at zoos and at the definition of ‘wild’ animals.Even though Mallick’s zoo came up in 1854, the Madras Zoo, founded in 1855, was perhaps the first zoo to come up in the face of pressure from visitors, according to ‘Wild at the Zoo’. And therein hangs a tale…It’s a Zoo Out There!Colonel Edward Balfour of the Government Central Museum in Madras (now Chennai) had a cheetah and tiger in the museum in 1854, who attracted great attention. The museum recorded a high number of visitors, which dropped once the animals were removed from the museum.Balfour was quick to see the connection and soon enough the Madras Zoo came into being. The zoo shifted to new premises in 1980.Today, there are over 300 zoos in India. They attract as many as 50 million visitors every year, according to the manual.After India attained independence, the first all-India meeting of the people who ran zoos was held in Madras Zoo. Among the issues discussed was the need to design zoos that would first and foremost suit the varied requirements of the animals housed in them. The need to breed endangered animals so they could be reintroduced in the wild and the equally urgent need to educate people about nature and wildlife were discussed as well.‘Wild at the Zoo’ lists out some of the well-known zoos in India: the National Zoological Park in New Delhi, Venkateswara Zoological park in Thirupati in Andhra Pradesh state, Indira Gandhi Zoological park in Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, the Nehru Zoological park in Hyderabad, Arignar Anna Zoological Park at Vandalur, Chennai and the Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Park in Mysore, Karnataka.","keyword":"[\"zoological\", \"madras\", \"park\", \"mallick\", \"museum\", \"wild\"]","ALS":"44.53846153846154"},{"english_id":"574","id":"575","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"Jellyfish: Fragile Creature of the Sea","article":"A sudden influx of jellyfish, in the Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic Ocean is worrying both scientists and fisher folk alike. The Gulf of Mexico is bordered on the north by the United States, on the east by Cuba, and on the south and west by Mexico.Jellyfishes are invertebrates (animals without a spinal column). Some are also venomous and their sting can cause paralysis. However, the Jellyfish that have the fishermen worried are not on a stinging spree. Instead, they are clogging propellers, ripping fishing nets and eating up the sea plankton.The animals are consuming microscopic plankton (the staple diet of fish in the region) and are now posing a serious threat to the Gulf’s ecological balance. The offshore oilrigs, artificial reefs and other man-made structures are providing ideal underwater breeding habitats for jellyfish.Water pollution is yet another reason being cited. The chemicals running into the Gulf of Mexico and from the Mississippi River, feed algae and other microscopic plankton. Jellyfish feed on plankton that in turn feeds on the nitrogen in the water.These animals have been known to live off the Caribbean Sea, but earlier this year, a few made their first appearance in the Gulf. It is believed that the jellyfish came through the Caribbean Sea on the hulls of ships. However, nothing prepared scientists for the sudden appearance of thousands of jellyfish.Jellyfish: Fragile creature of the seaJellyfish have been on earth for over 650 million years – much before dinosaurs and sharks. There are over 200 different species of jellyfish. They come in many shapes and sizes. The largest of them all, known as the Arctic lion’s mane, can reach eight feet across with tentacles that extend over half the length of a football field.A jellyfish has three main parts: the round umbrella-like body (called bell), which propels the animal with a pumping motion; tentacles that sting and immobilise prey; and oral arms (sometimes called flaps) that are used to catch and eat prey.Most jellyfish sting is too weak to hurt humans and only cause a mild irritation. However, there are exceptions like the Australian box jelly. Its toxin is more potent than cobra venom and can kill a person in minutes.Jellyfish are not really fish for they do not have gills. They breathe through their skin. Believe it or not, their bodies consist of more than 95 per cent water. If a jellyfish is placed on the beach, all that will remain, after a few hours, will be a puddle of water.Jellyfish are extremely fragile animals and tend to get stuck and tear easily. If you ever intend to keep a jellyfish as a pet, you’ll have to ensure the aquarium tanks is cylindrical with no corners.","keyword":"[\"jellyfish\", \"gulf\", \"plankton\", \"mexico\", \"feed\", \"caribbean\"]","ALS":"26.789473684210527"},{"english_id":"581","id":"582","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"Man's Best Friend","article":"Who is man’s best friend?

For more than 12,000 years the dog has been a companion, a protector and above all, an honest friend.But different civilisations and cultures have treated the dog in different ways. In some countries, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden, whereas in others they are even eaten as food. However, in most societies, dogs are protected and admired. Ancient Egyptians considered them sacred.Did you know that all dogs were wolves some 12,000 years ago? How is this possible you would ask?Some of the popular dog breedsThe dog storyDogs were the first animals to be domesticated. About 12,000 years ago, humans gave up hunting, gathering and nomadic lifestyle and settled in small settlements.These settlements attracted wolves and wild dogs, which would hang around the settlements to devour the leftovers. Humans in turn, began to rely on the dogs for warning of any approaching danger. Soon, humans found that not only were the dogs excellent hunting partners, but were equally reliable and intelligent.They then started domesticating and breeding (the process of controlled reproduction) those dogs which showed certain useful characteristics. This form of breeding is also called selective breeding.Paleontologists or scientists who study fossil remains, have found out that five distinct types of dogs existed by the beginning of the Bronze Age (about 4500 BC). They were the mastiffs, wolf-type dogs, sight hounds (such as the saluki or greyhound), pointing dogs, and herding dogs.Through the centuries many breeds were developed for specific tasks such as hunting, herding, or guarding. Today, however, most dogs are kept chiefly for companionship.Today there are approximately 400 different breeds of pure-bred dogs in the world. A pure-bred dog is considered to be one whose ancestry can be traced within the same breed for three generations.","keyword":"[\"settlement\", \"breed\", \"domesticate\", \"hunting\", \"breeding\", \"guard\"]","ALS":"24.333333333333332"},{"english_id":"582","id":"583","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Marine Militants: Bioinvasion propagated through Cargo Ships","article":"What would happen if all the lions in Africa are carried away to some other place?

With this population boom, the deer would need more food.After a point, there will no grass left to feed subsequent generations. This would lead to the destruction of the entire ecosystem which thrives and sustains itself on the grass. And the grasslands will turn into a desert.Similarly, if an organism were to reach a place where it finds suitable living conditions but no natural enemies, it would spoil that ecosystem as well. This is exactly what is happening.Marine Militants: Bio-Invasion through Cargo ShipsBio-InvasionShips carry huge loads of cargo which they transport from port to port. When these ships are not carrying cargo, they need something equal to the weight of cargo to move steadily on water. This is done by filling huge tanks called ballast tanks with water.When the ship has to take on the cargo, the ballast tanks are emptied. When these tanks are filled, huge number of marine organisms like bacteria, microbes, fishes, cysts, larvae and crabs get into the tanks.And when the water is pumped out in foreign waters, these organisms land in a new habitat where they flourish. But these new waters seldom have the traditional predators they face in their native areas.In USA, the European zebra mussle, a fresh water mollusc, has infested over 40 percent of internal waterways. In southern Australia, the Asian kelp, an algae, is invading new areas and have displaced native sea bed algae, reports the Down to Earth magazine.These organisms who go without any checks turn into militants, killing and encroaching upon the territory of native animals.

Human sweat turns mosquitoes on more than anything else. Research carried out by scientists in The Netherlands say that mosquitoes are actually quite finicky about whom they sting and never ever nibble at random. They find sweaty people absolutely irresistible however and the more stale the sweat the better. Yuck!Apparently the mosquitoes are attracted by a particular bacterium in human perspiration. However, scientists are yet to identify the bacteria. Once they manage to target the specific chemical, you can be sure they will find an antidote for it, that will help them create a mosquito repellent that works!But it’s not as if all mosquitoes are thirsty for human blood. Some prefer biting birds and nipping flower buds. Even among the species of mosquitoes that do bite us, only the female mosquitoes do the nibbling.Do you know why this is so? Well, they are looking for something called isoleucine (pronounced: iso-lu-seen)- an acid found in our blood. This acid helps female mosquito to lay eggs and she often ends up sucking up to four times her weight in blood.Mosquito MenaceSounds awful? Wait, there’s more. In the process of guzzling blood the female mosquito also injects us with her saliva. This saliva acts as an irritant and causes the bite to itch like crazy. Along with the saliva, many mosquito species also inject infectious microorganisms and transmit diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, and dengue.A female mosquito’s mouthpart is enlarged and well adapted for piercing the skin of mammals (like us) and sucking blood. Their male counterparts on the other hand do not have a complicated mouth structure and are perfectly happy sipping nectar and water.Among mosquitoes too, the female of the species is clearly deadlier than the male.There are approximately 2000 species of mosquitoes worldwide. These insects can be found everywhere- from the Arctic Circle to the Equator; from the lush tropical Amazonian forests to the icy Tundra.

Perhaps a bit of music may perk it up, for it is a known fact that music plays an important role in plant growth. But plants are choosy about the kind of music they want to hear.Experiments show that plants thrive if soothing instrumental music is played in the background. On the other hand they shrivel and die if exposed to heavy metal or rock music. And now a Japanese company has created a gadget that puts you in touch with the ‘feelings’ of plants.This gadget gauges the electrical activity in plants and can register a plant’s response when exposed to music. The device is called the Plantone and has two sensor clips that are attached to the leaves of the plant.When the device’s lamp turns red, it means a strong electrical current has passed within the plant’s cells. It signifies a positive response. A green light on the other hand occurs when the cell electrical signals are weak, signifying a negative or unhappy response.So plants respond to music, but did you know that plants create music, too? Well, a biologist from England, Dr Linda Long, has discovered that the molecular structure of proteins found in plants can be used to create music. The question is how.All living matter contains proteins. Proteins are the basic building blocks of life and are essential for cell growth, muscular movement and transmission of hereditary characteristics.A vine that looks like a clef. Clef is a musical symbol used to indicate the pitch of written notes.Seven sequences for seven notesProteins are made up of a group of an organic compound called amino acids. These amino acids are nothing but combination of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur.Dr. Long grouped these combinations into seven sequences. Then she related the seven sequences with the seven musical notes – a note per sequence.After this she created a software which simply read the structure of a protein and converted it into the corresponding musical notes. They thought they would get random notes; instead the sequence formed a tune.Each protein in a plant has its own specific tune, which means that if an organism has 100 proteins, 100 musical compositions can be created. Dr Long, who plays the keyboard apart from studying plant proteins, has now turned artist.She has made a 25 minute CD called Music of Plants by putting together the tunes created by certain proteins found in the common coriander and mustard plant, among others.For her next musical project she intends to turn the proteins found in the human body into music. And considering the human body has an estimated 30,000 different proteins, she certainly has her work cut out!","keyword":"[\"music\", \"protein\", \"plant\", \"sequence\", \"musical\", \"electrical\"]","ALS":"27.333333333333332"},{"english_id":"587","id":"588","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Mutual Aid Societies","article":"Everywhere in Nature the small, weak and apparently helpless manage to survive by parasitism — sponging off hosts who may in their turn protect and help these hangers-on. Worms, ticks, fleas and various kinds of bacteria are common examples. But there are more spectacular cases among fish and other sea creatures.On riverbeds, a species of fresh water clam tosses her young at passing fish to attach themselves with hooks. The host carries them about, nourishing them until they are adult enough to let go, settle as the bottom, and start another lifecycle. This form of parasitism disperses the clams more widely.Many water creatures who benefit from spongers and hangers-on will go to great lengths to protect them. Deep down in the depths of oceans where light never penetrates, fish identify each other by emitting light. The Photoblehuron and the Anamalopa have space below their eyes for rearing bacteria which are luminous. Opaque screens protect the surrounding tissue from these organisms. If these fish are threatened by larger ones and want to “disappear” they can switch off their light! The microbes in their turn get good from the fish from supplies of oxygenated blood.Indeed, the manner in which some sea creatures take help from each other makes them seem like mutual aid societies. Shrimps maintain “cleaning stations” on some coral reefs. They wave their feelers at huger creatures swimming past who would otherwise gobble them. These bigger fish suffer from itchy skin, festering wounds, dead tissue or parasites. So they are happy to let the shrimps nibble it all away. In the process the cleaners earn themselves a meal.Cleaner-fish render the same service. They work steadily and swiftly, going over their customers quite thoroughly. One cleaner-fish was observed servicing 300 customers in six hours! When experimenters removed all the cleaner fish, their clients moved off to other reefs where “service stations” were available.These larger hosts are often very protective of the cleaners. If a small goby is busy cleaning the teeth of a giant grouper and it sees danger approaching, the grouper partially closes its mouth to hide the goby. Or if the goby is cleaning its grills it will compress them until the predator fish has passed. All large fish who need servicing present themselves to the cleaners, remaining still in the water and opening their mouths wide just as we do in a dentist’s chair.The remora or sucker-fish is a life-long sponger. It has a modified dorsal fin to attach itself to giant sharks and turtles. When its host makes a kill it detaches itself only long enough to snap up morsels of food floating about. It gets free board, lodging, and free passage to travel long distances in the sea without exerting itself. In return for these benefits it cleans its host every now and then, giving the larger fish a thorough treatment.Sea anemones are creatures of prey, their colourful tentacles spread wide to capture passing creatures.

With this discovery, we now know of 50 extra-solar planets, also called exoplanets. That is a big increase from 41 planets last known five years ago.All these individual planets move in an orbit around a star, which is called their parent star. The astronomers estimate that the Beta Pictoris star has a planet ten times the mass of Earth. It orbits at a distance of about 10.5 billion kilometers, more than ten times the distance of the earth from the sun. And Vega, one of the brightest stars in the sky appears to have a planet twice the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. This planet is 8 billion kilometers from its parent star. In comparison, our solar system seems almost tiny. The distance between Pluto, the farthest planet in our solar system and the sun is “just” 5.9 billion kilometers!Besides these two planets, there are two others, which are as big as Saturn. These two orbit very close to their parent star. What is surprising is that one of them takes just 2.98 days to complete a round and the other takes 29.8 days. Now the astronomers have to put on their thinking caps to figure out why one circles the star exactly ten times faster than the other!Stars, planets and galaxy in a free space. ‘Elements of this image furnished by NASA’.Since many extra solar planets are too far away to see directly, astronomers must detect extrasolar planets by carefully watching the stars to see if they “wobble,” or slightly shift their center of mass. Just as the moon has gravitational effects on Earth, and each of the solar system planets has a slight effect on our sun, any large object orbiting a star will tug at the star, causing the star to move slightly.When searching for extrasolar planets, astronomers see a slight shift in a star’s light as an alert that some object — perhaps a planet — may be orbiting it. Several of these stars now seem to show unexplained wobble behaviour, a condition that many scientists think is evidence for second and even third planets orbiting them, according to a report in The Hindu.Geoff Marcy of San Francisco State University told the BBC: “The planets we are finding around other stars, all orbit in elongated, elliptical orbits. It’s quite frightening that virtually all planets that we have found orbit close to their stars where they heat up and then move out to where they cool down,” as reported in Deccan Chronicle.In such a case, water, if it did exist on these planets, would boil and then freeze!

Rhinos are poached for their horns and these are sold in the black market at astonishing prices.Since 1977, trade in rhino horn has been banned but poachers and smugglers still hunt and kill these gentle creatures to meet the demands of the rhino horn in markets in Central Asia and the Far East.For some years now, rhinos have been high on the endangered list. Thankfully, things are looking a lot brighter both for the African white, and for the greater one-horned Asian rhino (more commonly known as the Indian rhino).Rhinoceros: On the Comeback TrailThe white rhino population in Africa has recovered a little over the last twenty years due the rigorous policing by game wardens at the Kruger National Park in South Africa. To deter poachers, game wardens sometimes cut off the horns so that these animals are not unnecessarily killed.According to latest statistics, the Indian rhino species too is making a steady comeback and conversationalists say that Kaziranga National Park in Assam, now houses some 1,600 one-horned rhinos – making it one of the world’s largest rhino reserves.In the past, poachers have operated in isolated parts of the reserve (between 1980 and 1995, about 600 Indian rhinos were killed), but tight security has now overcome this menace. But Kaziranga faces a dire shortage of rangers and wardens to cover the entire sanctuary – only 150 rangers to cover 430 square kilometres of area.Though the odds are heavily in favour of the poachers, villagers living on the periphery of the sanctuary are now being recruited as guards, giving a much needed boost to security. Apparently this arrangement is working out and in the past few months there has been no untoward incident in the sanctuary.The value of rhino horns have increased a thousand fold as people are willing to pay astronomical sums for these horns. Smugglers pay local poachers anything from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000 (1 dollar = Rs 46 in current prices) for a horn and sell it in the international markets at a whopping Rs. 1.5 million per kilogram! (Considering at an average, a full-grown rhino horn weighs about two to three kilograms, the stakes are extremely high).The horn is in great demand in East Asia and China as it is believed that the horns have medicinal value while sometimes the poached horn is used to make handles of daggers.China is the main producer of medicines containing rhino horn with factories illegally using about 650 kilos of horn a year. A rhino horn is believed to cure a wide range of illnesses from skin diseases to heart trouble and is even considered an aphrodisiac, but scientists and doctors scoff at the idea and say that there is no proof that rhino horn is indeed beneficial.Although the rhinoceros family was once widespread today only five species exist: three in Asia and two in Africa.","keyword":"[\"rhino\", \"horn\", \"poacher\", \"warden\", \"smuggler\", \"kaziranga\"]","ALS":"44.416666666666664"},{"english_id":"598","id":"599","level":"5","topic":"7","title":"Robot That Changes Form","article":"Did you know that the word robot is derived from the Czech word robota? It means compulsory labour or work. The word robot was first used in a Czech drama in 1921. It described a mechanical device that looked human but lacked emotions. It worked mechanically.Modern-day robots do not necessarily look like humans. But they are programmed to handle tasks that are normally carried out by humans, especially in big factories that manufacture products like cars. Employers prefer these mechanical devices because of many reasons: they are faster and more accurate than human workers; they never ask for a pay hike; nor do they take endless coffee breaks! Robots are also capable of working in an environment that is dangerous for humans.Robots on the factory floor, building a carThey can be found in many places — sorting out bolts in factories, digging a mineshaft, collecting soil samples on the planet Mars, and photographing the ocean floor. Now robots are all set to take over the hospital floor too. No, not as doctors, but as couriers.Usually, big hospitals have attendants scurrying around to deliver medicines and bottles to different wards. Researchers at the University of Arkansas in the United States say that the mobile robots they have created, are ideal for the job of hospital attendants. They insist that their robotic couriers will save the hospitals millions of dollars in the long run.These mobile robots, known as HelpMates, store a detailed map of the hospital in their memory. They are mobile and are programmed to avoid obstacles and people. The robots’ sensors can detect a human’s approach and quickly get out of the way. Unlike humans, these robots cannot navigate staircases. But, yes, they know how to press a button for the elevator. They travel up the floors in style!Researchers at a Massachusetts university have gone a step further. They are creating a robot that can constantly change its shape according to the task it has to do. These robots are called polymorphic robots. Polymorphic means the ability to take different forms.How does the robot change its form any number of times? There is a 3D printer placed inside the robot. This printer uses a nozzle to build up layers of thermoplastic to create the desired shape. Thermoplastic is a kind of plastic that softens upon heating and hardens when cooled.The entire process of changing form in this manner is called the rapid prototyping technology. It is fairly common in the car industry and is used to produce complex three-dimensional structures quickly.Once the robot has performed its task, it can be melted down. Its thermoplastic parts can then be recycled into another useful gadget by the 3D printer… The polymorphic robot is a classic case of form according to function.","keyword":"[\"robot\", \"hospital\", \"polymorphic\", \"thermoplastic\", \"printer\", \"mobile\"]","ALS":"20.44"},{"english_id":"600","id":"601","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"Save rivers, lakes from worshippers","article":"Before every Ganesh Chaturthi, people from across India, especially Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, get busy with preparations for celebrations.

But it is not as if nothing is being done about the problem. This year (2001), civic authorities and festival organisers in Mumbai and Pune tried to ensure that the Ganesha idols were not immersed in water and dug pits for offerings to be deposited.Perhaps the rest of India should take similar initiatives, the CPCB officials feel.

Why does paper float on water and a paperweight sink? The answer to these questions was accidentally discovered 2200 years ago by the Greek inventor and mathematician, Archimedes.One day, while getting into his bath he noticed water spilling over the sides. In a flash, Archimedes realised the relation between the water that had fallen out and the weight of his body – in other words he discovered why some objects float and some sink! Archimedes was so excited with his discovery that he hopped out of the bath, and rushed naked into the street yelling triumphantly, ‘Eureka!’ ‘Eureka!’ (Greek word for ‘I have found it!).Archimedes Principle – EurekaArchimedes discovery, now popular as the Archimedes’ principle, explains why steel ships, weighing thousands of tons, float. But what is Archimedes’ principle? When a body is immersed in water, it experiences a force (known as the buoyancy force).This force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the body. For instance, a lump of steel will sink for it is unable to displace water that equals its weight. But steel of the same weight but shaped as a bowl, will float. This is because the weight gets distributed over a larger area and the steel displaces water equal to its weight. So a heavily laden ship floats because its total weight is exactly equal to the weight of the water it displaces. It is this weight that exerts the buoyant force supporting the ship.Archimedes is also known for his extensive work in geometry; and the invention of the lever and pulley. He also created a range of mechanical devices for the defense of his homeland – the catapult and a mirror system (for focusing the sun’s rays on an enemy’s boat causing it to catch fire).In a rare find, scientists have recently managed to unearth a manuscript, the only surviving copy that contains Archimedes’ theory of flotation and some mechanical theorems. Particularly interesting is the fact that in many parts of the manuscript, Archimedes gives detailed explanations using diagrams. Researchers now hope to get a valuable insight into how Archimedes’ mind worked and how he went about devising his abstract theorems.According to historians, Archimedes probably wrote his manuscript on papyrus scrolls, fragile in nature. About a 1,000 years later, the documents were copied onto leather sheets and bound into a book form, to prevent their deterioration.In the Middle Ages about 1000 years ago, in Europe, Christian monks frequently recycled parchment works. The contents of the parchment held little interest for the monks, but they needed writing materials, so they tore apart the original manuscript.The writing was erased by scraping the skin and the pages were cut in half and recycled into a Christian book of religious instructions. The new words were written sideways across the original text. Such works became known as ‘palimpsests’ (Greek for ‘scraped again’). The manuscript that is currently under study at a university in New York is called the Archimedes Palimpsest.For 700 years, it remained in Palestine and Constantinople, cities that were once centers of learning. In 1906 a Danish scholar discovered the barely legible original text underneath. The book disappeared again around 1920 only to surface in an auction house as recently as 1998.Now scientists are piecing together the cut pages and are using ultraviolet and infrared filters to capture images of the original words. Both infrared and ultraviolet light penetrate the surface text and get reflected. The reflected text is recorded on camera and reveals details that aren’t evident to the naked eye. The job is quite complicated, but scientists hope to decipher the writing soon.","keyword":"[\"archimedes\", \"weight\", \"text\", \"manuscript\", \"float\", \"steel\"]","ALS":"26.846153846153847"},{"english_id":"603","id":"604","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"Sea Turtles","article":"Can you name an animal that returns to the place of its birth, every single year, journeying more than 1,000 km to do so? Well, here is another hint: this animal is a sea creature that originated on earth more than 200 million years ago- making the species older than the oldest ever dinosaur.Give up? They are none other than marine turtles, more commonly known as sea turtles. Seven existing species of sea turtles exist in the world today of which at least four (the Olive Ridley, Green Hawksbill, Leatherback and Flatback) are fairly common in the waters of the Indian Ocean. The sea turtle, or the Leatherback is the largest living turtle. It can grow up to a length of six feet and is known to weigh about 700 kgs!The leatherback sea turtle, sometimes called the lute turtle, is the largest of all living turtles and is the fourth largest reptileSea turtles live mostly in warm waters around the world and are graceful swimmers, with limbs modified into long flippers that enable them to migrate long distances. Among the many natural phenomena that we are yet to understand, is the mass nesting by sea turtles, known as ‘arribada’.The word ‘arribada’ is derived from the Spanish word ‘arribadas’ which means ‘arrival’. There are four such mass nesting sites (or arribada sites) in the world- two in Costa Rica, one in Mexico and the largest in Gahirmatha beach on the Orissa coast.Each year, from December to April, Gahirmatha plays host to hundreds and thousands of female Olive Ridley turtles. These turtles lay their eggs on the same beach where they were born. Turtles always return to the same nesting site year after year, even if they migrate thousands of kilometres. This particular phenomenon has baffled scientists for years now and no one has any clue as to why they do so.Sea turtles rarely venture out of the deep and they never seem to have a permanent habitat for they are continuously on the move. Unlike the male Olive Ridleys who prefer the anonymity (and safety) of the sea, female Olive Ridleys brave predators as they drag themselves to the shore to lay their eggs. Each year more than one lakh Olive Ridley turtles lay about 100 eggs each in the sands of Gahirmatha beach.Mama turtle lays her eggs in pits and covers them with sand using her flippers. However the slightest disturbance can result in mama turtle returning to the sea without laying eggs. Her task complete, she heads off to the sea, only to return next year to the very same beach, again during the nesting season.Meanwhile the eggs are easy targets for predators. Stray dogs often manage to ferret out the catch and gobble up the eggs. Those that aren’t eaten hatch after 50-70 days and the teeny baby Olive Ridleys immediately begin moving towards the sea. How do they do that?Researchers and biologists say that the hatchlings are attracted by the bright horizon or the moonlight sparkling on the water. Recent studies show that the glow of neon lights and brightly lit buildings has been misleading the babies, making them lose their bearings.In the last few years, the number of turtles nesting at Gahirmatha (and the smaller adjoining beaches) has reduced. Environmentalists point out that the indiscriminate fishing by local villagers results in turtles getting entangled in the huge nets and few fisherfolk release the animal back safely. Instead, they kill it and toss the carcass into the water.Protests by wildlife activists forced the government to take action and in the year 1998, Gahirmatha became a protected wildlife sanctuary with the coast guard and the forest department monitoring the coastal waters.","keyword":"[\"turtle\", \"ridley\", \"olive\", \"gahirmatha\", \"arribada\", \"leatherback\"]","ALS":"32.476190476190474"},{"english_id":"610","id":"611","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Spiders and their Magical Web","article":"Most of us have come across cobwebs that accumulate in our walls, and ceilings when we dust our homes. The webs are under tables, cellars, and sometimes across branches and leaves at the park. All these cobwebs are the work of spiders.Spider webs are fine silken threads. Originally spiders spun silk to protect their eggs and to line their nests. But later they adapted to use this silk to weave a web and trap their prey. Sometimes it is also used to provide a safety line so that if they fall, they get suspended in the air.But despite all this evidence, most spiders do not spin webs. They rely on their speed – like the common house spider – and mobility to catch their prey or to steer away from danger. Spiders that don’t spin webs are sometimes venomous as they lurk in burrows, trees and buildings until their prey comes to them. These spiders rely on speed and surprise rather than webs.A spider spinning its webNearly all the world’s 40,000 species of spiders originated from marine creatures about 400 million years ago. But these spiders have changed themselves through a process called adaptive radiation. This means that spiders have evolved to fit their surroundings and environment according to the changes in nature, food and climate.Spiders are not insects. Biologists classify them as ‘arachnids’. Arachnids are different from insects as they have eight legs and no antennae. Scorpions, mites and ticks also come in this category.Spider webs are extremely light and incredibly strong. They are finer than silk but have a breaking strain greater than that of steel. The silk of the golden orb spider found across the world is the strongest known natural fibre.Different kinds of spiders spin and weave different webs. The trapdoor spider makes a trip line, across which insects trip and alerts the spider. The trip line is similar to a piece of thread stretched at a height of ten inches across a doorway. Since we don’t expect any barrier we tend to trip on this line and fall down.Closeup of a jumping spiderThe American black widow spins a tangled web and attaches it to the ground or a tree like an anchor while stretch a fine sticky line of thread to their hideout. Unsuspecting insects get caught in the web and the spider hauls them in.The net-throwing spiders weave a web like a napkin holding it with their front four legs like a fisherman ready to throw his net. They lunge on to their prey and capture them in the net. The more the prey struggles the more the victim gets imprisoned.However, the bolas spiders adopt the most interesting technique. The bolas spider dangles a large sticky globule (thick mass) at the end of a single line of silk thread. The globule attracts moths. When the spider senses the vibrations of the wings, it twirls the globule faster and faster like a bolas, and traps the moth on this lump of bait. It then lures the moth up like a fisherman landing a fish!Spiders are unique in other ways. They can detect infrasonic sounds (Human hearing is between 20 to 20,000 hertz. Anything above 20,000 hertz is called ultrasonic and anything below is called infrasonic.) caused naturally by earthquakes and some respond to sounds above 45,000 hertz.All spiders except spiders of the Uloboridae family are venomous. The potency of the poison varies from specie to specie. While some can kill the prey, others paralyse the prey.Spider bites are rarely fatal to humans. They may cause pain or sickness but rarely death. However, in the rare case of the Australian funnel-web spider, animals manage to survive the bite while the poison is fatal to humans!","keyword":"[\"spider\", \"spin\", \"silk\", \"prey\", \"bola\", \"globule\"]","ALS":"20.636363636363637"},{"english_id":"615","id":"616","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"The Baby Current Which Destroys","article":"Did you know that the period between November 1997 and November 1998 was the hottest year recorded on earth? In fact, six of the first eight months of the year were the warmest since humans began recording temperatures on earth in 1866.Weather experts say one of the causes behind the warming of the earth’s atmosphere, or global warming, is El Nino, a water current in the Pacific Ocean.But why should a water current create heat in the earth’s atmosphere, one would ask.Actually, water currents could be hot or cold depending on their origin, their speed and the pull of gravity at a particular point in the sea. Swimmers say that they have come across places which are distinctly hot, or cold in different parts of the same sea.El Nino is a very powerful current. It flows from New Guinea and the Micronesian islands some 14,000 km across the Pacific to coastal regions of Peru. It usually lasts between fourteen and eighteen months, and may vanish for three to eight years.But when it flows, it moves huge amounts of really warm water. As it does so, it heats the water above. The heated water shifts to the north and south. It piles up off South America, leaving colder currents in the western Pacific. The warmth of the water actually affects the weather of the place it reaches.Besides, the Pacific Ocean is equal in area to all the landmasses on earth combined. Naturally, whatever happens here can influence the world weather. And El Nino’s role in changes in weather has already been proved. In February 1992, there were floods in southern California. Satellite images showed that there was a clear link between El Nino and the floods.The origins of El Nino are not really known. It is said that it is caused by volcanoes on or just below the sea bed. It is believed that the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, in the Philippines, triggered El Nino that year. But no one really knows for sure.EL Nino was first discovered by fishermen based at Spanish ports along the Pacific coast of South America in the 17th century. They named it El Nino, which means Christ child, because it flows during Christmas time. But not every year.El Nino is not the only water current which creates havoc on the weather. Another water current called La Nina is believed to have caused fierce storms in northern Europe, a deluge in Australia and a drought in parts of South America. But, unlike El Nino, La Nina is a cold Pacific current. La Nina is believed to be the sister of El Nino.","keyword":"[\"nino\", \"pacific\", \"nina\", \"weather\", \"south\", \"warming\"]","ALS":"22.136363636363637"},{"english_id":"620","id":"621","level":"5","topic":"11","title":"The Deadly King Cobra","article":"Belonging to the family Elapidae, the name Cobra is popularly applied to African and Asian snakes that are capable of spreading long ribs in their necks into a hood when threatened. There are six species of cobras: the Naja, the south African ringhal (Hemachatus), king cobra (Ophiophagus), water cobra (Boulengerina), tree cobra (Pseudohaje), and shield-nose cobra (Aspidelaps).The king cobra or Hamadryad holds a record length of 5.58 m (18.3ft) for a venomous snake.It has a head as big as a man’s hand and can stand tall enough to look you straight in the eye. The hood plays a big part in its fearsome ‘threat posture’. The king cobra can stand up to one third of its total length or from 3 to 6 ft height and has the ability to move forward in the intimidating posture. An upright posture without the hood extended is normally a friendly gesture and the snake often assumes this pose to see over bushes or tall grasses.Its deadly fangs are almost half-an-inch long. And the venom could stun your nervous system and stop your breathing. If the venom comes in contact with the human eyes, it can cause an immediate and severe irritation of the conjunctiva and cornea that, if untreated, could result in permanent blindness. Incidentally, the king’s venom is actually less lethal than a common cobra’s. However, the king makes up for it by delivering more venom per bite as much as 7 millimetres of liquid — which is enough to kill an elephant or 20 people.Despite being colour blind, the King cobra’s eyesight is better than most snakes. It can see a moving person almost 330 ft away.King cobras actually do hear thereby debunking the common misconception that snakes are audibly challenged due to the absence of external ears. Sound travels from the skin to the jaw muscle to the quadrate bone next to the ear bone. From there, sound waves pass on to the inner ear. Nevertheless, the responses to a snake charmer’s flute are due to visual cues.The King cobra’s hissing sounds more like a dog’s growl and is much lower than most snakes. The hiss is produced by tiny holes in the trachea, which is resonated by the lung.They are cannibals. Besides eating non-venomous snakes like the rat snakes, they also dine on venomous Indian cobras, kraits and even small King cobras.With no cutting teeth they gulp down every meal. The cobra’s digestive tract is like a long straight tube. Blunt teeth puncture the food and the venom’s enzymes start the digestive process. From the long stomach, food travels through the small intestine, the large intestine and then out of the cloaca.Snakes generally shed their skin when they grow too big for the old skin in a process called ecdysis. A King cobra sheds 4 to 6 times a year in a two-week shedding cycle. However, in the first year they shed every month. During the shedding time, the king drinks a lot of water to help separate the itchy old skin from the new one underneath. It then rubs against the rough edges to start the peeling process. Besides the new skin, the King uncovers new fangs, teeth and tongue.A King cobra’s colour varies from olive brown to grey to deep shiny black depending upon the habitat. Despite its aggressive reputation, the King cobra is actually more cautious than many smaller snakes. It only attacks people when it is cornered or in self-defence or to protect its eggs. They appear to be much more intelligent than other cobras.During the mating season, the potential mates find each other by sending scent messages. Both male and females give off a musk smell in the mating season.About 2 months after mating, the queen lays a clutch of 20-40 eggs. She will guard these for about 2 more months. The King cobras are the only snakes that make nests for their eggs. The nest consists of mounds of leaves and debris that the queen whips together. Just before the babies emerge, the mother leaves. When they hatch, the brightly marked hatchlings are raring to go. About 14 inches long and as thick as your little finger, they emerge self-sufficient. Their venom is as potent as an adult King cobra.King cobras are usually found in India, Vietnam, southern China, Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. One of King cobra’s natural habitats is the cool undergrowth of rain forests. It stays near streams where temperature and humidity are relatively constant. However deforestation, often due to growing populations and agriculture, is shrinking the King’s native habitat.Hindus consider cobras as manifestation of Lord Shiva — god of destruction and regeneration. Besides, its aggressive reputation and its lethal defences have inspired people to view its powers as god-like. In India, since time immemorial, people have revered King cobras and placed them at the center of their most scared rites.","keyword":"[\"cobra\", \"snake\", \"venom\", \"posture\", \"hood\", \"mating\"]","ALS":"23.76923076923077"},{"english_id":"621","id":"622","level":"5","topic":"16","title":"The Earth Is Getting dimmer","article":"If you have viewed a crescent moon on a clear night, you would have observed an eerie glow around the moon. This is called earthshine. Do you know why the moon glows?The eerie glow around a crescent moon is called earthshine.Our earth and the moon act as giant mirrors that reflect sunlight. Actually most objects reflect light. A mirror reflects almost all the light that falls on it. And an object that does not reflect light is called opaque.The sun’s rays contain heat and light, which keep the earth warm. However, our earth reflects as much as 30 percent of the heat and light that falls on it. This is how our earth manages to keep its temperature under control.A lot of the reflected light reaches the moon, which, in turn, reflects it back to earth. The light that is reflected back from the moon makes it glow.Global warming and earthshineScientists are now using this reflected light or earthshine as a thermometer to monitor earth’s health.New observations conducted at southern California’s Big Bear Solar Observatory suggest that the earth has dimmed by about 2.5 percent over the past five years. Which means it is not as bright as it was earlier. This decrease in the earth’s brightness, they point out, is connected to the increase in the global temperature.In the last century, humans have burned large amounts of fossil fuels like petrol and diesel for their energy needs. These fossil fuels are mostly made up of an element called carbon. The burning of the fuels has released a lot of carbon into the earth’s atmosphere.Carbon has a tendency to absorb heat and light. The extra amount of carbon in the earth’s atmosphere has increased the amount of heat and light it absorbs. As a result, the earth is getting warmer and is not reflecting as much light as it used to. Therefore, it is getting dimmer. Consequently, the earthshine is losing its brightness.Steven Koonin, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, points out that earthshine could reveal how hot our planet is becoming.“It’s really amazing, if you think about it, that you can look at this ghostly reflection on the Moon and measure what Earth’s climate is doing”, says Koonin in an article in the National Geographic web site – www.nationalgeographic.com.","keyword":"[\"reflect\", \"moon\", \"earthshine\", \"earth\", \"glow\", \"fuel\"]","ALS":"25.705882352941178"},{"english_id":"622","id":"623","level":"5","topic":"16","title":"The Earth takes a Battering","article":"During its life span, our planet has suffered the impact of close to 30 small planets, up to 10 miles in diameter and travelling 60 times the speed of sound.

The bin is made of plastic or wood and has small holes to allow good ventilation. The owners need to create the proper environment for the worms and line the bin with worm castings, shredded newspaper and fruit and veggie peels.Of course, they need worms.

Mumbai too has its share of vermiculture units, with the Bal Bhavan (an educational institute) taking an interest in the technology.There is a small garden near Hassaram Rijhumal College (Churchgate, Mumbai) which has a vermiculture pit and which uses worm castings for manure. Interestingly, Japan imports 3000-million tonnes of earthworm per annum for vermiculture projects in the country. However, India still has a long way to go before vermiculture becomes popular among the masses.","keyword":"[\"worm\", \"earthworm\", \"vermiculture\", \"casting\", \"waste\", \"decompose\"]","ALS":"34.833333333333336"},{"english_id":"625","id":"626","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"The Exotic Peacock","article":"Come monsoons, and we immediately think about the beautiful peacock, dancing in the rain, with its luscious tail spread out behind it. Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful birds in the world and a native of the Indian sub-continent, it is not surprising that the Peacock was anointed as the national bird of India in 1963.Hailing from the pheasant family, these exotic birds are cherished for their colourful plumes and eggs. The peacocks, more appropriately called peafowls, (peacock refers to the male) are found in lowland forests and hills usually in small groups consisting of one male and several females.Peafowls are long-legged birds. The male, known as the peacock, has a blue head with green and purple highlights and a crown-like tuft. Its face has white stripes and the back is green and blue with black undersides. The extraordinarily long tails of males have strong shafts and magnificent colours and extend far beyond the tail, which has twenty feathers. They form a train with oscillate designs and the fan is supported by hidden tail feathers which are much shorter. The primary feathers and tail are of chestnut colour and the train is green with bronze and is covered with blue and green spots that appear to be eyes. The females look quite dowdy in comparison. They do not have the train but have a crown-like tuft.Though they can fly strongly for short distances, peafowls rarely fly. They are terrestrial and roost at nights.Omnivorous by nature, they obtain most of their food by scratching the leaf litter with their strong feet. They eat anything from seeds, grains to small reptiles. They enjoy eating young cobras.Peafowls are polygamous and live in small families. Interestingly the mating season of peacocks coincides with the monsoon season in India. During monsoons, the male and female let out a meowing call which is commonly interpreted as `minh- ao’, which means there will be rain. With the onset of the mating season, the male displays its full trail of feathers to the females. After mating, the peahen makes a nest in the underbush and lays 4 to 8 eggs, which are incubated for about 28 days. The young ones are watched over by the peahen until they can take care of themselves.Portrait of peacock dancing with its feathers openKnown for their fierce, lively and courageous tempers, the males do not get along with one another and when faced with danger the peafowls become very aggressive.There are three types of peafowls. The Indian or blue peafowl, the green peafowl of Burma and IndoChina and a rare and aberrant form, the Congo peacock, found in the forests of Congo basin in Africa.Several myths and legends have been spun around these elegant birds. Peacocks can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman mythologies. It was supposed to be the favourite bird of Goddess Juno. In India, peacocks are associated with Lord Krishna and Karthikeyan.","keyword":"[\"peacock\", \"peafowl\", \"feather\", \"male\", \"tail\", \"green\"]","ALS":"24.318181818181817"},{"english_id":"626","id":"627","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"The Fish Which Changes From Female to Male","article":"There is a fish called the blackspot angelfish, which can change from female to male. No, it cannot do it by simply wishing to become male. The change happens for a specific reason.The angel fish live in groups. And each group has one male fish, which is blue in colour, and four female fish, which are yellow in colour.The male angelfish is the strongest and largest member of the group. He is the one who protects and looks after the females and acts like their ‘security guard’. When the male dies, the group needs a ‘security guard’. This is when the largest female fish in the group begins to change its appearance.Blackspot Angelfish: A tropical marine fish which can change from female to maleShe begins to grow larger in size. After a week, she starts changing colour, from yellow to blue. Slowly, her behaviour towards the females changes. She begins behaving like a male. Two weeks later, black stripes appear on her body. This indicates that the gender change is complete. She is now completely male!This process of changing gender is called hermaphroditism.Another interesting fact about angelfish is that they have an occupation in the fish world. Most of them act as ‘cleaners’ for other fish. They pick parasites and dead tissue from the body of other fish.The angel fish are among the most brightly coloured fish of the sea. You can also see them in home aquaria. People prefer to keep them because of the interesting patterns on them. These patterns help them to hide from predators. Often, the young ones are differently coloured than the adults.At night, when these fish become inactive, their colours may change. Among the better-known species are the black and gold angelfish of the Indo-Pacific, the French angelfish, Pomacanthus paru (or P. arcuatus), a black and yellow species of the Atlantic, and the queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris), a blue and yellow fish of the Atlantic.They can be found in the freshwaters of South America, in warm seas and coral reefs and can grow up to a length of 17 inches. They usually swim singly or in pairs. They have thinly compressed bodies and a strong spine located in the lower part of the cheekbone. Their diet consists mainly of sponge and algae.","keyword":"[\"angelfish\", \"fish\", \"male\", \"female\", \"angel\", \"gender\"]","ALS":"18.869565217391305"},{"english_id":"629","id":"630","level":"5","topic":"2","title":"The Hows and Whys of Bubble Gum","article":"Chew this question: What is small and pink, tastes sweet, can be chewed for hours without it dissolving, yet is not to be swallowed? Some doctors feel that it helps to relieve stress. Others think it is good for the teeth. Americans are constantly rolling it about in their mouth and the US army gives it as part of field rations. No guesses for the correct answer. Yes, it is chewing gum or bubble gum as it is often called because you can blow large bubbles that go ‘pop’!Ancient Greeks in 50 A.D. chewed resin, similar to gum, taken from the bark of the mastic tree. Thousands of years ago, the Mayans of Mexico chewed a substance called chicle, a rubbery substance, extracted from the sapodilla tree that grows mainly in Central America. European settlers quickly learnt the art of chewing the sap of the spruce tree from the Native Americans.From sap they chewed on to sweetened paraffin wax, which often broke up into tiny pieces. But it was the famous Mexican general Santa Anna who introduced chicle to the Americans. When he settled in New York in 1869 he introduced the chewy chicle to Thomas Adams, a local chemist.Adams tried to make chicle into rubber but he didn’t succeed. In 1870, Adams introduced “Black Jack”, the first manufactured flavoured gum that is still sold today. Chicle, like rubber bands, doesn’t dissolve when you chew on it. Instead, it gets softer the more it is chewed in the warmth of your mouth.In the late 1880s, two brothers, Frank and Henry Fleer, entered the chewing gum business. Henry covered chicle with a white candy coating and developed what is known now as Chiclets. Meanwhile, in 1906, Frank developed a sticky gum that he called Blibber-Blubber bubble gum.The Market Theater Gum Wall is a local landmark in downtown Seattle. This brick alleyway wall is covered in used chewing gum which is several inches thick at places.The Blibber-Blubber gum failed as it was too sticky and in 1928, Walter Diemer, an accountant for Fleer invented the modern bubble gum. Bubble gums consist of sugar, corn syrup, softeners, flavouring and latex to make it stretch.The first bubble gum was pink in colour as it was the only colour available. He called it the Dubble Bubble gum and the name stuck to it like gum. Though bubble gums come in all colours, pink is still the most popular color sold today.Until the 1940s, chewing gum was still made of chicle. But soon chemists learned to make artificial gum and replaced chicle. These gum bases are essentially synthetic rubbers that resemble chicle. They are both natural and artificially made, and mixed with sugar and other flavourings to make chewing gum. The flavouring is released in the mouth as you chew the gum.Parents normally worry that the gum will stick to the stomach if swallowed and cause digestive problems. Or that the child may choke as the gum may stick to the windpipe!Although chewing gum sticks easily to hair, shoe soles and is commonly stuck to the bottom of theatre seats, the gum cannot stick to the moist inner lining of the stomach or intestines. It passes right through without a problem. Yes, it does take a while for it to come out, but it certainly comes out!Most people are not aware that chewing gum is a fibre like the skins of fruit and vegetables, but they chew it nonetheless.If ever you have the misfortune to get gum stuck in your hair or shoes, rubbing it with peanut butter will help remove it. To remove gum from your shirt or pant, apply an ice cube so it hardens and then chip it off. But if you insist on blowing huge bubbles to set a record, be prepared to have some gum sticking to your face as it pops!","keyword":"[\"chew\", \"chicle\", \"bubble\", \"stick\", \"pink\", \"rubber\"]","ALS":"25.785714285714285"},{"english_id":"630","id":"631","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"The Importance of the Mangrove Forest","article":"Tropical coastlines and marshy areas around the world have one thing in common: mangrove forests. These consist of trees and shrubs that throw out many prop roots and sustain a large variety of aquatic animals, birds and plants. These mangroves form a complete ecosystem. That is, they provide a complete base for all the organisms within that environment to live and thrive. That keeps the balance in the larger environment of which humans are a vital part. Marshy and swampy tidal areas near seas and estuaries, where rivers empty into the sea, are ideal for mangrove forests.Mangrove forests act as nurseries for many marine species, they protect coastlines, and they regulate sea temperatures within their proximity.The prop roots have one function. They support the mangroves in the ever moving loose sand, as sea water flows over it.All types of aquatic life forms can be seen in these mangroves — turtles, crabs, shrimps, lobsters, prawns, fish, storks, egrets and cranes, among others. Algae, which is the green scum on the water, is a source of food for many fish.Underwater image of a mangrove-forest: the Importance of the Mangrove ForestThe mangrove belt is very important to humans. For, like the coconut, cashew and casuarina trees, it provides protection to the coastline from the rough seawaters and prevents soil erosion. During a cyclone or tidal wave, a mangrove belt faces the fury of wind and water and minimises the destruction on the coastline. The tidal forest is a rich source of biomass (organic matter that is used to produce energy).A mangrove tree in waterBut, not surprisingly, this rich aquatic ecosystem is under threat from humans. Land is being reclaimed from the sea for industrial and commercial purposes. Increase in shrimp farming has led to a decline in mangrove forests. Laws have been enacted to protect these forests, but the plunder continues.","keyword":"[\"mangrove\", \"coastline\", \"tidal\", \"aquatic\", \"forest\", \"marshy\"]","ALS":"25.071428571428573"},{"english_id":"633","id":"634","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"The Plastic Menace","article":"Heavy rains lashed Mumbai city a few months ago, the worst rains in decades. The downpour literally brought the city to a standstill. And all because of discarded plastic bags. Plastic bags or polythene bags are essentially made of petro-chemicals.These bags are very thin and in a strong wind can fly away from garbage bins and land on drains and rain-water channels. The bags then clog the drains as they do not let water to flow through.The choked gutters and drains in Mumbai caused serious water logging and flooding. Fortunately the rain and the flooding did have a positive aspect – it made the Mayor of Mumbai sit up and take notice of the plastic bag menace in the city.An immediate ban on thin plastic bags was declared. The ban came into effect on August 15, India’s Independence Day. The Mumbai Municipal Corporation workers were called in to help enforce the ban. They were told to seize bags that do not conform to the standards (all bags thinner than 20 microns or 2 x 10-5 metre thickness).The squads were given power to fine defaulters a sum of up to Rs 2,000 ($1 equals Rs 46). Within the first two days itself they seized 8,000 kg of plastic bags and recovered Rs 1.5 million in fines.Plastic bags are non-biodegradable, that is, they take years to disintegrate and decompose. Many animals, like cows and pigs, die as they unknowingly swallow these bags while eating. Coloured plastic bags are even more dangerous. Chemical dyes like cadmium and lead are used to colour these bags and the chemicals affect the kidneys or our bones.Plastic waiting to be recycledBut why ban only thin polythene bags. Why not all plastic bags? The fact is most shopkeepers use thin plastic bags. Thick plastic bags are very expensive and cost four times more than the thin variety. Thin bags are of very poor quality and can rarely be reused. As a result, these flimsy bags land up in drains and gutters.Of course thicker plastic bags are unsafe too, but at least they can be recycled. Many shopkeepers say they cannot afford thick plastic bags. Paper packets, which are the only alternative, are just not strong enough.Some Indian companies have now come forward with a proposal to make paper bags that are laminated with a thin sheet of plastic that is environmental friendly. They claim that this bio-plastic, made of natural products, decomposes within a month.But scientists say that these bio-plastics are not completely degradable. They are usually a combination of 50% natural material (that decomposes easily) and 50% non-degradable chemicals. So only half the sheet actually disintegrates within a month.The fight against plastic bags continues and the only way we can do our bit is by refusing to accept plastic bags. So try and take a jute (or cloth) bag the next time you go to the market.","keyword":"[\"plastic\", \"mumbai\", \"drain\", \"polythene\", \"flooding\", \"seize\"]","ALS":"22.125"},{"english_id":"635","id":"636","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"The Secrets of the Ocean Floor","article":"It is one question that is not a quizmasters’ favourite: which is the tallest mountain on earth? The answer is bound to come fast and snappy – Mt Everest, at a height of 29,000 feet.But that is only on land. For, if you were to measure from the bottom of the ocean, the tallest mountain in the world will probably be Mauna Kea in Hawaii. It rises more than 15,748 feet under the sea and another 13,779 feet above it. The total comes to more than 29, 527 feet.There are such deep trenches in the deep sea that a mountain like Everest could disappear into them without a trace! (A trench is a long, narrow, steep depression in the ocean floor).The Secrets of the Ocean FloorBut, as US marine scientist Cindy Lee Dover points out in her eloquent book, ‘Deep Ocean Journeys: Discovering New Life at the Bottom of the Sea’ (1996), the seafloor is the “largest and least known wilderness on our planet. We know more about the surface of Mars and Venus and the back side of the moon than we know about the seafloor.”And that is a real tragedy, as she points out. For, there is reason to believe that every process that is taking place on the ocean floor tells us about the processes that were responsible for the shaping of the earth’s surface as we know. “If we are to understand the geological forces that shape our planet, we must understand the geological processes expressed by features on the seafloor, says Dover.The scientist has travelled to the depths of the ocean to explore the various kinds of complex creatures living in the deep waters near volcanic vents that could function as models for sites where life might have originated on earth.The statistics she gives are startling: that the lava produced by underwater volcanoes in a year is enough to cover an area four times the size of Alaska with one metre of lava! More than one million volcanoes occur in the Pacific Ocean Basin alone, but less than one per cent of these volcanoes have been studied and monitored. That means, less than one per cent of the planet’s seafloor has been mapped, explains Dover.That is why, most of the fauna belonging to the deepwaters are not familiar to even scientists. Many of them perhaps do not even have names. But the richness of these deep-sea ecosystems can rival that of the tropical rainforests.Some of the names given by scientists to freshly discovered animals are really funny, says Dover. Among them are the spaghetti worms, named as such because of their resemblance to the eatable. Found in a tangle, it is often difficult to make out where one ends and another begins! Just like spaghetti, one might add.At the time of the book’s publication, Dover was working as a visiting investigator at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, a pioneer in deep-sea research since the 60s.","keyword":"[\"ocean\", \"dover\", \"seafloor\", \"volcano\", \"spaghetti\", \"deep\"]","ALS":"34.5"},{"english_id":"640","id":"641","level":"5","topic":"11","title":"The Tiny World of Ants","article":"It is believed that ants evolved from wasps and have lived in the Earth for at least 100 million years. It is said that at any one time there are at least 1 quadrillion living ants on the Earth.Ants are no doubt the most successful of all social insects of Hymenoptera, an order that also includes wasps and bees. Ants are colony makers and their colonies may contain from a few to 20 million individuals. The ant family contains more than 4,500 described species that can be found in tropical or temperate areas of the world.The hallmark of ants is their highly advanced social behaviour. All species of ants are social, while their cousins, some of the bees and many wasps, still lead single lives. Ant societies can have a million or more members, each rigidly programmed to behave in the best interests of its members. They are remarkably adaptive and are found almost anywhere.The colonies are female societies. The queen lays unfertilised or male eggs as needed. The sole job of the drones when they mature is to mate for a few moments with a young queen. When new males and queens emerge from a colony, they usually engage in a nuptial flight, during which fertilisation occurs. The male dies soon after the flight. The female drops to the ground, sheds her wings, and is adopted by an existing colony or buries herself in a cavity, where she founds a new colony.All worker ants are female. So basically the ant world is a mother and daughter universe.An ant colony resembles an extended family. Its members all have a common mother, the queen and often the same father, one of the drones with which the queen mated. And the members of an ant colony are even more closely bonded than a human family. The sisters in an ant colony share an average of 75 percent of their genes as compared to human siblings who share only 50 percent.The colony has one goal: to ensure the reproduction and survival of its common genes. The brood or eggs therefore becomes the nucleus of the colony. All the cooperative actions associated with ants – food gathering, colony defence, brood tending, nest construction – center on rearing the next generation.This demands not only cooperation but also sacrifice. The female worker ants sacrifice their own fertility because it is more efficient to help raise the eggs of a single, continually laying queen than to lay and rear their own eggs. Likewise soldier ants automatically risk their own lives to defend a territory needed to feed their colony’s brood.The colonies also show a division of labour. There are queens, drones, huntresses and brood-tending workers. The queen, who is usually winged, produce a large number of eggs which are fed and cared for by the workers. The other females who are wingless, non-reproductive workers perform the life-maintaining tasks of the colony. In some colonies there are subcastes among worker ants. The division here is correlated with size. Small workers tend the brood or larvae and the larger workers hunt for food. Guard ants at the entrance discriminate nestmates from strangers. They will defend the nest to death if invaded. The drones are produced from unfertilised eggs and serve only to fertilise the queen.The way ants communicate is also very interesting. Without voice or ear, an ant sends perhaps 50 messages through body language and pheromones. Ants are in fact little chemical factories, continuously producing an array of substances called pheromones, that serves as the ant’s language. Through these pheromones the ants can convey messages ranging from the location of food to the presence of danger. They use pheromones to orchestrate social behaviour as diverse as tending the young, grooming the queen, marking their territory, mating and laying trails. They also interact through oral exchange of food called trophallaxis, a behaviour pattern of critical importance to social organisation in ants.An ant’s life cycle includes egg, larva, pupa and adult.Whether an egg will develop into a worker or queen depends mainly on the amount and kind of food fed to the larvae.Ants usually live in nests excavated in the soil or wood or in a variety of natural cavities. Some ants called army ants form temporary nests that consist entirely of the ants themselves, suspended from one another and a supporting object. The nest is a living ball or cylinder of ants. In this cluster the queen and brood are enclosed. After nesting phase, the nomadic phase starts.The whole colony moves with the queen and the brood and are protected by the huge soldiers who will kill everything that come into their way. The African weaver ants make their nest of living leaves held in place by larval silk.Ants are generally omnivorous but some need special food. Fungus growing ants cut leaves and bring them to their nest to fertilise the fungus gardens they built. These ants are herbivorous and survive on fungus. In some species like the Atta or leaf cutter ants, the queen lays special non-fertilised eggs which will be consumed by the ants in the absence of food.The harvester ants frequently visit grass fields to harvest and store the grass seeds. They live in arid environments and survive almost totally on seeds. Specialised workers crack the seeds for the other ants to eat. Some ants like the gatherers or the herders feed on plant juices.Some ants are temporary or permanent parasites in colonies of other ant species. The Amazon ants attack other ants and bring back unconsumed brood to serve as slaves as soon as they’ve matured.","keyword":"[\"colony\", \"queen\", \"worker\", \"brood\", \"drone\", \"nest\"]","ALS":"22.152173913043477"},{"english_id":"642","id":"643","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"The Truth About Bats","article":"Bats are among the world’s least appreciated and most endangered animals, thanks to centuries of myth and superstition. Contrary to common misconceptions, bats are not blind, they are not rodents and they won’t get tangled in your hair. The truth is that bats are mong the most gentle and beneficial animals on earth.A bat is a winged mammal with the ability to fly. It’s ability to maintain sustained flight, unique among mammals, results from the modification of hand-like forelimbs into wings. Bats are mammals just like humans which means all bats are warm blooded, have hair, bear young ones and nurse them.All bats can see but some use special sonar system called echolocation. These bats make high frequency calls either out of their mouths or noses and then listen for echoes to bounce from the objects in front of them. They’re able to form pictures in their brains by listening to the reflected sounds. In this way, bats are able to comfortably move around at night, avoiding predators, locating their food and capturing insects in total darkness.Bats belong to the order Chiroptera and are divided into two suborders: the Megachiroptera (megabats) and the Microchiroptera (microbats). Microbats detect their prey using echolocation while most megabats cannot echolocate but have highly developed eyesight.Starting out as insect eaters, there are now bats that live on fruit, fish, nectar, blood, rodents, frogs, and even other bats. With this great variability in their way of life, bats have become the second largest mammalian order and are now spread over most of globe.Nearly 70% of the 950 species of bats feed mainly on insects. Others eat fruit, nectar, and pollen; a few eat blood, fish, or other mammals. Fruit eaters or frugivorous bats living in tropical climates have very good eyesight and sense of smell for finding ripe fruit to eat. The nectar and pollen feeders are found in desert areas. Carnivorous bats living in India, Southeast Asia, Australia and South America, have sharp claws and teeth for catching small vertebrates like fish, birds, small mammals and reptiles. A few Latin American bats called vampire bats eat only blood.Vampire bats do not actually suck blood. They lap it up like a dog drinking water. They use their sharp, highly modified teeth to make a shallow wound and secrete an anticoagulant in their saliva to inhibit clotting of the blood. The vampire’s bite is painful but not usually dangerous, though the saliva may transmit certain diseases.Bats are nocturnal or active at twilight and hence natural enemies of night flying insects. A single bat can catch 200 mosquito-sized insects in one hour.Unlike other animals, a bat’s body is best adapted for hanging upside down. Bats actually have specialised tendons that cling to their roosts without expending any energy. Hanging upside down also provide bats with roosting space away from predators in safe places in trees and building that few other animals can use.Bats have low rates of reproduction. Most species produce one or two pups in a litter. Some species that hibernate have unusual reproductive cycles. Mating takes place in autumn, and the females store sperm in their reproductive tracts during winter. Ovulation and fertilisation occur in spring. The gestation period for most of these species is about 40-70 days and for some up to 100 days. In the vampire bat the gestation could be as much as 8 months.The new-born bats are large and are nursed from pectoral mammary glands by their mothers. Some young bats first fly at about the age of three weeks, a time when their milk teeth are replaced by permanent teeth.There is no place like home for bats. They spend half their lives in roost, where they rest, mate, tend their young, and hibernate. Bats have always lived in extraordinary places. Trees and caves are their favourite haunts, but they are also found in foliage, crevices in rocks, in spaces under the bark of trees, termite hills and cliffs. Some make tents out of the leaves, some roost in the hollow stems of bamboos. Species that roost in caves and trees often form huge colonies. Over the years bats have found alternative homes in buildings.However human activities are encroaching on bat’s space. Caves have been disturbed by mining and cave exploration activities. Trees are being cut and cleared. The loss of habitat has taken its toll on the nocturnal creatures. World-wide there are now fewer than 1,000 species.Mortality among bats is usually accidental or is associated with human activity. Some temperate species are remarkably long-lived; little brown bats have been recorded as living for 30 years, but 10 years is probably more common in that species.Bats are very beneficial to earth. Tropical bats are key elements in rain forest ecosystems, which rely on them to pollinate flowers and disperse seeds for countless bees and shrubs. Bat droppings in caves support whole ecosystems of unique organisms including bacteria useful in detoxifying wastes, improving detergents and producing antibiotics.Lesser known facts about batsVampire bats adopt orphans and have been known to risk their lives to share food with less fortunate roost-mates.Bumblebee bat is the world’s smallest mammal. It’s found in Thailand and weighs less than a penny.Giant flying foxes found in Indonesia have wingspans of nearly 6 feet. They are called flying foxes because their faces resemble those of little foxes.The tiny woolly bats of West Africa usurp the webs of colonial spidersThe Honduran white bat is pure white in colour and has yellow nose and ears.

But in India it appears that zoos should be the last place for animals of any sort, let alone the endangered variety.It is no secret that most Indian zoos are in a bad state. Although zoos claim to educate people and preserve species, Indian zoos do neither. Most zoo enclosures are quite small, and labels provide little information. Visitors are more interested in entertainment, often at the expense of the animals, than in educating themselves.The purpose of most zoos’ research is to find ways to breed and maintain more animals and to increase their numbers. Most of the animals housed in zoos are not endangered at all, nor are they being prepared for release into natural habitats!! The zoos are full of animals that are commonly seen – such as mongooses, peacocks, wolves and ducks.A group of wild animalsMaybe these animals should be released in the wild. There will be more space in the zoos for endangered animals then.So what purpose are the zoos serving? The entry for most zoos (including Mumbai’s Jijamata Udyan) is around Rs. 10\/-, a mere pittance that is just not sufficient to maintain the area. Why can’t they charge more for a ticket?Research carried out by scientists show that animals are psychologically affected by the lack of space and the constant intrusion of people. The miserable living conditions in zoos and the lack of privacy often lead to animals indulging in abnormal behaviour known as ‘zoochosis’. They bang their heads against the wall, bite cage bars and even bite their own limbs!More than 60% of the animals in zoos have marks on their heads because of continuously banging their heads against the bar, says animal rights activist, Maneka Gandhi. An activist is a person who believes in direct action like mass demonstration, in support of a cause.India has 64 fairly large zoos and another 194 are medium sized zoos- and statistics show that in all these zoos some 10-15 percent animals die every year! Of course the deaths of endangered species gets mentioned in the newspapers, but deaths of monkeys, deer and other less prized animals often goes unnoticed.The other day, for instance, a visit to the Mumbai zoo (Jijamata Udyan in Byculla) came as a rude shock. Most of the animal cages are dismally small; the lioness can cover the length of her cage in three paces. Elephants are cruelly chained close to the main entrance; the hyena had a raw untreated gash on its leg, while the ducks were flapping helplessly in the dry pond. There was not a drop of water to be seen except for some stagnant water in the hippo trough.On top of all this hecklers abound, driving the animals to frenzy with their hoots and jeers. And the worst part is no one seems to care.The Supreme Court has finally woken up to the plight of caged animals and has ordered that no new zoos be built without the Court’s prior approval and anyone who fails to follow the order be severely punished. The Court was forced to intervene after the Central Zoo Authority, (authority set up by the government in 1992, under the Wildlife Protection Act), failed to improve the conditions of zoos.In order to raise much-needed funds and improve zoo conditions, three Andhra Pradesh zoos (The Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad and two other zoos at Vizag and Tirupati) have hit upon a unique adoption scheme. A big cat can be adopted for Rs 1 lakh while a whole lion safari could cost as much as Rs 20 lakhs.And for those of you who cannot afford the total amount, don’t lose heart. There is a scheme by which people can pay a small share of the total cost. The only catch is, you cannot take your pet home. Now if only the other zoos did something similar, at least then the existing caged animals will have a fighting chance.","keyword":"[\"animal\", \"cage\", \"court\", \"endanger\", \"zoos\", \"jijamata\"]","ALS":"31.208333333333332"},{"english_id":"644","id":"645","level":"5","topic":"1","title":"The Vultures are Dying","article":"What’s all this hullabaloo about ‘making connections’?

What can happen to vultures can happen to us.Experts have found traces of pesticides in the brain tissue of vultures and say that this may be the cause of their death. The food chain holds the key. Vultures eat animal carcasses infected with pesticides from the grain that forms the cattle-feed. Other birds or prey, like fishing eagles, also become victims as pesticides enter into the plankton in water, which are then eaten by fish which eagles eat. See, how the poison climbs steadily, a little higher at each level? Until it reaches the vultures. Or us. After all, we eat meat too. Vegetarians needn’t rejoice.Portrait of a VultureA government survey studied 108 samples of cereals, pulses, eggs, milk, meat and vegetables out of which 104 were found to contain pesticides, and 69 samples had pesticide levels above the allowable limit.Vultures also clean up a carcass in two hours flat. No smell, just sparkling dry bones remain. Without the vultures, your next trip to a wildlife sanctuary will be highlighted by SMELL!!Aldrin, DDT, dieldrin, chlordane – these fancy-named killers – have over the years led to the decline of the Californian condor, the American bald eagle, the grey partridge and the song thrush in England, and the South African blue crane. Realising how deadly they are, the U.S. and several European countries have banned the use of these pesticides, but countries like ours haven’t their lesson.What happens when pesticides like these are eaten by birds (if they don’t die first) is really weird. They lay deformed eggs with thin egg shells, and many of the young birds die really soon. Sometimes, because these chemicals jigger up the parents’ endocrine systems, the male baby birds become very feminine.So will this affect humans? Naturally, it will. Scientists in Canada, Sweden and the U.S. have found a very strong link between the use of pesticides and a certain type of cancer called Non Hodgkin’s Lymphomas.And wouldn’t you think that, babies at least would be safe from the clutch of these chemicals? Well, they’ve found pesticides in mother’s milk! Besides, 20 different brands of baby milk powder sold in the market were tested, and 90% of them showed that infants fed on them would absorb 90% more of the toxic chemical beta-HCH than was acceptable.So next time, someone you know starts shaving instead of putting on lipstick, don’t say we didn’t warn you![ Courtesy: Gobar Times, a children’s newspaper produced by the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.

Officials say that the expedition has a harmless aim: it is merely a survey to collect data on the Bryde, Sperm and Minke whales’ habitats, diet and migration patterns.But the environmentalists are up in arms against them. What has shocked them is the Japanese intent to catch and kill 160 whales. Both the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and the International Whaling Commission (IWC) are furious with Japan. They insist that the project is not a research study at all, and is merely a cover for commercial hunting.The Japanese, on the other hand, argue that Bryde and Sperm whale populations have increased over the past few years, and so hunting can resume. They also claim that they want to study the whales’ diet – but in order to look inside their stomachs, they have to kill the whales!A minke whaleJapanese officials says that while the whale meat would be sold in the local markets, the resulting profits would be used for further whale research!It is common knowledge that whale meat is sold for an astronomical price in Japan. So how is Japan’s whaling (commercial hunting of whales) scientific? How can they kill the creatures they are supposed to be ‘protecting’? These are some questions, which must be answered.If the Japanese are indeed carrying out a research expedition (as they claim), then they should find a way to do it without harming their subjects.Whaling (the commercial hunting of whales) has been going on for years now. As the activity increased and the population of whales began dwindling, the whaling nations of the world got together to form an organisation called the ‘International Whaling Commission’, in 1946.A sperm whale familyThe commission set down a number of rules that included a ban on the hunting of certain endangered species, while specifying certain areas for hunting purposes, and safeguarding young whales and mother whales.In 1986, Japan signed an international agreement to give up whaling. However, the country continued to hunt Minke whales, for what they claimed was ‘research’.This recent expedition is the first time Japan has openly declared it is targeting other whale species – including the endangered Sperm whale, the Bryde whale and the Minke whales.The Bryde whale is a grayish-coloured whale that can grow to a length of 46 ft. These whales are most common in coastal areas of most tropical and subtropical countries.The Minke whale is smaller and can be found virtually everywhere – although they are less common in the tropics. Most of the countries have given up whaling, but Norway and Japan argue since Minke whales are fairly abundant, they can be hunted.Both the Minke and the Bryde are not on the endangered list, but they are protected (as per an international agreement signed by whaling nations, in 1986.)Whales are not only the largest but also among the most intelligent of mammals. There are two main groups of whales – Baleen whales and Toothed whales.Both the Bryde and the Minke whales are Baleen whales, which means they are filter feeders. These mammals do not have teeth. Instead, thin plates of baleen (a fingernail-like material) hang from their upper jaws.These plates act as gigantic strainers, trapping the fish and releasing seawater. A Baleen whale swims with its mouth open, in order to engulf plankton and seawater by the tonne. It then shuts its mouth and presses its tongue against the baleen plates. This forces the water out of the mouth and traps the prey.Toothed whales are more numerous and are much smaller than Baleen whales. The Killer whale, found in the polar seas, is a toothed whale and is considered to be the most ferocious of all whales.If water enters a whale’s lungs, it drowns as any other air-breathing creature would. This is because a whale doesn’t have gills. It surfaces at regular intervals to take in air through nostrils that are situated at the top of its head.The largest mammal in the world, today, is the blue whale. This whale belongs to the Baleen category and can grow to a length of up to 100 feet (which would be more than 10 cars lined up bumper to bumper!).The Blue whale is larger than the largest ever brontosaurus fossil found — 75 ft in length. If countries like Japan are allowed to get away with their “research”, these marvelous creatures could soon become the next item on Earth’s “Extinct” list.","keyword":"[\"whale\", \"minke\", \"baleen\", \"bryde\", \"japan\", \"sperm\"]","ALS":"32.5"},{"english_id":"646","id":"647","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"This One is For your Eyes Only","article":"Any mention of the word ‘zari’ may remind you of the heavily embroidered Banaras silk sarees that your mother, sister or aunts may have. Embroidering silk sarees with zari, or golden and silver wrapping on silk threads, is an old and well known art in India.A sari with zari work is a dream come true for most Indian women.But if you mention zari to “eye doctor” or optometrist Dr Mohan Ram, he will probably remember a patient’s retina. For this optometrist from the LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, has pioneered a new, cheap and efficient method of testing the retina. No prizes for guessing what the replacement is – it’s the good old zari! A report on Dr Mohan Ram’s path breaking achievement was published in ‘The Hindu’ newspaper recently.Optometrists spend a large part of their daily routines looking into the eyes of patients. They do so to check whether the retina is working properly. How it is done is interesting: they throw a beam of light on the retina and measure the electrical signals that the retina sends to the brain. It sends the signal through the optic nerve. These signals are called electroretinograms or ERG. They are measured with a special instrument called the DTL electrode.There is nothing wrong with this procedure except for one thing. The DTL electrode costs are on the higher side. One metre of electrode fibre costs about Rs 2,500. This increased Dr L.S. Mohan Ram’s determination to find a cheaper and equally efficient method of measuring ERG.He succeeded, and in a spectacular way. Unlike the traditional zari, which was made of silk thread, the modern zari is made of nylon threads that are covered with some metallic wrapping such as gold, silver or copper. Thin and flexible, it is a good conductor of heat and electricity. It can also be easily sterilized.Dr Mohan Ram decided to check out the efficiency of zari on 14 normal sighted people. He measured the ERG of one eye with zari and the other eye with DTL. And the patterns of ERG obtained with zari compared favourably with the DTL patterns. Zari had another great advantage: it cost Rs 50 a metre and was easily available locally.The young optometrist has received a number of honours for his path-breaking achievement. At a meeting in Sydney, Australia, recently, the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV), spoke of Dr Mohan Ram’s innovation.Meanwhile, the optometrist is busy at work. He is working with research laboratories to introduce a particular standard in zari, so that it can be used without any problems.","keyword":"[\"zari\", \"mohan\", \"retina\", \"optometrist\", \"silk\", \"thread\"]","ALS":"22.318181818181817"},{"english_id":"647","id":"648","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"Treaty on Global Warming","article":"In the last week of July 2001, representatives from 178 countries met in Bonn, Germany, for something that is very crucial to their future and the very survival of our planet. They signed a historic agreement that promises to fight global warming. This is the first international treaty of its kind that seeks to check the excesses of human development at the cost of the environment – and the planet itself.Location and date marker for glacier in Jasper National Park in Canada. Clear evidence of global warming.The very fact that the treaty has been signed despite strong opposition by the United States, the world’s greatest polluter, represents a triumph of will. The feeling that it is now or never is what gave the decisive push toward the signing of the treaty.Global Warming: An artistic rendition of of a rapidly warming earthWhat is global warming?Global warming is exactly that: the warming up of the globe, that is of planet earth. This happens as the level of greenhouse gases like carbon-dioxide keeps increasing within the earth’s atmosphere instead of being released. Such gases are released into the atmosphere when coal and other fuels are burned to provide energy.Greenhouse gases are thus called as they act like the glass walls and ceilings of a greenhouse. So, while the sunlight warms up things, it doesn’t let the heat escape. Many scientists say that the earth’s rising temperatures could eventually melt polar ice caps and cause sea levels to rise, thus worsening the flood situation across the world.In 1997, a treaty regarding greenhouse emissions was developed in Kyoto, Japan. That treaty had limited the amount of harmful gases that countries could release into the atmosphere. But the main hindrance to the signing of the Kyoto Protocol was the opposition of the United States. Although the US represents only 4 per cent of the world’s population, it produces as much as about 25 per cent of the greenhouse gases.Like in 1997, this year too the United States refused to sign the agreement at Bonn. But the treaty was signed anyway. Michael Zammit Cutajar, the top United Nations (UN) official dealing with climate change expressed his jubilation, saying, “We made a tremendous political advance.” The next UN climate conference is scheduled to be held in Morocco in October.","keyword":"[\"treaty\", \"greenhouse\", \"global\", \"warming\", \"signing\", \"warm\"]","ALS":"30.642857142857142"},{"english_id":"649","id":"650","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"Venice is Sinking","article":"Most people all over the world travel by the road. In a city in Italy however, waterways make up the primary commuting routes. The city of Venice, rich in architectural marvels, is best known for its canals. Unfortunately, this beautiful city of flat-bottomed boats (Gondolas), churches and quaint cobbled streets is sinking and sinking fast.Venice is SinkingKnown as the ‘Queen of the Adriatic’, Venice is situated on 120 islands formed by canals in the lagoon between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers, at the northern extremity of the Adriatic Sea. And even the bits of firm ground have rather boggy foundations and all this is slowly getting eroded.Why is Venice sinking?The existing ground water table and the global climate changes that have raised sea levels by several inches, are proving disastrous for the city. As sea-ice melts and water levels rise, floods in Venice are getting from bad to worse. And buildings are already feeling the impact of this phenomenon, with their foundations literally being shaken. Take for example one of the most famous landmarks of Venice, the 900-year-old St. Mark’s Basilica, a famous cathedral that now leans slightly to the left because of its unstable foundation.Venice is SinkingExperts warn that the city may sink an additional eight inches in the next 50 years. Many scared residents have already started to move to drier regions in Italy’s mainland. To tackle the flood menace, a group of Venetians, called the New Venice Consortium, has come up with ‘Project Moses’ – a dam project named after the biblical figure, Moses. The idea is to place underwater gates at different points where the Adriatic Sea water enters the lagoon. When the water is low, the gates will remain open and as the water rises, the gates will close, preventing the seawater from flooding Venice. However, there’s a hitch to implementing this idea. Environmentalists point out that the gates would have to remain closed most of the time and seawater will not be able to move in and out of Venice. As a result, the lagoon water will become stagnant, harming the fish and plants that live there. Until a viable solution is found out, Venice, it seems, would continue to be plagued by floods.

A few tremors and some buildings that collapse does not mean that the shape of the earth has changed, does it? However, earthquakes can and do change the topography of the region.An earthquake raised Rhodes island. The line of erosion (on the rock to the left) shows the sea level before the earthquake. The rise is uneven in different parts of the island, usually several meters. [Ввласенко \/ CC BY-SA]Ввласенко \/ CC BY-SA (https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/3.0)Our earth is made of many layers just like an onion. We can divide it into four main layers: the inner or solid core, the outer or liquid core, mantle, and crust. The inner core is composed mostly of iron and is extremely hot. This heat causes the outer core to remain in a liquid or molten form.Most of the earth’s mass is in the mantle. But if pressure were to be applied on this layer, it deforms slowly. The crust is the thinnest layer and is rocky. It is also the coldest layer relatively. Because it is cold, the layer is also brittle and fractures easily during an earthquake.The crust is formed of huge rocky plates that are constantly moving at a speed of 10 centimetres per year. These are known as plate tectonics and they carry the continents or the ocean floor or sometimes both.While small quakes occur at depths of less than 80 kilometres from the earth’s surface, other major earthquakes occur at plate boundaries where the earth’s crust is being subducted (when a plate rides over another plate) into the earth’s mantle. These occur as deep as 750 kilometres below the surface.Most earthquakes take place along the boundary between the plates. Heat currents propel the plates and this movement causes the plates to grind and collide against each other.Since this is not a smooth process but is accompanied by friction and heat, tearing and shearing, the strain releases energy causing a fracture against the weak portions of the crust. This energy travels in waves along the surface of the earth causing what we term an earthquake.The earths’ crust below the ocean is quite fragile. The heat currents that propel the plates are also thought to suck down sections of the undersea crust. This produces huge trenches on oceans thousands of feet deep. The Mariana’s Trench in the Pacific Ocean is a result of undersea tremors.When the currents die away, the material forming the bottom of the trench rises, as it is lighter and sometimes unexpectedly forms mountain ranges or new islands to surface.An undersea earthquake can also cause flash floods or trigger a tsunami. A tsunami is an enormous sea wave measuring over 80 feet that travels at speeds of 500 kilometres per hour. If it does crash on land, it can cause devastating damage.A mosque is left standing amid the rubble in Banda Aceh, post 2004 tsunami. Several mosques survived and may have been saved by the open ground floor that is part of their design. The tsunami waves reached the middle of the second floor.On land surface too, earthquakes can change the terrain unexpectedly. The Himalayan mountain range was formed as a direct result of two continental plates colliding against each other. The great Tokyo earthquake in 1923, caused by the twisting of a section in Sagami Bay, lifted the Bay about three metres while shifting the Izu peninsula four metres to the west!The aftermath of an earthquake can result in large fissures on the grounds, creating gorges and valleys where none existed before. Earthquake vibrations can cause sandy soils to liquefy. Such a process would make the ground sink suddenly, in a process called fluidising.In a mountainous terrain, landslides may occur and sometimes, small hills disappear or are levelled to the ground.A major earthquake is also followed by smaller tremors like an echo. These are called aftershocks. Aftershocks are smaller tremors that occur in the same fault area where the original quake took place. As a general rule, aftershocks represent minor readjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped up at the time of the main shock.It is often asked if an earthquake in Toronto or Greece can trigger an earthquake in India. The answer is no, when you consider the distances involved. The earth’s rocky crust is not rigid enough to transfer such stress efficiently over thousands of miles.","keyword":"[\"earthquake\", \"crust\", \"plate\", \"tsunami\", \"core\", \"tremor\"]","ALS":"24.848484848484848"},{"english_id":"652","id":"653","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"What Is The Origin Of Silk Fabric?","article":"My mother took out her favourite blue silk saree for the dinner party. I looked at it, mesmerised by its shimmer and lustre. The rich fabric draped around her body, making her look so very elegant. Definitely no other fabric can match the qualities of silk.But have you ever wondered, how silk fabric came into existence? Silk production, or ‘Sericulture’ as it is known, has a long history, unknown to most of us.What Is The Origin Of Silk Fabric?The silken rootsThe history of silk is shrouded in mystery. Some historians say that silk originated in China about 10,000 years ago. In China, however, legend has it that Empress Si Ling Chi of China was the first one to discover silk more than five thousand years ago. The story goes that while sitting under a mulberry tree in her palace garden, the Empress was having tea. A cocoon fell into her hot cup of tea from the branches of the mulberry tree. And as she watched, a strong white thread unraveled itself.That accidental process of unravelling the silkworm’s cocoon hasn’t changed much in the last thousands of years. Cocoons are still dipped in hot water to loosen the tightly woven filaments that make up a silkworm’s cocoon. These filaments, or fine threads, are unwound onto a spool. Each cocoon is made up of a filament between 600 and 900 meters long! Imagine that! You could take just one tiny cocoon and when you unravel its filament, you could wind it around your house more than eight times. Of course, these filaments are very very thin. Between five and eight of these super-fine filaments are twisted together to make one silk thread.By the 14th century BC, the production of silk gradually developed into an industry in China. In fact it became one of the principal elements of the Chinese economy. Silk was being used for musical instruments, fishing-lines, bowstrings, and even rag paper, the world’s first luxury paper.For more than two thousand years, the Chinese kept the secret of silk to themselves. It was one of the most zealously guarded secrets in history. Anyone found guilty of smuggling silkworm eggs, cocoons, or mulberry seeds was put to death. Silk became the cloth of emperors and royalty and a great source of wealth. Within the palace, the emperor used to adorn a robe of white silk while outside, he, his principal wife, and the heir to the throne wore yellow, the color of the earth.Common people were prohibited from wearing silk. Even the merchants trading silk were allowed to wear the exclusive fabric. Silk was stocked in warehouses for an emergency.The Chinese used silk in many ways. Civil servants were paid in quantities of silk, and it was a way for the rulers to reward their subjects. Silk was also used as currency in domestic as well as foreign trade. After all, barter trade was the most common way of trading. So Chinese traders exchanged their silk in return for spices and jewels bought in India.Gradually, people from different sections of society began wearing tunics of silk, and silk came into more general use.Letting the secret out of the silky bagIn 200 BC, that’s about 2200 years ago, a large number of people migrated from China and settled in Korea. They carried with them the secret of silk production. From then on, the secret of silk slowly travelled throughout Asia. It took about five hundred years for the knowledge of silk production to reach India. But once it did, India soon started trading silk with the Persians. However, in less than a hundred years, the Persians, too, had mastered the art of silk weaving, and started developing their own rich patterns and techniques.It was only as late as the 13th century AD, that Italy began silk production, with the introduction of 2000 skilled silk weavers from Persia. That’s only about 700 years ago, which isn’t very long considering that silk came to India one thousand years before that.Eventually, silk production became widespread in Europe, but the widespread production of silk hasn’t dented China’s image as the Silk Giant. Even today, five thousand years after the first cocoon fell into the Empress’ teacup, China is still the world’s largest producer of silk.","keyword":"[\"silk\", \"cocoon\", \"filament\", \"production\", \"fabric\", \"china\"]","ALS":"22.666666666666668"},{"english_id":"656","id":"657","level":"5","topic":"11","title":"What Toothpaste did the Ancients Use?","article":"One of my earliest childhood memories of Delhi is seeing morning walkers, milkmen, or shopkeepers chewing away at the neem stick, much like a cow chewing the cud. It seemed strange that they should go to all that effort when readymade toothpaste was available.Neem (Azadirachta indic a) twig still used as toothbrush in many parts of IndiaThe world was divided into four kinds of people: those who used toothpaste and brush, and they were the elite; those who used tooth powder for which the index finger doubled as the brush; people who used indigenous “monkey-brand” tooth powders and lastly, those who used neem sticks which were two-in-one.The last seemed the least sophisticated, even if it was the most effective, for Indians have been chewing on the neem stick for a couple of thousand years.Almost 5000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians had devised their formula for cleaning the teeth. It consisted of a mixture of powdered ashes of oxen hooves, pumice and a powdery mix of burnt eggshells. They probably used their fingers as toothbrushes.Around 2,500 years ago, it was the turn of the Chinese to talk about dental care, for tooth decay was as much a reality then as it is now and perhaps it was as necessary to smile and look good then as it is now.Persian manuscripts about a 1000 years ago, revealed a healthy level of awareness about the need to keep away from rough toothpowders. Some of the ingredients included animal parts dried and ground, herbs and minerals. These kept getting altered.For instance, about a couple of centuries ago, in England, chemists made very rough powders often using material harmful to the teeth such as earthenware and china. To make it taste good they mixed it with glycerine. For the foaming effect, they used borax powder.As recently as 140 years ago, little glass pots made an appearance in Britain in which the paste was packaged. It had a more solid look than the powdery mixtures of before.And one of the popular brands had a reference to the areca nut, popular in India! Flavouring was the name of the game, then and now, though now it is mint that rules the roost.In the 19th century, the toothpaste in a tube made its appearance as we know it today. And no prizes for guessing who manufactured it – you guessed it! The American company Colgate, was one of the first to squeeze dental creams out of the tube. Till 60 years ago, soap was an important ingredient of the paste, later replaced by other emulsifying agents.And of course everyone knows about the addition of fluoride to toothpaste that protects the tooth enamel against decay!But when did the toothbrush first appear on the scene? As is the case with so many ingenious ideas and inventions, the Chinese probably invented the toothbrush in its modern-day form about 500 years ago, by fixing animal bristles on a handle.Almost 200 years later, the toothbrush showed its bristles in Paris and a little while later, in England as well. The first ancestor of the nylon toothbrush, the one we use twice a day today, made its appearance in 1938, brought out by the American company Du Pont.And now? Choosing between a red, blue or striped toothpaste and a matching toothbrush seems to have become one of the most difficult decisions of our lives – fluoride or no fluoride.","keyword":"[\"toothbrush\", \"toothpaste\", \"tooth\", \"neem\", \"fluoride\", \"powder\"]","ALS":"38.9375"},{"english_id":"659","id":"660","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"What are Go-Go Boots?","article":"Ever seen rock stars or movie stars strutting about in calf-length boots? Well, these calf-length boots were the rage at one point of time. Discotheques at Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York saw young women dressed in thigh high skirts to show off these boots called Go-Go boots.The Go-Go boots had its origin with the original ankle-length boots with pointed toes and inch-high heels worn by Cowboys in the American mid-West.Cowboys needed these boots for riding, and to ensure they don’t bitten by scorpions or snakes when they were walking on the desert undergrowth. The heels also gave them a grip from being dragged along when they lassoed a cow or calf for branding (leaving a mark of the owner on the skin of the cattle) or during cattle drives.By the late 1940s and 1950s, the boots became a rage with city-bred youngsters to give a macho “tough guy” image. At the height of teenage fashion people could be seen dressed in T-shirts with cigarettes packs rolled into sleeves, leather jackets and steel-tipped soles on their boots.Steel clips or horseshoes were fastened with copper rivets on the soles of these shoes to cause a tapping effect when they walked. These tap shoes were usually black and the swagger and metal tap on school halls added to the tough guy image.Shelf full of cowboy bootsThis style faded out by the mid-1960s at the height of the flower-power hippy culture. Ankle-length boots rose to calf-high and later knee high boots when Go-Go boots became a fashion statement.Go-Go boots were first introduced in the 1960s by French fashion designer Andre Coureges. That year, his collection featured all-white attire that included dresses that ended three inches above the knee and white mid-calf boots, called “kid boots”. When people started attending discos wearing it and dancing the night away it became the “Go-Go” boots.In 1965, Nancy Sinatra wore those boots and recorded a song These Boots Are Made for Walking that became a smash hit topping the US and Billboard charts. The record sold 4 million copies and the boots made history. And Nancy Sinatra became the poster icon for the Go-Go boots.However, two years later Go-Go boots too fell out of fashion though they were occasionally worn by rock stars and stage performers.During the same period platform shoes were introduced as they were nearly as high as a platform or sidewalk of the road. Also referred to as “the Elevated Orthopedic Nightmare,” these shoes had broad heels and broad toes uniformly two or three inches high. Walking on this required great dexterity and at its peak there were many casualties to this fashionable boots.However, these shoes found a ready buyer among people conscious of their short stature. Orthopaedics (doctors who specialize in bone treatment) began to have a field day with hundreds of people being wheeled in every day with twisted or broken ankles after tripping off these high shoes.Thankfully the platform nightmare disappeared for some decades but made a fresh comeback in the 1990s. Singers like Elton John and rock groups, and other fashion leaders, introduced this fashion once again.Over the decade, platform boots gave way to platform sandals. Today, it is very fashionable to wear platform-high slip-ons or sandals and totter about, all the while praying that you will not trip and twist or break your ankle.","keyword":"[\"boot\", \"fashion\", \"platform\", \"shoe\", \"wear\", \"heel\"]","ALS":"37.625"},{"english_id":"660","id":"661","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"What are Komodo Dragons?","article":"European mythology abounds in stories of knights in shining armour battling fearsome dragons. Fairytale storybooks are peppered with illustrations of these huge monsters looking like crocodiles with wings and huge claws and breathing fire. Of course fire breathing dragons do not exist, but there is a tiny island, called Komodo, in Indonesia, that is home to dragons – yes, real dragons!Unlike the dragons of yore, the Komodo dragon does not possess a fiery breath, nor can it trample hapless humans underfoot, but it does pack a mean bite. This ‘dragon’ has a forked tongue that constantly flicks in and out (just like that of a snake). And just like a snake, when provoked the Komodo dragon does administer a lethal bite.The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres (10 ft) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms (150 lb).The Komodo’s mouth contains toxic bacteria that fester on wounds. So once the lizard bites, the bacteria (from the lizard’s mouth) do not let the wound heal; and the victim dies within a few days. In addition to its deadly bite, a Komodo also has extremely stubby and powerful legs and its tail can deliver a crushing blow to an opponent.The Komodo dragon is known as the Ora in Indonesia. Oras are good swimmers and the Indonesians also call them water crocodiles as they are excellent swimmers! More than 10,000 years ago, oras were also found in Australia. These Australian dragons (known as Megalania) were far larger than the present day Komodo dragon! In fact a megalania was twice as long as a Komodo dragon and at least five times heavier.Komodo dragons are also found in fewer numbers on two other Indonesian islands – Flores and Rinca. This unusual animal was discovered during the First World War (1914 -1918) when a plane crashed in the Indonesian waters. The pilot survived and swam to a nearby island. Much to his horror, he discovered that giant monsters inhabited the island. Luckily, he was able to radio home and was eventually rescued. When he first told his stories of the ‘giant lizards’ people scoffed at him.Komodo dragons may be very different from the dragons in fairytales, but they do enjoy the distinction of being the world’s largest lizards. They belong to the family of the oldest living lizards, known as monitors and are closely related to an ancient 33 feet long reptile, called the mosasaur that lived about 100 million years ago. While Komodo dragons are nowhere as large as their forefathers, they are known to weigh over 130 kilograms and grow up to 10 feet in length.Adult Komodo prey on goats, deer, young buffaloes, horses – and sometimes, even humans. This huge lizard is capable of gobbling prey up to 15 times its size and can eat as much as 80 percent of its weight in a single meal. A really hungry Komodo dragon has the ability to shift its jaws to swallow food larger than its head.

Newly hatched baby Komodo dragons immediately scurry off to sheltering trees and they spend the initial part of their lives trying to avoid predatory adults!Did you know that the smallest lizard in the world is the Sphaerodactylus parthenopion, measuring 0.70 inches and found only in Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands!","keyword":"[\"dragon\", \"komodo\", \"lizard\", \"indonesian\", \"island\", \"fairytale\"]","ALS":"30.565217391304348"},{"english_id":"664","id":"665","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"What are the Various Jazz Styles?","article":"Jazz originated from the American South in the 18th century as a form of music sung by African slaves employed in the many plantations. Jazz music was influenced by different cultures from a combination of African folk music and rhythms to Caribbean and black American music.Various styles of playing evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries as musicians started to improvise. This was because early musicians did not have formal training in Western classical music and those that did began to introduce European harmonies and forms into Jazz and made the pattern of music uneven.Since, the most important element of jazz is improvisation (the ability to create new music spontaneously). Performers improvised by unexpectedly accenting at various places and dipping down where accents are stressed. This added just the right amount of excitement to make each show unique.In early 20th century, a band from Austin High School, Chicago, developed a unique type of musical arrangement that soon came to be known as ‘Chicago style’ jazz.Chicago musicians included trumpeters Jimmy McPartland and Muggsy Spanier; cornetist Bix Beiderbecke; clarinetists Frank Teschemacher, Pee Wee Russell, Benny Goodman; saxophonists Frankie Trumbauer and Bud Freeman; drummers Dave Tough, George Wettling, and Gene Krupa; and guitarist Eddie Condon.In New York City, James P. Johnson popularised a new musical style from Ragtime called stride piano in which the left hand plays alternating single notes and chords that move up and down the scale while the right hand plays solo melodies or accompanying rhythms. Many jazz pianists were greatly influenced by Johnson including Count Bassie, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller among others.Jazz was not only instrumental but had its vocalists too. Among the greatest jazz singers are Mildred Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Nat ‘King’ Cole (also a superb pianist). However, the various styles evolved mainly due to various bands that introduced different music in different decades.What are the Various Jazz Styles?The big band eraTill the 1920s, Jazz music was performed by solo players until 1923 when Fletcher Henderson organized a jazz band and classified them according to instruments like brass, reed, and percussion. Henderson went on to organise many such bands in the next two decades that included jazz hall of famers like Louis Armstrong, Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins.Louis Armstrong was the first male jazz singer who became popular and he also introduced a kind of singing called ‘scat’ that consisted of wordless syllables sung in the manner of an instrument playing. Armstrong’s recording between 1925 to 1928 rank among the masterpieces of jazz as does his duet performances with pianist Earl “Fatha” Hines.The swing eraBy mid 1930’s, Jazz moved to ‘swing’ and boogie woogie. The swing form was popularised by Duke Ellington. His recording of “It Don’t Mean a Thing If It Ain’t Got That Swing” got nearly everyone swinging to the rhythm of his music. While Swing emphasized four beats to the bar, boogie-woogie stressed on eight beats to the bar.In 1934, Benny Goodman popularised Swing through performances and radio recordings with his band and combos (combination of instruments). Benny soon became the ‘King of Swing’ and he was the first white bandleader to feature both black and white musicians together in public performances.Goodman is credited with other firsts in Jazz. He removed racial segregation and brought black musicians to the fore and in 1938 he and his band performed at Carnegie Hall in New York city, the first time Jazz had been played at a concert hall.Major bands of the swing era included those led by Benny Carter, Bob Crosby, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Earl Hines, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, among others. Boogie-woogie had Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, Meade Lux Lewis, and Pinetop Smith popularising its style.Count Basie immortalised Swing with his own distinctive jazz style adapted from blues that consisted of repeated simple melodies depending less on written arrangements thereby giving more room for rhythmic improvisations.BebopIn the 1940s performers experimented with chord patterns and melodies that came to be called hard Bop or Bebop or funky jazz. Subtle changes of harmony was displayed that required exceptional skill. Bebop took on elements from gospel and blues music blending it with rhythmic drive.Among the well-known Bebop bands was the Jazz Messengers led by drummer Art Blakey; Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, pianist Thelonious Monk, alto sax player Charlie Parker and drummer Max Roach.Bebop musicians played an intricate melody, followed with long periods of solo improvisation. In 1948, tenor saxophonist Stan Getz recorded a slow, romantic solo of Ralph Burns’ composition ‘Early Autumn’ with the Woody Herman band that influenced musicians like Miles Davis and Lee Konitz.Miles Davis’ recordings of these slow rendition numbers was soon christened as a new and better jazz form: that gave birth to the style and word ‘Cool’ to describe something exceptionally groovy.","keyword":"[\"jazz\", \"music\", \"band\", \"swing\", \"musician\", \"benny\"]","ALS":"47.10526315789474"},{"english_id":"665","id":"666","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"What does SOS mean?","article":"Recently, sailors on the nuclear submarine that sank in the Baltic Sea were isolated from rescue workers as their radio set got damaged. Luckily their radio operators knew the Morse code and were able to communicate by knocking on the sides of the ship.There are many explanations for what the words stand for: Save Our Souls; Save Our Ship; Send Our Succour… The meaning of all three is the same – it is a plea for help by someone in distress. That’s exactly what SOS is.It is a coded signal for help that continues to be used by ships, planes and stranded people around the world even 162 years after it was invented by the American Samuel Morse, who invented the first successful telegraph instrument in 1837. The Morse code, as it came to be called, is used to send messages through a telegraph line or the wireless.SOS is the easiest code to transmit and recognise. The code consists of three dots, three dashes and three dots . . . – – – . . . One can tap it on the telegraph or signal with a torch or even with a flag.Before the invention of the code, long distance communication consisted of lamp signals from hilltops, smoke signals and shouted messages. In 1787, M Lammond, a Frenchman invented the first telegraph line that could send messages over a distance by means of electricity. Morse developed the first successful telegraph instrument in 1837.Called a transmitter, the telegraph instrument converts a message into electrical signals. In 1838, Morse also developed a code that consisted of dots and dashes representing alphabets and numbers. These codes were easier to send over the telegraphic line. The dots and dashes travel across the wire and are picked up by a receiving set.The electric signals move a metal point to print these dots and dashes on a paper tape. The code can be used to read these dots and dashes and translate the message.In 1843, the United States Congress approved the first telegraph line from Baltimore in Maryland to Washington DC. In 1844, Morse sent the first message “What has God wrought” on this line using this code.Because of its simplicity the Morse Code continues to be used even as mobile wireless telephones are replacing telegraph transmission.","keyword":"[\"morse\", \"telegraph\", \"code\", \"dash\", \"message\", \"signal\"]","ALS":"23"},{"english_id":"668","id":"669","level":"5","topic":"13","title":"What is Asthma?","article":"Asthma is one of the most common diseases affecting the lungs. A serious disease, it affects all races and both sexes equally. This disease affects millions. Many of us recognize asthma symptoms like wheezing, chest tightness and gasping for breath. However, few of us know what is going on inside the body of a person with asthma.When we breathe, we inhale oxygen through the nose and mouth. The air passes down the trachea or windpipe through the two bronchi that branch off into the millions of tiny airways that make up the lungs. Here the inhaled oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is pulled out of the blood and sent back up the airway to be exhaled.The airways are surrounded by muscles, which are normally relaxed to help air flow. However, in a person with asthma, these airways are constricted. Since these airways are small and tight, they are perpetually inflamed becoming red, swollen and irritated.The body’s airways are highly sensitive to various factors. An asthma attack can be triggered by an allergic response to irritants or allergens like tobacco smoke, cold, pollen, cockroaches, horses, dust, feathers, or even by exercise, cold air and, sometimes, stress.When the airways encounter these factors, they trigger a response in the body. The muscles surrounding the airways constrict, producing a tight feeling in the chest. At the same time, the bronchii produce thick mucus called phlegm, which further clogs the airways.As air gets trapped in the constricted airways, the person is unable to fully inhale or exhale. The person wheezes and gasps for breath. During a mild attack, coughing or a slight tightness may be the only symptom. In a more severe attack, the person’s lips and nails might turn gray or blue due to a lack of oxygen.Asthma that is not well controlled can cause many problems. People miss work or school, go to the hospital, or even die because of their asthma. Asthma attacks usually last from half an hour to several hours. Prolonged or frequent attacks of asthma may prove harmful if the patient is weak or suffers from malnutrition. Some 35-40 percent of childhood asthma cases improve at puberty.A doctor identifies asthma by conducting skin tests for various allergies. Based on these tests, doctors prescribe drugs such as epinephrine or ephedrine in the initial stages. Serious asthma cases, however, may need to take corticosteroids. Sometimes oxygen may also become essential for such a patient.Most asthmatics use an inhaler or a bronchodilator that contains a medicine. These drugs mimic the effect of adrenaline on the airways and open them up. For those who prefer Ayurvedic medicine, there is cromolyn, which has little or no side effects. It is derived from the herb ammivisnaga. Homeopathy too approaches the treatment of asthma holistically, and many patients of asthma have found long-term relief through this method of treatment.Whatever method of treatment or relief one may opt for, asthma can be controlled but, as of now, this disease cannot be completely cured.","keyword":"[\"asthma\", \"airway\", \"attack\", \"person\", \"disease\", \"gasp\"]","ALS":"21.76923076923077"},{"english_id":"669","id":"670","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"What is Blood Pressure?","article":"The heart is a live pump that delivers blood to different parts of the body. Blood flows in or flows out when the heart contracts and expands. The blood is forced into the arteries, which expand to receive the oncoming blood. The force with which the blood moves through the arteries is knows as blood pressure.The arteries have a muscular lining which resists this pressure. The blood is thus squeezed out into smaller blood vessels. Maximum blood pressure coincides with the steady contraction of the heart, which pushes the blood into the arteries. This maximum pressure is called systolic pressure.Between heartbeats the heart expands to take on incoming blood from the lungs. At this point the pressure is minimum and this is called diastolic pressure. The amount of pressure depends upon the strength of the heart muscle, the amount of blood in the circulatory system and the condition of the arteries.To measure the blood pressure, a doctor or nurse uses an instrument in which a column of mercury rises or falls under the pressure. An inflatable pad is wrapped around the arm and air is pumped in using a rubber squeeze bulb. When the mercury rises to a level of 150 to 200 millimetres the pressure applied by the pad stops the blood flow into the lower arm. The air is released slowly.As the pressure is released, a stethoscope is kept on the artery to hear the pulse beat. When the pressure of the pad decreases to the same level as arterial pressure, the flow of blood starts. This flow of pulsing blood can be heard through the stethoscope. When the sound is heard through the stethoscope, pressure is at its maximum or systolic pressure.The device used to measure blood pressure is called sphygmomanometer or blood pressure meter.The sounds heard through the stethescope are called korotkoff sounds. When air is further deflated more blood flows through and the sound is magnified greatly. As the pressure inside the artery lessens so does the sound. The reading at which the sound stops entirely is the diastolic or minimum pressure.The average systolic pressure in a young man is about 120 mm of mercury and the diastolic pressure 80. These figures are usually stated as 120\/80 or 120 over 80. Blood pressure rises with age as the arteries become more rigid. Sometimes stress, exercise or certain diseases may also cause the pressure to rise.Low blood pressure also occurs either due to heart attacks or loss of blood after an injury, etc. When the pressure becomes too low, the supply of oxygen to the brain reduces. Whenever a person has high or low blood pressure, she or he should consult a doctor immediately.","keyword":"[\"blood\", \"pressure\", \"artery\", \"heart\", \"systolic\", \"diastolic\"]","ALS":"20.956521739130434"},{"english_id":"673","id":"674","level":"5","topic":"9","title":"What is Daylight Saving Time?","article":"People in some parts of the world gain an extra hour in winters and are able to sleep and snore that much longer thanks to a suggestion by Benjamin Franklin about daylight saving time. But when the suggestion was first made, it raised such a furore not only from those kept awake by the extra snoring but also from others and they wasted a lot of time fighting over this extra hour.Actually the confusion began when the postal service and the railways began to connect far-flung cities. These towns followed their town clock by measuring the position of the sun. Therefore every city was on a slightly different time.In 1784, Benjamin Franklin, who was US ambassador to France then, suggested the daylight saving time concept but he was ignored. However, the railways decided to standardise time and Britain was the first to adapt a single consistent time across the country. But, this did nothing to ease international travel.In 1884, a Canadian railway engineer Sir Sanford Fleming suggested that the entire world be divided into time zones that would be calculated from a prime meridian. This would help calculate various time zones relative to that one.In October 1884, the International Meridian Conference met in Washington, DC and chose Greenwich, a village just outside London in England as the prime meridian. Though this Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT) was approved and adopted by the world, the various time zones across the world caused longer daylight hours in summer and shorter daylight hours in winter in certain countries.What is daylight saving time?So in 1907, a Londoner called William Willett tried to revive the subject of daylight savings time. Unfortunately he got laughed at. It was the practical Germans who realized that such a scheme helped reduce energy costs in lighting and electricity and immediately implemented it.But why would you want to save daylight time at all? Adopting the Daylight Saving Time (DST) scheme saves energy. Energy used and the demand for electricity for lighting our homes is directly connected to when we go to bed and when we get up.Studies show that sunrise in the summer is very early and most people wake up after the sun rises. Because the sun is up, we don’t need to turn on lights in our homes. Thus, we actually use less energy in the morning. The opposite works in winter.With DST, the ‘spring forward and fall (autumn) backward’ system comes into play. In summer, the clock is extended by an hour and the sun therefore ‘sets’ one hour later. This means that less electricity would be used for lighting and appliances later in the day. In autumn and winters, the clock is set an hour backward as more light is needed in the morning.However, there was opposition as people did not like the idea of getting up an hour early or going to bed an hour later, just to keep up with the Joneses in some far off village in Greenwich.Others complained of the inconvenience of changing all the clocks, and adjusting to a new sleeping schedule. For most people, this is a mere nuisance, but for some people with sleep disorders this transition is very difficult.But in 1916, a year after Willett died, Britain and USA adapted DST. Other countries followed suit. The motivation was to conserve coal during World War I. Clocks were put one hour ahead of GMT during the summer months. But in 1918 the law was repealed in the United States.Two decades later during World War II, DST was re-introduced to help the war effort and clocks were put two hours ahead of GMT during summer! This became known as Double Summer Time.From 1945 to 1962, DST became quite inconsistent with a hodgepodge of time observances and no agreement when to change clocks. Countries were free to observe or not observe DST. This caused confusion no end – especially for the broadcasting industry, for the postal service, railways and airlines.In 1966, the United States Congress introduced the Uniform Time Act to regulate DST across the country. Today, approximately 70 countries utilize DST. While Europe has been taking advantage of the time change for decades, in 1996 the European Union (or EU) standardized a EU-wide ‘summertime period’. The EU is the union of all European countries into one economic entity, though they differ politically.However, some countries like those in the equatorial and tropical regions do not observer DST as daylight hours are similar through the year and there is no advantage in moving clocks backward and forwards.","keyword":"[\"daylight\", \"clock\", \"hour\", \"meridian\", \"save\", \"summer\"]","ALS":"29.75"},{"english_id":"674","id":"675","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"What is Esperanto?","article":"Esperanto is an artificial international language created by Dr Ludovic Lazarus Zamenof between 1877-85.

We kids were very happy without realising and neither did we bother to find out the reason for her absence.It was only later that our principal informed us that Mrs. Khurana’s only son was suffering from leukaemia (wrongly called blood cancer). I remember later that Mrs. Khurana took her son to abroad where he underwent a bone marrow transplant.All this happened years ago, when cancer was “the most dreaded disease”. I was under the impression that in this day and age most any disease was curable except of course for AIDS and that too doctors are working round the clock to find a cure.However, I found out that this disease could strike anyone anytime. Most people think that leukaemia is a form of cancer of the blood. This is not strictly true. Leukaemia is really a cancer of the bone marrow.The bone marrow is found in the cavities of the long bones, ribcage and pelvis and contains many different types of cells, which actually produce all the various types of blood cells. Blood, which nourishes our body is essential to life. There are many different substances like red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, etc in the blood, each with a job to do. There needs to be a certain number of cells of each in our blood.The bone marrow is the body’s blood making factory producing millions of red and white blood cells each and every day of our lives. If one of these bone marrow cells becomes cancerous, it gets out of control. These cells then push out all the normal blood making cells from the bone marrow. Consequently normal blood production stops and the bone marrow and blood begin to fill up with cancerous cells.Various bone marrow cells give rise to various types of blood cells and depending on which marrow cell goes out of control, a particular type of leukaemia affects the person.Electron Microscopy Photography of a group of human Neutrophils. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disorder of the process that normally produces neutrophils, a type of white blood cellBroadly speaking there are two main categories of leukaemia – acute and chronic. Acute leukaemia starts suddenly and progresses rapidly, sometimes even killing the patient in a matter of weeks if left untreated. Chronic leukaemia starts gradually and progresses slowly taking many months or even years.In acute leukaemia the lymphocytes (white blood cells) are affected. Lymphocytes produce antibodies, which are vital parts of the body’s immune system.Years ago, a person with leukaemia was considered really hopeless. Advances in modern drugs and treatments have led to enormous improvements in survival and cure rates. Today, almost two-thirds of children and about 30% of adults are cured through strong drugs and chemotherapy.A new form of treatment is bone marrow transplantation. Here the bone marrow cells from a donor, is transplanted into the bloodstream of the patient. The new healthy bone marrow cells find their way to the bone marrow cavity and start producing normal blood cells.Modern research is still working towards early detection of leukaemia and easier and faster cure for this disease.","keyword":"[\"marrow\", \"leukaemia\", \"blood\", \"bone\", \"cell\", \"cancer\"]","ALS":"28.38095238095238"},{"english_id":"678","id":"679","level":"5","topic":"1","title":"What is Mad Cow Disease?","article":"In 1996, doctors detected 10 cases of a rare and fatal human brain disease in Britain and they diagnosed that it was probably due to eating beef from animals with “mad cow disease”. Scientifically, this cow disease was termed bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE while the disease affecting humans was termed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).The disease caused panic in Europe both among people eating beef and the farmers who were selling it. The European Union, which is the administrative body and includes all countries in Europe, responded immediately by banning imports of British beef.Illustration of a ‘mad’ cowHowever, do cows go really mad with this disease? Scientists and doctors who have been studying BSE in cows decided that it is similar to a sheep disease called scrapie. Scrapie, which was discovered in the 1700s, is a fatal brain illness that can pass from one animal to another in a herd.Scrapie attacks the brain and causes it to look like a sponge, as if full of holes. Hence the term “spongiform”. The disease causes extreme itching. Animals scratch themselves madly against fences, posts or other rough objects.Their movements, too, become uncoordinated. Some become nervous and skittish while others become extremely aggressive. Inevitably, the animal dies. There is no treatment or cure nor even an explanation why or how this disease occurs.Doctors discovered that the disease was being transmitted to cows through their feed. The cows were being fed a protein supplement from sheep called offal. In 1989, the link between sheep offal and BSE was firmly established and the British government banned the use of sheep offal to cattle.However, many people were still not convinced that this was enough. They figured that if cows could became infected by eating sheep offal, couldn’t people suffer a similar fate after eating “mad cow” meat or milk?In 1993, the BSE epidemic reached a peak with over 1,000 cases detected per week. However, the British government continued to argue that the mad cow disease could not harm humans.By 1996, it was discovered that over 160,000 British cows have been diagnosed with BSE. Then 10 people died and it caused a furore all over the world.There was general panic over this contaminated meat. Hotels and restaurants in Britain faced a slump as people refused to eat steaks or have milk or cheese products. People refused to buy beef and the meat rotted at the butchers. The European Union imposed a ban on British beef causing a war of words between Britain and the European Union.Nobody wanted anything to do with British cows. Other countries imposed a ban too. The British government decided that the only way to prevent other uninfected cattle from catching the disease was to slaughter the diseased ones.The Cambodian government even suggested that they be used to detonate over 10 million land mines left over from the Cambodian civil war.Further scientific discoveries did nothing to ease the problem faced the British government. It was discovered that the CJE disease has a 30-year latency (time between infection and the appearance of disease).This meant that the disease could be hidden and not be discovered for years! Secondly the disease-causing agent was very resistant.Ultimately, the government decided to slaughter the cows. This required over 2.6 million heads of cattle to be killed in the United Kingdom. Special arrangements were made for farmers to get the cattle to the slaughterhouse. The government also had to compensate the farmers for loss of livelihood.In 1998, the European Union was satisfied that the threat from the mad cow disease was eradicated and lifted the ban.Today, mad cow disease is still present in British herds, but in very small numbers thanks to changes in feeding practices and strict medical watch over healthy and suspected cattle.","keyword":"[\"disease\", \"british\", \"government\", \"sheep\", \"beef\", \"offal\"]","ALS":"26.5"},{"english_id":"680","id":"681","level":"5","topic":"2","title":"What is Physiotherapy?","article":"If you’ve ever been laid up in bed because of a broken leg, or with an arm in a cast, you’ll know how limp that limb feels when it is finally out of bandages.

It is also called physical therapy.Doctors who specialise in this branch of rehabilitation medicine are called physiotherapists or physical therapists.Interestingly, physiotherapy is helpful in almost every branch of medicine. Patients with paralysis, or muscle weakness caused by poliomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, with a heart or lung problem, or those recovering from broken bones, all need the help of a physiotherapist to get back on their feet.While the most basic and critical tool of all physiotherapists are their hands, they do use an array of devices too. Some devices heat parts of the body, since heat tends to lessen pain and improve blood circulation. Radiant heat lamps are used for warming up the body to reduce pain in the backbone.A room for physiotherapy with professional modern equipmentElectric heating pads, diathermy, hydrotherapy (water treatment) and special baths are used to apply heat to the diseased or damaged parts of the body.Cooling too is critical.

However, physiotherapists use a variety of equipment such as pulleys, weights, parallel oars, stationary bicycles and dumb-bells.Disabled people benefit greatly from the services of a physiotherapist.

But mention the word khus, and most people will be all-smiles. For this grass have the sweetest and coolest fragrance that beat the summer heat. That is why for centuries Indians have had vetiver or khus mats and screens in their homes. A steady sprinkle of water is enough to keep the hot summer wind out.Chrysopogon zizanioides, commonly known as vetiver found abundantly in India, is of Asian origin. It gets its name from the Tamil word ‘vetriver’, meaning root. From India it travelled to the West Indies, Fiji and Africa, where a new use was found for it – as a sponge to hold the soil in place and prevent erosion, according to a report by the Academy for Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehra Dun, in north India. Creating environmentally sustainable technologies at the local level, is its main concern.Chrysopogon zizanioides, commonly known as vetiver found abundantly in India.How does vetiver prevent erosion? The grass is planted in rows to form a hedge. This hedge allows the silt in the water to deposit on one side while water seeps into the ground through the other, instead of running off. Thus, vetiver conserves moisture as well as soil. As the silt builds up behind the hedge, the grass grows with it. Eventually, natural terraces are formed, held up by the tough roots of khus.Vetiver has tidy habits. It stays where it is: two rows of vetiver grass planted 60 years ago in northern Rhodesia were in the same place, in 1984. It produces no seeds and its roots are unadventurous. So it does not pollute the farmer’s crop. Its long roots enable it to survive droughts.There is more. The grass is fireproof and animal proof. No matter how hungry cattle are, they will not touch it.The virtues of the fragrant vetiver grass have been well-tested abroad. It was used in Fiji, 30 years ago, when severe erosion endangered the sugar industry. Yields doubled in the first few years after vetiver was put to good use. The land is healthy again, erosion has all but disappeared, and the farmers swear by this grass.The biggest irony is that vetiver has not been used for this purpose in India – the land where many claim it grew originally. There is no reason to think that it would not work here. The grass seems to be able to adapt to most of India’s climatatic variations. It is found in Karnataka as well as in the Himalayas, growing in any region that receives 200mm to 2000mm of rainfall annually.","keyword":"[\"vetiver\", \"grass\", \"erosion\", \"hedge\", \"root\", \"khus\"]","ALS":"19.92"},{"english_id":"686","id":"687","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"What is a Tornado?","article":"If you ever happen to see a dark often greenish sky, wall cloud, large hail and a loud roar similar to a freight train then run to a safe place as it could be a tornado.Popularly known as twisters, tornado is derived from Spanish word ‘Tronada’ meaning thunderstorm and ‘Tornar’ meaning to turn.A tornado is defined as a violently rotating column of air that can spin faster than 300 m.p.h., extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. They are generally observed as tube-or funnel-shaped clouds. At ground level they usually leave a path of destruction about 50 m wide and travel an average of about 8 to 24 km.Tornadoes generally exhibit a certain characteristic cycle of behaviour between formation and final disappearance. The first sign of a tornado may be a strong whirlwind of dust from the ground surface, often in conjunction with the appearance of a short funnel growing from the storm cloud above it. The funnel then becomes more organised and descends further from the cloud, sometimes touching the ground. The funnel as a whole moves forward slowly but can travel at speeds greater than 30 meters per second. The tornado eventually becomes fragmented and dissipates.A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the earth and the clouds.Tornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move over land. They are the result of great instability in the atmosphere and are often associated with severe thunderstorms. The full details of the formation of tornadoes are not known. Before thunderstorms develop, a change in wind direction and an increase in wind speed with increasing height creates an invisible horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere. Rising air within the thunderstorm updraft tilts the rotating air from horizontal to vertical.An area of rotation, 2-6 miles wide, now extends through much of the storm. Most strong and violent tornadoes form within this area of strong rotation. Softball size hail and damaging winds also occur with this storm.Tornadoes take many shapes and sizes. Weak tornadoes form 69% of all tornadoes and cause less than 5% of tornado deaths. The lifetime is 1 to 10 minutes and wind speed is less than 110mph. Strong tornadoes form 29% of all tornadoes and cause nearly 30% of all tornado deaths. They may last 20 minutes or longer and wind speed is between 110 to 205 mph.It is commonly believed that areas near rivers, lakes and mountains are safe from tornadoes. No place is safe. In fact in the late 1980’s a tornado swept through Yellowstone national park in the US leaving a path of destruction up and down a 10,000 ft mountain. It is also believed that windows should be opened before a tornado approaches to equalise pressure and minimise damage. However opening of windows only allows damaging winds to enter the structure. Leave the windows alone instead go to a safe place.Trivia about tornadoesAlthough tornadoes form all over the world, they are more frequent and stronger in US.A tornado that forms over warm water is called a waterspout. The water in the spout comes from condensation, not from the water below.When it forms over a desert, it’s called a dustdevil.Neither are strong tornadoes.The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 to 40 mph but can go as fast as 70mph and has rotational speed that can be more than 300mph.Tornadoes can occur in series (one after another) and more than one can form from the same cloud system.The worst series of tornadoes in history was on March 18, 1925. About 689 people were killed in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.Usually in the northern atmosphere (above the equator) tornadoes turn counter-clockwise (left).In the southern hemisphere, tornadoes usually turn clockwise.Tornadoes can be invisible!!! They appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up.Tornadoes can be over a mile-wide or really skinny.Tornadoes occur mostly in May. They occur the least in the months of January and February. Tornadoes occur most frequently during the middle and late afternoon.Scientists can’t rate or know how strong a tornado is until after it is over.","keyword":"[\"tornado\", \"thunderstorm\", \"cloud\", \"funnel\", \"wind\", \"speed\"]","ALS":"27.666666666666668"},{"english_id":"688","id":"689","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"What is a Volcano?","article":"What is nature’s most powerful, most destructive, most dangerous form? Some would say an earthquake, others a cyclone. However, these phenomenon are relatively smaller and less destructive in scale compared to the fury of a volcano.Fourteen miles southeast of Naples in Italy, lie the remains of an ancient town called Pompeii. The city flourished under the shadows of the towering Mount Vesuvius. In 79 AD, the volcano erupted, destroying the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae and Torre Annunziata.Mount Pelee, another volcano, arose from sleep in 1902 and wiped out the city of St. Pierre and its 30,000 inhabitants completely. The story of Mount St. Helens is even more terrifying. On 18 May, 1980, after days of volcanic activity, Mount St. Helens erupted.An avalanche of hot gases, rocks, ash and ice swept across the landscape at a speed of more than 250 kilometres per hour (160 miles per hour ) destroying 550 square kilometres (210 square miles) of mountain terrain, which is equal to an area almost as big as a small city. The area was home to an amazing diversity of plant and animal life.The volcanic matter went up to a distance of 20 kilometres in the sky, spewing gas, steam and ash straight into the stratosphere (one of the lower layers of the earth’s atmosphere).Let us try and understand what a volcano is.The Kilauea volcano erupts on the island of Hawaii with plumes of fire and smoke. Rivers of lava head to the ocean making new land.The earth has several layers under the surface. The upper crust on which we stay is called the lithosphere. Deep inside the earth’s body is the magma, which basically comprises rocks and other materials in a super heated state.Most things when heated to a certain point, melt and then turn into gas. So, the earth’s crust has a lot of gas which is constantly expanding, thus increasing the pressure inside.This magma tries to break through any weak spot on the earth’s surface. A volcano is basically this weak spot. It is a vent or a hole in the earth’s crust through which molten magma, gases and rocks are forced out because of the high pressure inside.In other words, the earth is like a pressure cooker of magma and hot gases. Whenever the pressure becomes too high, it forces some of its insides out. This is a volcanic eruption.Types of volcanoesVolcanoes are broadly classified into two categories based on the modes of eruption. They are the fissure and central types.In a fissure volcano, the magma oozes out of large cracks in the earth’s crust. The magma flow is not violent and its deposition forms new land forms like plateaus and even new islands.A central volcano is one in which the magma comes out of a small area on the earth’s crust called the volcanic crater. This is generally very violent in nature.Volcanic eruptions mould and shape the earth’s structure. They give rise to new land masses and constantly create changes in the earth’s atmosphere.","keyword":"[\"magma\", \"volcano\", \"crust\", \"mount\", \"volcanic\", \"earth\"]","ALS":"28.65"},{"english_id":"693","id":"694","level":"5","topic":"16","title":"What is the Mystery of Dracula?","article":"As bats flap through the musty castle, a coffin lid creaks open and an ashy white hand gropes for the cover. The lid slides off and a caped figure rises in the gloom – Dracula is on the prowl! Vampires have enthralled generations of readers and moviegoers; and the most popular ‘vampire’ is the fearsome Count Dracula of Transylvania.Of course, these blood-sucking monsters do not exist and are merely the figment of our imagination.Mystery of DraculaBritish writer, Bram Stoker, created the Dracula myth for his 1897 horror novel, ‘Dracula’. Many historians believe that Bram’s Dracula was inspired by a 15th century Romanian ruler named Vlad Tepes (pronounced “tsep-pesh”).Vlad ruled Wallachia (now part of Romania – in southeastern Europe) more than 600 years ago and is believed to have been very, very cruel. Vlad wasn’t a vampire at all, but he did invent some spine-chilling forms of torture and used the nickname “Dracul” or “Dracula” which means both “devil” and “dragon.”In the 21st century, Vlad’s terrible reputation is coming in handy for a cash-starved country. For the past few years, Romania has been cashing in on the Dracula myth by organising an annual World Dracula Congress in the city of Sighisoara. The birthplace of Tepes, Sighisoara is part of a larger region called Transylvania in western Romania.The festival sees the screening of vampire movies; and fans, moviemakers, writers and history students from all over the world participate.Discussions are held on Dracula legends, and debates on vampire myths are hotly contested. The festival is a huge tourist attraction and small Dracula souvenirs, including tiny coffin shaped boxes and bottles of blood red wine, are sold for profit.The residents of Transylvania are now hoping that the next step will be a Dracula theme park. Looking to boost the economy of the country, the Romanian government has made the theme park a top priority and negotiations are currently underway with foreign investors.","keyword":"[\"dracula\", \"vampire\", \"vlad\", \"myth\", \"coffin\", \"bram\"]","ALS":"41.22222222222222"},{"english_id":"695","id":"696","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"What is the Rubik's Cube?","article":"My nephew Akshay was a brat. No two ways about it. When he was not occupied with dismantling everything that moved, ticked, or clicked he would be engaged in stuffing an icecube down your shirt when you were busy working on whatever it is that didn’t involve him.After a lot of thought, my uncle and I decided to purchase something that would rack his brains till kingdom come. We scouted the market for all sorts of things and luckily we came to a shop that sold a colourful cube – the Rubik’s cube.Akshay was overjoyed at this new acquisition. He was lost to the world and every waking moment was spent trying to get the colours of the cube in order.No dice! He was truly stuck. He was loath to give up and admit he was lost. Days turned to weeks and into months. In sheer frustration he asked: just what is the Rubik’s cube?The Rubik’s cube was invented in 1975 by Erno Rubik, an Architecture Professor at the Budapest School of Commercial Art, in Hungary. It is a six-sided multi-coloured object that splits into three rows and three columns. Each row or column is capable of turning a full circle of 360 degrees.Thus each side is made of nine squares. Each side of the cube has a certain colour and when the rows and columns are rotated, these colours then shift to another side.The object of the game is to twist or rotate the multi-coloured cube and find a way to get all the sides to have a uniform colour. The orange side should have all nine squares orange, another should have all white and so on.What is the Rubik’s Cube?The problem with the cube was that there were over 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible positions into which the cube could be manipulated. It was not easy to find a solution to this cube. A wrong twist and the entire side changed colours!Erno Rubik wanted to teach aspects of 3-dimensional objects to architecture students. So he devised this cube and applied for a patent in 1975. The cube soon became a rage in Hungary. Rubik then figured, why not market it in Europe?So he contacted toy manufacturers in Europe and America. Ideal Toys contracted Rubik to produce it for the United States market. By 1980, the cube was the fastest selling toy in the market and shopkeepers couldn’t keep pace with the demand!In 1980 alone, the cube sold over 4.5 million units! Pirated versions began overtaking the original. Solving the cube in the fastest possible time soon became a fad and to help achieve this, several books were published giving the final solution and hints to achieve this in the shortest possible time.There were cases of solving the cube within a minute. A downslide to the popularity of the cube was that people developed painful muscular problems called tendinitus due to constant twisting and turning of the wrist!Unfortunately overexposure killed this wonderful, mathematical toy. Some me-too products tried to take on from where the cube left off but failed to catch on.What was meant for a classroom lecture demonstration twisted the world topsy turvy with a flick of the wrist. However, it is an excellent toy to pass the time with. And if you wish to exercise your wrist as well, there is nothing better than the Rubik’s cube to work on.

But if you say the weather’s OK in a lazy drawl, it could mean ‘so-so’. When you respond with an OK at the end of someone’s explanation, you could be saying, ‘Alright, I get what you’re saying’. And when someone explains that ‘This is the way to do it, OK?’ it means, ‘Have you understood?’One abbreviation, many meanings. And like all delightful accidents of history, the origin of this multi-faceted OK seems to lie in a humourous misspelling of the words ‘all correct’ as ‘orl korrect’, approximately 170 years ago, in the US.So says the dictionaries team of the Oxford Word and Language Service (OWLS), whose job it is to answer the queries of curious users of the English language. OWLS was launched by the Oxford University Press in 1983, which periodically publishes a compilation of many such queries. Among those questions is one on the origin of OK.Many other explanations have been put forth, such as the Greek ola kala (‘it is good’), and the French aux Cayes , (‘from Cayes’, Cayes being a Haitian port known for its good quality rum). Some have also wondered if OK originated from the initials of Obeidah Kelly, a railway freight agent who wrote his initials OK on the documents that he had checked!What is the origin of OK?‘Orl korrect’ seems to have won because it is supported by documentary evidence. Its earliest recorded use can be found in the Boston Morning Post of March 23, 1839. Though, in the 1840s, supporters of a politician Martin Van Buren formed the OK (Old Kinderhook) Club, named so after the birthplace Kinderhook (New York) of the politician.In fact, a judicial case of 1935 was decided on the basis of the ‘orl korrect’ origin of OK! It was a case involving a Japanese rice merchant, Nippon Menkwa Kabushiki Kaesha versus Dawson’s Bank, in the US. The rice merchant had written OK along with his initials on some of the invoices.

The world has been circumnavigated by sea by Marco Polo and people have walked across continents from end to end. But until 1924 no one had tried to circumnavigate the world by air except over a continent by a balloon in a Jules Verne novel.Eight Americans decided to circumnavigate the world by plane. So in 1924, they set out from Seattle Washington, USA, in four Douglas World Cruisers and 175 days later three of the aircraft and crew returned to set a new world record.The Douglas World Cruiser biplane was a variant of the United States (US) Navy’s DT-2 torpedo bomber that could be operated either with wheels or floats. After successful tests of the prototype or the original four aircraft were ordered. Each plane was named after a US city: ‘Seattle’, ‘Chicago’, ‘Boston’, and ‘New Orleans’.Extensive planning went into the preparation of the trip. The Royal Air Force of Britain and the US Navy dispatched 30 spare engines all over the world prior to the flight; 28 nations promised to supply fuel and oil along the flight path.On April 6, 1924, the four biplanes left Seattle and headed west. The first snag occurred within six days of flying when the ‘Seattle’ crashed near Port Moller, in Alaska due to heavy blizzards and thunderstorms.The remaining three planes continued on to Japan, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, Europe, England, and Ireland, completing nearly three-fourths of the planned trip.On August 3, the ‘Boston’ was forced down in the North Atlantic. A prototype was dispatched to Nova Scotia, Canada, and the crew renamed the aircraft ‘Boston II’ and rejoined the adventure. On September 28, the three biplanes returned triumphantly to Seattle after 175 days covering 44,360 km, with stopovers in 61 cities in a total flying time of 371 hours, 11 minutes.Since a circumnavigation had been done it became necessary to set a speed record in this category. In 1933, another American, Wiley Post, did a solo circumnavigation between July 15 to 22, in seven days, 18 hours and 49 minutes in his Lockheed Vega. He covered 25,110 km (15,596 miles).In 1949, US Air force pilots went one better with a non-stop flight around the world in 94 hours 1 minute on a B-50 Superfortress called the Lucky Lady II though they were refuelled in the air.Finally there was only one record left to be broken. To circumnavigate, nonstop, without refuelling. On December 14th, 1986, Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager flew a canard wing plane the ‘Voyager’ and took off from Edwards Air force Base, California.A canard wing plane the ‘Voyager’ flown by Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager become the first aircraft to circumnavigate the globe nonstop, without refueling. rook76 \/ Shutterstock.comCarrying an unprecedented 3,150 of fuel it took the ‘Voyager’ nine days, three minutes and 44 seconds to become the first aircraft to circumnavigate the globe nonstop, without refuelling.

Not just while doing math lessons at school, but also while counting money at the shop, memorising the numbers of our favourite TV channels or even keeping tabs on the number of hours we spend in front of the Internet! But we are so used to numbers that it has never occurred to us to find out where these numbers come from.For that, we must travel back in time. We must go back to 6th century India. It was around this time, that the great Indian astronomer Aryabhatta invented a set of numerals that is now used by people all over the world.You might already have heard that zero was invented in India. But it is not so widely known that even the other numerals were invented in India only. This is because the figures written as 1, 2, 3 etc. are commonly known as ‘Arabic’.This would naturally make it seem that the number system originated in Arabia and not in India. Sounds rather mysterious no? That something that was invented by an Indian scientist should be known as Arabic? But there’s quite an interesting story behind this.Sometime in the year 771, Arab merchants took some Indian scholars to Baghdad (the present capital of Iraq) to help teach them the new set of numbers. After learning the numbers, the Arabs translated the numbers into their own script that is Arabic. Sometime later, the Arab traders carried a book of these numerals (in their language or script) to Europe, where the numbers were translated into Latin. As the world at large got these numbers from Arabia, these came to be known as Arabic.In fact, it is interesting to note that there is another number system in use. This is the ‘Roman’ numerical system. The numbers in this system are written as I, II, III, IV, V etc. Although this number system is also a well-developed one, there’s one problem in it. Since there is no symbol for zero in it, there is difficulty in carrying out addition, subtraction and other calculations.Let’s take an example. In the Arabic number system the calculation of 2076+600, can be easily computed by arranging the numbers in two vertical columns;However, the same calculation is not so easy, when it comes to the Roman system. Why? Because under the Roman system the numbers are written differently. This is because M means a thousand, D stands for 500, C stands for a hundred, L for fifty, X for ten, V for five and I for one.It is amazing what a big difference the seemingly simple and valueless number ‘0’ can make. The small number ‘1’ can be turned into a million! a billion!! Or even a trillion!!! – Thanks to the magical powers of zero.Where did numerals originate?Here are some more interesting facts. The script of the Arabic language (not mathematical) moves from right to left, unlike English, which moves from left to right. However, Arabic numbers are written from left to right. Why? Because they were borrowed from India!Since the time they were invented, Arabic numerals have undergone only minor changes from the original Hindu manuscript. The numbers that have undergone slight changes include 4, 5, 6 and 7.So that is the “number story” – how numbers were born in India, travelled to Arabia and then to Europe. And now? Well, the whole world is using them all the time.

People in ancient times must have yelped like this when they walked on rough ground without any shoes on. And it was probably the pain and discomfort that propelled them to cover their feet for protection.Footwear has a history which goes back many thousands of years, and has long been an article of prestige for people in different societies.The earliest footwear, probably made of plaited grass or rawhide held to the foot with thongs was undoubtedly born of the necessity to provide some protection when moving over rough terrain in varying weather conditions.Scientists estimate the first shoes were made from animal skins during the Ice Age (5000,000 years ago). The biggest find of shoes from this period is thought to date back to 8000 BC and belonged to Native Americans in Missouri. Primitive shoes dating back to 3300 BC were discovered in the French Alps.And there still exist examples of footwear from ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Chinese and Vikings. As soon as human society started getting refined and was divided into classes, the rich and influential began distinguishing themselves by the craftsmanship and decoration on their shoes.Early paintings of Pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, around 3000 BC depict Pharaohs followed by their slaves bearing their sandals. The image suggests that in ancient Egypt the sandal was a sign of power and rank.The Greeks in ancient times took good care of their feet as well. They adapted their footwear for every type of activity. The height of the sole and the colour of the shoes indicated the wearer’s social class.Ancient Romans devised military style thongs called ‘caligae’, which enabled their legions to travel the empire on foot. The caligae was a sturdy thick-soled heavy leather sandal. When victorious soldiers returned from war they frequently substituted the bronze nails, which held the caligae together with gold and silver tacks.Even in Ancient China during 2nd century BC, shoes were a sign of status. Peasants wore straw sandals and aristocrats wore turquoise coloured fine cloth slippers sometimes made of silk. Also it was a common practice for the women to bind their feet in small shoes to make them real small. Although the practice was very painful, bound feet were a sign of beauty in ancient China.In India too, we find many references to simple footwear in the oldest of epics, the Ramayana. Lord Rama’s wooden sandals are mentioned prominently but they seemed to have been simple things. A flat wooden base with a toe hold sticking out, what is commonly called a khadau. References to Gautama Buddha also mention him taking off his sandals before leaving behind the life of a prince. That was 2500 years ago, in the fifth century BC.Footwear has figured widely in western mythology, folk stories and superstitions too. The Greek god Mercury wore winged sandals, and there are very few of us who do not remember childhood tales of Puss in Boots, the Seven League Boots, Cinderella and the Old Woman who Lived in a Shoe.Most cultures have stories where shoes play a starring role. No wonder. After all, these humble toe-holders protect us from the pricks and pins of life.","keyword":"[\"sandal\", \"shoe\", \"footwear\", \"caligae\", \"ancient\", \"thong\"]","ALS":"27.571428571428573"},{"english_id":"712","id":"713","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"Where are the Shaking Minarets?","article":"Among the many architectural marvels of the world, like the leaning tower of Pisa, the whispering gallery at St Paul’s Cathedral at London or the musical pillars of South India, are the astonishing and historical shaking minarets of Ahmedabad, in Gujarat state, India. The minarets are so unique that if one minaret in shaken, the other sympathetically shakes too!Barely a kilometre away from the Ahmedabad city railway station is the Sidi Bashir mosque (Muslim equivalent of a temple) famed for its jhulta minars or shaking minarets (tall tower-like structures, either at the entrance gate or on the four corners).Ahmedabad city was founded by Sultan Ahmed Shah I in 1411. The mosque and its minarets were built in 1461 and are popularly called Siddi Bashir’s mosque, after a favourite slave of the Sultan. However, there is no evidence of Siddi Bashir building the minarets and it is very likely that it was built by an architect Malik Sarang, a nobleman in the court of Sultan Mahmud Shah Begada, ruler of a nearby province.Surprisingly, when the minarets were built, there was no conscious decision made to make it shake! No one even noticed that it shook or leaned at an angle. The first person to notice that the minarets shake was an European Sanskrit scholar, Monier M Williams in the 19th century.He climbed to the top of one of the minarets and leaned against its wall and found that the minaret started to sway slightly as did the other minaret! Terrified that the tower was going to collapse, he hurriedly got down from the see-sawing minaret!Each minaret is three storied tall with delicately carved stone balconies around each storey. These minarets are about 21.34 meters (70 feet) high. If either of the minarets is shaken the other too vibrates after a few seconds. The vibrations at the base of the tower multiply and get transmitted through air tunnels between the two towers.Amazingly, the connecting passageway between the two minarets, however, remains free of any vibration!This shaking feature was quite common to mosques of Ahmedabad city such as the Jami-Masjid amd Bibi-ki-Masjid, too. The mosque at Raj Bibi once had a pair of shaking minarets. This excited the curiosity of the British, who were then ruling India. So they dismantled one minaret to study the secret of its construction and the mystery behind the swinging effect.Perhaps they are all on shaky ground here.However, there is a lot of disagreement over what causes this vibration and only research can throw light on the architectural marvel.Some say that it is a protection against earthquake damage. But no one has verified this theory. Others like The Archaeological Survey of India says that this medieval engineering feat could possibly be attributed to the use of ‘flexible sandstone’ (a construction material) in the foundation.There is no proof supporting these theories. The only thing known is that the minarets were not built with the plan that they would be shaken. This occurred over a period of time.India is one of two countries that boast of this phenomenon. At Isfahan, in Iran, is Menarjonban a historical building located in a village called Karlatan. Here too the minarets sway slightly when leaned upon.","keyword":"[\"minaret\", \"shake\", \"mosque\", \"ahmedabad\", \"lean\", \"bashir\"]","ALS":"31.31578947368421"},{"english_id":"713","id":"714","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Where did Coffee Originate?","article":"The aroma of coffee beans was one of the earliest smells to intoxicate me as a child – such was its flamboyant richness.

My childhood memories as well as my impressionable mind had prevented me from actually exploring the coffee trail, as the well-known nutritionist and food historian K.T Achaya has done in his fascinating work, ‘Indian Food Companion: A Historical Companion’.It is said that the earliest coffee plant may have evolved in Ethiopia, and possibly, only the leaves were chewed.

The first plantation in Brazil was set up a little less than 300 years ago, in 1727.There is an amazing story of how coffee started being grown in a big way in India. Around 1720, a pious Muslim, Baba Budan, returned from Mecca with seven coffee seeds.He planted these seeds outside his cave, in the hills of Chikmagalur, in south India (now in Karnataka). It is said that all the coffee plants growing there, descended from the plants that grew out of those seven seeds.Roasting Ethiopian coffee the traditional way.That area as well as the Nilgiri Hills, in the Western Ghats, soon became the centre of the coffee plantation industry in India, led by the British rulers of the time. It continues thus to this day.Hundred years ago, cakes of coffee powder were to be found in villages all over south India. The cakes were added to boiling water, and when the coffee powder settled below, the coffee drink was had with sugar and jaggery.Times change and tastes change. Today, many have coffee for its taste, while some have coffee for the smart image it creates.

Ragtime, hip-hop, be bop, cool, blues – the very names make your finger snap and do a Texas two-step, no?Jazz has often been called the only art form to originate in the United States, though even this is not exactly true. Jazz, is a kind of music that was sung or played by the African slaves in the plantations of America. In the 18th and 19th century, Africans were lured or kidnapped from their villages and sold in faraway America as slaves to work in large plantations.After a hard day’s labour, these people would gather together and sing, both to forget their worries and also to teach their children about the land and culture they came from.Different forms of musical notes from various cultures flowed across the Southern United States during the late 1800s. They were part of the cultural baggage that immigrants brought from their countries to the land that was the melting pot of cultures, America.Where did Jazz Originate?Jazz music thus, grew from a combination of African folk music and rhythms, Caribbean and black American music, as Africans have a very strong culture of singing and dancing.Early jazz music was basically the Blues, a soulful and heart-rending composition with simple and repeated harmonies performed by black musicians who had little or no training in Western music.The Blues was especially widespread in the American South. This was because the American South had the largest number of plantations and so also the largest numbers of slaves. Jazz instrumentalists have long exploited the blues as a vehicle for improvisation.Apart from its musical influences from Africa, the Caribbean, Latino rhythms, instruments like the clarinet and the saxophone also influenced the sound of jazz.By the middle of the 19th century, jazz grew in popularity and its sound became influenced by musicians with formal training and classical backgrounds.In the late 1890s a musical style evolved from St Louis called Ragtime. Its popularity quickly spread to other parts of the United States. This music style emphasized on formal composition and was played on the piano. The music was energetic and lively and quite different from the piano concertos associated with Western classical music. Naturally people loved it.From New Orleans in the American South in 1900, came a fuller Jazz, developed and refined by the French Creole. The Creoles are people of Caribbean origin, mainly from Haiti, once a French colony.The city had its own tradition of band music for street parades and this type of jazz was sometimes referred to as classic jazz, traditional jazz, or even Dixieland jazz. (During the American Civil War in 1865, the Union of the North and the Confederacy of the South were divided by the Mason-Dixon line. Since then, the American south is sometimes referred to as Dixieland.).New Orleans was the musical home of some of Jazz music’s greatest composers and players. These included cornetists Buddy Bolden and King Oliver, cornetist and trumpeter Louis Armstrong, pianist Jelly Roll Morton among others.Jazz soon spread from New Orleans to other parts of the country. A New Orleans Jazz band led by Fate Marable played on riverboats plying on the Mississippi River.The earliest Jazz recording was made in 1917 by a New Orleans band called the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. In 1920, Mamie Smith recorded ‘Crazy Blues’. Soon Jazz records were selling faster than could be recorded or produced.At the same time, radio became a popular feature in every home and commercial radio stations featured live performances from New Orleans, St Louis, Chicago and New York city.Jazz was actually widely appreciated as an important art form in Europe even before it gained popularity in the United States. Today, with variations in style and music, musicians from all over the world are making major contributions to jazz music.","keyword":"[\"jazz\", \"music\", \"orleans\", \"band\", \"dixieland\", \"culture\"]","ALS":"34.57142857142857"},{"english_id":"715","id":"716","level":"5","topic":"1","title":"Where did the Yo-Yo Originate?","article":"Yo! Man! Know where the yo-yo comes from? No, I am not asking you to name the local toy store. Sorry, let me rephrase it. Gimme its history, guys. You thought the yo-yo was created by Donald Duncan, huh? Forget it! The yo-yo is nearly a millennium old!So, it wasn’t called the yo-yo then. But for want of a better name let’s stick to calling it the yo-yo, okay? Kids all over the world have played with a similar toy. It is believed that the yo-yo originated in China. Ancient Greek kids (500 BC) played with a little spool-like toy and archaeologists have found samples in many other countries including Egypt.What was it like? Early yo-yos were made of wood, metal or even terracotta and decorated with paints. It consists of two discs connected by a small rod between the discs. A piece of string was tied to this rod and the other end was tied to a finger. The disks were rolled up on this string and when released the disk ran up and down this piece of string!Where did the Yo-Yo originate?As simple as that. From China the yo-yo moved to Europe. A 1789 painting of French king Louis XVII shows the four-year-old playing with the toy. Guess what they called it?- ‘incroyable’ and ‘l’emigrette’. By 1791, it spread through to Britain. Here it was called by a French word ‘bandalore’ don’t ask me why! It was called plain and simple ‘disc’ in Greece.It was in the Philippines that the yo-yo came to be called yo-yo! A yo-yo means ‘comeback’ which is what the toy does. In 1920, a smart Filipino, Pedro Flores, found that if he spent a few millions manufacturing this toy, millions would come back through sales. So he moved to the United States and in 1928 began a yo-yo company in California.His yo-yos were unique as they were the first yo-yos that did not have the string tied to the axle. Instead, the string was looped around the axle, allowing the yo-yo to spin or ‘sleep’ at the end of the string permitting the yo-yo to do an infinite number of tricks.In 1929, Flores sold the rights of the yoyo to another smart man, Donald F. Duncan Sr., American businessman and the inventor of the parking meter and the Eskimo Pie ice-cream.Duncan tentatively called it the ‘O-Boy Yo-yo Top’. The rest is yo-yo history. The yo-yo took America by storm and demand for the toy was greater than supply.However, Duncan had competition. In 1932, Duncan filed for and was assigned a trademark for the word ‘yo-yo’. This stymied the competition temporarily and Duncan’s competitors were forced to use terms like ‘come-back’, ‘whirl-a-gig’, etc. for their versions of the yo-yo.In 1946, Duncan moved to Luck, Wisconsin, which was lucky for him for a little while. Luck came to be known as the ‘Yo-Yo capital of the world’. In 1960, plastic yo-yos were introduced. Sales trebled. By 1962, the Duncan company alone sold a record 45 million yo-yos in a country with only 40 million kids.However, Duncan was fighting a losing battle with the trademarked word ‘yo-yo’. In 1965, the Federal Court of Appeals ruled against Duncan’s trademark for the word ‘yo-yo’. The term yo-yo had become so widespread that it was now a permanent part of the language and it no longer only described the toy.Duncan was forced to sell his trademark and name to Flambeau Plastics Company. Today, the Flambeau Plastics Company manufactures and sells eleven different models. However, Duncan was duly recognised for his effort. June 6, Duncan’s birthday, was deemed National Yo-Yo day in his honour.On April 12, 1985, the yo-yo was taken into space by NASA on the Space Shuttle Discovery as part of a project and even tested out.And, although the yo-yo has gone through ups and downs through the ages, its popularity has never gone down for good.","keyword":"[\"duncan\", \"string\", \"trademark\", \"sell\", \"axle\", \"flambeau\"]","ALS":"18.951219512195124"},{"english_id":"716","id":"717","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"Where does the Pigeon Post Operate?","article":"Among birds, pigeons have a natural and unerring instinct of returning to their nests or homes after long flights. In the early days besides domesticating animals like the horse, dog and cow, people also bred pigeons to carry messages back and forth. These pigeons are called homing pigeons.Racing pigeons have a life span of 15-20 years. A healthy bird can fly stretches upto 1,000 km. Normally the message is tied around the feet of the pigeon in a plastic capsule to protect the paper. Two pigeons are released with the same message, as pigeons are prone to attacks from other birds of prey particularly the hawk.Pigeon post is the use of homing pigeons as messengers due to their natural homing abilities.Legends have it that lovers exchanged notes and messages with the help of these homing pigeons. However, the first recorded instance of a pigeon post was in 1146 A.D. when the Caliph of Baghdad (in Iraq), Sultan Nuruddin used pigeons to carry mail through his kingdom.During World War 1 (1914-18) a homing pigeon of the American army saved a battalion from being captured by the Germans. In India, emperors Chandragupta Maurya (321-297 B.C.) and Asoka were said to have used pigeons couriers.But, the establishment of a regular mail service by Alauddin Khilji (1296 A.D.) and the onset of the postal service with the invention of telegraph and later telecommunications, put an end to all that. Today, we have mobile phones and satellite communication to connect to any part of the globe.However, even in this day and age, the police in Orissa state in India, still use pigeon posts. In 1946, they procured 40 pigeons and trained them on three courses: static, mobile and boomerang.In the static category the pigeons are taken by the squad to remote areas of their territory to communicate with headquarters. In the mobile category, the pigeons are taken to various places of operation.These positions may vary from operation to operation so the pigeons are trained to home in to the headquarters. In the boomerang category, the pigeons are trained to deliver and return with the message.Homing pigeons are however not cheap to maintain. They require a good diet and rooming space. These racing pigeons live on a special diet of shark liver oil mixed with potash dissolved in water.The Orissa police have established regular pigeon posts at Cuttack, Chatrapur, Kendrapara, Sambalpur and Denkanal and these pigeons rose to the occasion in times of emergencies and natural calamities.During the centenary celebrations of the Indian postal service in 1954, the Orissa police pigeons demonstrated their capacity by conveying the message of inauguration from the President of India to the Prime Minister.","keyword":"[\"pigeon\", \"message\", \"post\", \"mobile\", \"orissa\", \"category\"]","ALS":"32.53333333333333"},{"english_id":"718","id":"719","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"Where is the Tower of Babel?","article":"The ‘Tower of Babel’ is a structure that is mentioned in the Bible in the Old Testament in Genesis. The Biblical account describes how the descendants of Noe who migrated from Armenia towards Babylon (in Mesopotamia) decided to build a city and a tower whose architectural excellence would make them famous. But, God caused confusion by confounding their tongues, so that they did not understand each other’s speech. Slowly they moved away from that place and they ceased to build the city.Interestingly, historians and archaeologists (people who study old ruins) have searched for this tower and city, but haven’t found any documentary proof that the tower existed.Tower of Babel (Babylon), a famous painting by Pieter Brueghel the Elder created in 1563.However, there is a reference to this tower of Babel in the ‘History of Berosus’ written by Abydenus. Here, the tower is referred to as being built at Babylon on the banks of the river Euphrates.Most scientists follow the common opinion which identifies the tower of Babel with the ruins of the Birs-Nimrud, in Borsippa, situated on the right bank of the Euphrates outside the city.The tower itself must have resembled similar constructions that have been excavated. Most of these structures are in ruins but they are similar in shape and structure to ancient pyramids of Egypt in that cubic blocks of masonry have been piled one on top of the other to form various stories.An inclined stairway leads from one story to the other. Some of the excavated towers at Ur and Arach (in present day Iraq) are two or three stories tall, while others have six and even seven stories.The similarity to the pyramids is reinforced by the fact that the corners of these towers (sides of the Egyptian pyramids) face the four points of the compass.At its very top is a room that could have been used as a place of worship or as an observatory. Some historians say that nearly every Babylonian city possessed such a tower or ziggurat (a pointed, high memorial).Anyway, irrespective of whether the tower existed or not, the term ‘Tower of Babel’ has now come to signify a confusion of noises all speaking at the same time so that no particular dialogue or sentence is decipherable.","keyword":"[\"tower\", \"babel\", \"babylon\", \"ruin\", \"pyramid\", \"confusion\"]","ALS":"52.25"},{"english_id":"720","id":"721","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"Which Film Stars were Inventors Too?","article":"Most movie fans have seen or at least heard of Hollywood legends Hedy Lamarr and Steve McQueen. But how many know that these two were inventors who have significantly changed our lives. Nobody? Not surprising.But it’s true. Hedy Lamarr and Steve McQueen were both Hollywood stars and inventors. Hedy Lamarr thought of torpedoes guided by radio signals and Steve McQueen invented the bucket seat that has revolutionised the automobile industry.However, Hedy’s invention was never used for the purpose invented. Instead it is now used in satellite communications today.Hedy was born Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler on November 9, 1914 in Vienna, Austria. Best known for Hollywood director Mel Brooks “cowboy” film parody ‘Blazing Saddles’, she started her movie career at 17 when she was discovered by Max Reinhardt. Among her first films was the 1931, German film ‘Die Koffer des Herrn O.F.’ (The Suitcases of Mr. O.F.).In 1933, she married Friedrich (Fritz) Mandl, an arms dealer. Being exposed to weapons and weaponry, she came up with the idea of a radio-controlled torpedo. She soon learned that radio signals could be easily jammed and dropped the idea.In 1937, Hedy left Austria and her husband to shift to America, like many artists who were becoming uncomfortable in Adolf Hitler’s Germany with its increasing shades of Naziism.On the ship Normandie, she met Louis B. Mayer who signed her for a seven-year contract with MGM and she changed her name to Hedy Lamarr in memory of the silent screen actress Barbara La Marr.When World War II was declared in 1939, Hedy again brought up the subject of a radio-controlled torpedo. She suggested the idea to music composer George Antheil.Hedy Lamarr invented and filed a patent the radio-controlled torpedo.They realised that if they were able to change the radio signal frequency at random intervals (called frequency hopping) the the signals could not be jammed and torpedo would work. In June 1941 they filed a patent for their invention.Unfortunately the patent expired in 1959 without anyone making any use of it. It was ironic that the U.S. military simply let the patent languish. It was only in 1997 that the invention was formally acknowledged.Instead of “frequency hopping”, the term used today is “spread spectrum” which was tested to make cellular phone calls more secure from eavesdroppers.Unfortunately for Lamarr, who could use some of that money, the patent expired long ago.Steve McQueen’s life is a rags to riches story. Born in Beech Grove, Indiana, on 24 March 1930, Steve was the product of a broken home. Coming into the movies, Steve McQueen became one of the most popular stars and basked in the adulation of his fans.Though born in Indiana, Steve was raised by his great-granduncle in rural Missouri. In his early teens his family moved to Los Angeles, where Steve drifted into petty crime. He was arrested for stealing hubcaps from cars and sent to reform school – the Boys’ Republic in Chino, California. Reform school really straightened McQueen out.McQueen drifted to Hollywood and eventually to films where he hit stardom. He is credited with being one of the best actors in Hollywood history and his films are considered classics.Acting in films such as ‘The Great Escape’, ‘The Sand Pebbles’, (for which he received an Academy Award nomination), ‘The Thomas Crown Affair’, ‘The Magnificent Seven’ and ‘Papillon’ among others, McQueen loved to play characters who had a secret sorrow in life that made them different from others — more a reflection of his childhood.McQueen, like other film stars James Dean and Paul Newman, was addicted to living in the fast lane. He was well known as a racing car driver and loved to race and tinker with engines on and off camera. Initially McQueen even contemplated the idea of designing clothing accessories for auto racers and motorcycle racers.A motoring enthusiast he found racing cars had poorly designed seats leading to driving problems. Racers were fidgeting in their seats, craning their necks and hurting their back instead of relaxing and being comfortable. So he designed a seat, which took the shape of the human back.On December 8, 1969, he filed for patent for the invention of the bucket seat. The bucket seat took the auto world by storm. Today, it is the basis for almost all roadsters and grand prix machines on the racetrack and on city roads.","keyword":"[\"mcqueen\", \"hedy\", \"steve\", \"lamarr\", \"film\", \"patent\"]","ALS":"28.310344827586206"},{"english_id":"721","id":"722","level":"5","topic":"16","title":"Which Galaxy is Visible to the Eye?","article":"The sun we see everyday is just one of the thousands of stars we see at night.

The most famous and the brightest of these is the M31 or the Andromeda galaxy.The spiral galaxyAndromeda galaxy is visible to the eyeThe Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million light years away, simply put light takes 2.5 million years to travel from Andromeda to earth. It is believed that Andromeda has about 400 billion stars. This makes it almost twice as big as our Milky Way.The Andromeda galaxy is spiral in shape, and like other spiral galaxies, it is a giant pinwheel of stars, gas and dust. And it has two smaller satellite galaxies quite like the way the moon is a satellite of the earth.A Persian astronomer named Al-Sufi described it in his Book of Fixed Stars in 964 AD as the ‘little cloud’. Indeed! If you are able to spot it on a clear night, it does look like a tiny cloud. Andromeda was rediscovered in 1612 after the invention of the telescope by the German astronomer, Simon Marius.For centuries, the Andromeda galaxy was thought to be a part of the Milky Way. It was only in the 1920s that Edwin Hubble a famous astrophysicist, determined conclusively that the Andromeda was indeed a galaxy.A celestial collisonScientists say that all the galaxies are racing away from each other. But the Milky Way is actually racing towards the Andromeda galaxy. And the enormous gap between the Milky Way and Andromeda is closing at about 500,000 kilometers an hour. This pace will quicken as the two galaxies near each other.John Dubinski, professor of astronomy at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics points out that the two galaxies are actually on a collision course. They may collide almost three billion years later.","keyword":"[\"galaxy\", \"andromeda\", \"milky\", \"star\", \"spiral\", \"astronomer\"]","ALS":"23.5625"},{"english_id":"722","id":"723","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Which Insects Live the Longest?","article":"Take a look around. Which insects do you see? A fly sitting on your computer screen, a mosquito buzzing in your ear just as you drop off to sleep, a butterfly flitting about in the garden outside, or how about the ants that made off with the remains of a dead moth?Most of the insects we see around us have rather short lives. A few hours, a few days, that’s about how long most insects last. We don’t notice them dying out because they’re promptly replaced by a new bunch. Yet, some insects live comparatively really long lives.The longest living insects are the Splendour beetles (Buprestidae), some of which remain in the larva stage for more than 30 years. Queen termites (Isoptera), previously thought to live 10 years or more, are now known to have a maximum life span of about 15 years.Apart from these two insects, the Cicada actually lives for 17 years. The lifecycle of the ‘music-making’ Cicada is very interesting. The female Cicada lays eggs in the twigs of trees. When the young one (nymph) is hatched from the egg, it drops down to the ground.Then it burrows itself into the ground and attaches itself to the roots of plants and trees. Here it remains motionless for about 17 years, sucking at the sap of the roots. After this long ‘burial’, it is driven by some mysterious instinct to move out towards the light. It climbs the tree trunks and its skin splits open. The mature Cicada emerges.A termite queen can live for 45 yearsFor about five weeks, the Cicada leads an active life in sunlight. After this period it just dies. It spends 17 years buried under a tree for just five weeks of active life!The male Cicada makes a shrill sound, which can be heard in the countryside. This is probably a mating call to the females. According to scientists, the noise-producing organs of the Cicada are probably the most complicated musical organs found in nature. The male Cicada has little drum-like plates, which constantly vibrate by muscles that never seem to tire.There are more than 800 species of Cicada, 100 of which are found in North America. The 17-year Cicada is found only in the United States.

It’s no wonder that the subzi mandis (vegetable and fruit markets) get flooded with mangoes in summers.Forget the fact that the country produces millions of mangoes, do you know how many varieties there are? Thousands! Some of the popular ones are Alphonso, Dassehri, Banganapalle, Langra, Safeda, Neelam and Chausa. With so many varieties in the country, people have created varieties with fancy and romantic names, like Husn-e-Ara and Jehangir.Mango orchards cover roughly 33% of the total area under fruit cultivation in India making it abundant fruit in the country.The different varieties are also due to experiments in grafting where a bit of the stem of one variety is cut and another variety is placed over it. It is exactly like breaking a bone and the doctor sets it right by putting splints and tying it up.The first such experiment on mango breeding was carried out in 1911 by two biologists, Burns and Prayag. Their purpose was to develop varieties possessing regular fruit-bearing habits, good fruit quality, and a good yield that is disease resistant.The most commercially viable variety today is the Alphonso and Dassehri varieties. The Alphonso originated in Ratnagiri district in the state of Maharashtra while the Dassehri from village Dassehri near Malihabad in the state of Uttar Pradesh. A 150-year-old ‘mother tree’ is found here, said to be one of the oldest and first in the line of Dassehri trees.Malihabad near Lucknow is more famous for another reason.

Many of the animals in the seas, skies, and earth live long lives. Yet the oldest living creature in the world is an immortal jellyfish that has never died. Its family name is Turritopsis Dohrnii. It hails from a class of small animals that live mainly in saltwater.The Dohrnii begin their life journey as larvae with a diameter of no more than 4 millimeters. The larvae have a tiny vase-shaped body with a mouth surrounded by tentacles. They come together and attach themselves to the ocean floor. Soon, they mature into jellyfish. Once they mature, they travel great distances and hunt other fish for food. The Dohrnii has currently spread across three continents by hitchhiking on the underside of cargo ships. Due to their tiny size, the countries they are invading are unaware that it is even happening.Turritopsis dohrnii medusa Source : Bachware \/ CC BY-SA 3.0 ]When a Dohrnii jellyfish is exposed to shock, these marvelous creatures reverse their aging process and slowly turn back into larvae, to be reborn again when the danger has passed. It is the only biological example of true immortality. Turritopsis Dohrnii achieves this through a process that is quite remarkable. The cells of the larvae get assigned roles before maturing. The roles are assigned by a tiny strand of genetic material called MiRNA. MiRNA decides which jobs a mature cell receives. When the jellyfish receives a shock, MiRNA begins converting the jellyfish cells back into larvae. Scientists are studying this to see if it can be used to reverse the aging process in other species.The biggest danger to these immortal jellyfish comes from sea plankton, which eats them for survival. Dohrnii are hard to study because of their size and are hard to keep alive in captivity. Today, only one scientist, Shin Kubota from Japan University, has managed to keep them alive. The Dohrnii jellyfish provides the only known method for a living being to cheat death and its secrets are yet to be fully uncovered.Honorary mentions:Greenland Shark: Oldest recorded - 400 yearsBowhead Whale: Oldest recorded - 211 yearsGalapagos Giant Tortoise: Oldest recorded - 152 yearsAfrican Elephant: Oldest recorded - 86","keyword":"[\"dohrnii\", \"jellyfish\", \"larva\", \"mature\", \"mirna\", \"immortal\"]","ALS":"19.571428571428573"},{"english_id":"726","id":"727","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Which is the World's Oldest Working Locomotive?","article":"The Indian Railways is one of the world’s oldest railways dating back to 1849.

The Indian Railways is also the world’s single largest employer with about 1.6 million people working in nine zones.Among its many unique gems are the toy train that runs on the Darjeeling Himalayan rail route, the rack railway at Udagamandalam in south India, the busiest narrow gauge network in the world, etc. However, the pride of place goes to the ‘Fairy Queen’, a living locomotive legend. So what’s so special about it? Well, it is the world’s oldest locomotive still in operation on a main line transporting tourists from Delhi to Alwar in Rajasthan.Looking at the ‘Fairy Queen’ you cannot guess that it is nearly 145 years old, as she was first commissioned way back in 1855!The Fairy Queen was built by the British firm Kitson, Thomson and Hewitson of Leeds to run on a broad gauge track (5 foot 6 inches). Weighing all of 26 tonnes, the locomotive was a type 2-2-2 WT (under slung water tank) with a double plate frame and its original maker number was 481.In 1855, she was delivered to the East Indian Railways (EIR), the company that pioneered railway network in India, and renamed EIR 22. The East Indian Railways used the locomotive to haul mail trains between Howrah and Raniganj in West Bengal state. This distance of 121 miles was covered at a leisurely pace of 25 miles per hour taking 5 hours in all.In 1857, she was put into troop transportation during the first Indian war of Independence. In 1881, her number was changed to 92 and she was renumbered 101 in 1884. In 1895 she was finally named ‘Fairy Queen’.The Fairy Queen ended her working life in 1909 as a construction engine on the Bihar (a state in India) lines. The same year she was withdrawn from service and placed outside Howrah station in Calcutta where she made her debut.From 1909 to 1943 she stayed there and she was then shifted to the Zonal training School at Chandausi. In 1973, she came to Delhi during the inauguration of the Rail Transport Museum.However, till 1997, she still could not claim the title of the oldest working locomotive as another engine, the ‘Tweed’, built by Dubs of Glasgow, Scotland in 1873 was regularly chugging and wheezing at Sarayu Sugar Mills, in Gorakhpur, in the state of Uttar Pradesh.But Fairy Queen refused to be an ‘also ran’ and be relegated to the railway archives. The Indian Railways decided to restore the engine to working condition more as a tourist attraction for steam engine enthusiasts, India is among a handful of countries that still operate coal and steam engines.In 1996, the Fairy Queen was restored at the railway yards at Perumbur in Chennai. On October 31, 1998, she was pressed into action to ply on select days between Delhi and Alwar, a distance of 143 kilometres.Pulling a two-bogie train the locomotive regally chugs out of Delhi Cantonment station, working to a fever pitch of a maximum speed of 40 kilometres per hour. And the grand centenarian that she is, she stops six times in between to get her breath back and of course to stock up on water and coal.Though we said restoration, nothing needed to be restored as everything in the locomotive is still original and in pristine condition – the copper boiler furnace as well as the steam regulator and a blast from the old whistle never fails to bring people young and old alike to stand and gape and wave wildly as the locomotive chugs merrily by the Indian countryside.","keyword":"[\"locomotive\", \"railway\", \"fairy\", \"queen\", \"indian\", \"chug\"]","ALS":"43.8125"},{"english_id":"727","id":"728","level":"5","topic":"14","title":"Which is the fastest animal on earth?","article":"Peregrine Falcon is the fastest animal on earth – it can fly nearly as fast as an airplane.Peregrine Falcon is one of the rare birds that thrive in urban environments. It uses tall skyscrapers as launchpads and hunts pigeons and ducks. It is the world’s most widespread bird of prey and one of the most widely found bird species. It also has a good relationship with humans who use it for hunting.Known as the Duck Hawk in North America, it is a falcon. It has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black colored head. The Duck Hawk is known for its speed. The fastest recorded speed it has reached is 389 km\/h (242 m\/h). It uses this speed while hunting, flying high above its prey and swooping down at a frightening pace.Hunting at such a speed is no small feat and its vision has evolved to help it. Peregrine Falcons have the highest visual processing speed of any animal. Human beings, for example, can register about 24 images per second. Any faster than that and the human eye can not see the individual images but continuous motion, like a film. Incidentally, this is perhaps the reason why historically films were shot at 24 frames per second. The peregrine, however, can register up to 129 images in a second as individual images. This is how it keeps a precise eye on its prey even at 389 km\/hr.Adult of subspecies pealei or tundrius by its nest in AlaskaThe Peregrine has evolved to deal with high speed.

It has three eyelids that clear away debris and protect its eyes from the air pressure. Once it spots its prey, it tucks its wings and tail and begins a rapid dive. It clips its prey, usually on the wing to protect itself against the shock of impact. This usually kills its prey, at which point the Peregrine continues its descent, turns in mid-air, and catches its prey with its legs. It is truly a sight to behold. If the prey is too big to carry, it will let it fall and eat it there.During the 19th century, the Peregrine nearly became extinct. They were killed to protect messenger pigeons. The human pesticide DDT also prevented them from having chicks. After various conservation attempts, the number of Peregrine Falcons has revived. Since 1955 they have been a protected species and have received various honors. It is the national bird of the United Arab Emirates and the state bird of Chicago, USA.","keyword":"[\"peregrine\", \"falcon\", \"prey\", \"speed\", \"duck\", \"image\"]","ALS":"18.14814814814815"},{"english_id":"728","id":"729","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"Whick Book Carries Its Own Light?","article":"How many times have you been told not to read in bed and how often have you been ticked off for reading in poor light? Probably quite a few times if you are an avid book-worm. Now you can cast away your small flashlights and get rid of your reading lamp, for there are specially designed books that create their own light!The glowing bookProfessor Janos Hajto of Napier University, Edinburgh, has created a book with special plastic sheets that glow in the dark. He calls his invention ‘Freelight’.Freelight uses a concept similar to “glow-in-the-dark” toys, but is much more powerful. The pages of the book have been created after adding a light-emitting dye to thin plastic sheets. The dye makes the pages glow in dark and enables you to read this book even when the lights are off.A glowing dyeSo how does this dye glow? Certain materials can absorb energy and emit it in the form of light. If the interval between absorption and emission is short (within a second or two, as in tubelights) this process is called fluorescence; if the interval is slightly longer, the process is called phosphorescence. Freelight uses phosphorescence to create its own lightIn a Freelight, the dye absorbs light from the environment and re-emits it after a while.Unlike solar panels, which rely on direct sunshine, Freelight absorbs enough energy even on a dull day. Professor Hajto points out that since Freelight does not use electricity, it could be an economical way not just to light up books but to illuminate entire streets, computer screens and hoardings!For once, no one can complain that the light is not bright enough for reading!","keyword":"[\"freelight\", \"glow\", \"book\", \"hajto\", \"phosphorescence\", \"reading\"]","ALS":"31"},{"english_id":"729","id":"730","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"Who Invented Band-aid?","article":"What happens when you have a small wound? Just apply a small piece of sticky plaster with gauze (a loosely-woven cotton surgical dressing), or band-aid on it for a few days, and ta-da, your wound is healed!What a stupendous item this band-aid is! So ideal for accident prone people, whether adults or kids. Well it was exactly for this reason that Earle Dickson invented it. He did it for his wife, who though not into rough contact sports was nevertheless accident prone.Earle Dickson was an employee of the American company producing baby and surgical products, Johnson & Johnson. Although the band-aid was Earle’s invention, the company image has overshadowed the inventor.Who Invented Band-aid?In the 1860’s, British surgeon Sir Joseph Lister pioneered sanitary operating room procedures. During those days, surgery was done with bare hands. People were even allowed to observe the operations. Instruments were not sterilized – only washed with soap and water.Lister came to America and lectured on the need for sanitation to prevent germs and bacteria from attacking the human body. Robert Johnson, a chemist from Brooklyn, New York was impressed by this talk and he and his brothers decided to produce safe sanitary equipment for surgical purposes. They set up a company called Johnson & Johnson.In 1920, the company launched a dry gauze dressing that remained sterile in germ-resistant packaging and a baby powder to help new-born babies from getting rashes and sores.Earle Dickson was an employee at Johnson & Johnson. His wife was very accident prone, always cutting and bruising herself. Earle found the company’s large dressing too cumbersome to fix the numerous cuts and bruises. And so he cut the large bandages and affixed smaller pieces of the gauze on surgical tape.The bandage was less cumbersome and easier to handle. Encouraged, he took the idea to the Johnson brothers who realised the market potential of the product.The first band-aids were handmade and quite large: 18 inches long and two-and-a-half inches wide. But initial market reaction was negative and the product wouldn’t move across the counter. The company then revamped the product by cutting down to a more suitable size and introduced it in a new package in 1924. And sales skyrocketed.However, Earle Dickson the inventor, was not totally ignored. Johnson & Johnson made him a vice president, and later gave him a seat on the board of directors.Today, Band-Aid (a registered trademark) sales exceeds $30,000,000 per year and production is in excess of one hundred billion. And it’s all thanks to an accident-prone woman, and a man who stuck some gauze on a tape!","keyword":"[\"johnson\", \"gauze\", \"earle\", \"dickson\", \"surgical\", \"company\"]","ALS":"24.4"},{"english_id":"731","id":"732","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"Who Invented Traffic Lights?","article":"Long before roads needed traffic lights, railways were using a system of signals to control train traffic. In the early railways, a single track was used for both up-going and down-going trains, and safety depended on spacing the arrival and departure of trains according to time intervals.These signals consisted of a ball and something that looked like a kite. When the kite was raised on top it indicated danger while if the ball was raised, it indicated the all clear.In 1841, the first semaphore (visual form of signalling) railway signal was installed at London station. This consisted of a signal arm in a horizontal position to express ‘stop’. If lowered to 45 degrees it urged the engine driver to proceed with caution and if pointed vertically skyward it indicated the track was clear. The signals were painted red as it was easy to identify and attract the driver’s attention.At night, oil lamps were added on top of these poles and a red light indicated ‘stop’ while a white light indicated that the driver could proceed.However, the white coloured light proved disastrous as it stood for both ‘the all clear’ and ‘warning indications’ and so resulted in many accidents.In January 1876, the engine driver of the Flying Scotsman, an express train, rammed into a freight train running ahead on the same track because of the confusion in the signals. The derailment blocked the track in the opposite direction. This caused a major accident as the Manchester express train, which was running on this track, crashed into the already derailed bogies, killing 13 people and seriously injuring 24 others.Following this disastrous accident, the signal system was modified. First, the normally displayed indication for ‘stop’ became red while an additional yellow light was added to indicate to the driver to proceed with caution. In 1893, green lights replaced the white light to avoid confusion as street lighting and house lighting hampered the driver from reading the signal rightly.Since railway signalling was introduced, civic officials decided to try it out in the congested streets of London. Thus, even before the advent of motorcars, traffic lights were introduced in 1868 in London to control the flow of horse buggies, wagons and pedestrians.This signal was a revolving lantern with red and green signals. Red meant ‘stop’ and green meant ‘caution’. The lantern was lit by gas and turned up by means of a lever at its base so that the appropriate light faced the traffic.But in an unfortunate incident this traffic light exploded, on January 2, 1869, injuring the policeman who was operating it.With automobiles being introduced in America and Britain the traffic situation was getting problematic. A police officer called William Potts of Detroit, Michigan, decided to do something about the problem and he decided to adapt railroad signals for street use.His real problem was that rail traffic ran along one way while traffic flow at intersections ran at right angles and were four-way.Nevertheless, he used two-coloured lights, red and green, and connected the signals by electricity. The first traffic light was thus installed in 1920 on the corner of Woodward and Michigan Avenues in Detroit.But these lights were manually operated and were still two-way lights. At about the same time, Garrett Augustus Morgan Sr., an African-American, from Cleveland, Ohio, realized the need for traffic lights after seeing a collision between an automobile and a horse-drawn carriage.Distressed by the accident he decided to do something about it and on November 20, 1923 patented the four-way traffic light signal.Who Invented Traffic Lights?Today, traffic lights have an internal timer that is programmed to stay on for a specific amount of time. Policemen also control the lights on certain roads depending on the amount of traffic.Morgan’s invention has indeed saved many thousands of lives and created vehicular order among chaos. So next time you wait at a red light, Relax, and thank Garrett Augustus Morgan for his invention.","keyword":"[\"traffic\", \"signal\", \"driver\", \"track\", \"train\", \"caution\"]","ALS":"40.388888888888886"},{"english_id":"732","id":"733","level":"5","topic":"18","title":"Who Invented the Frisbee?","article":"At first glance in the park or at the beach, you may confuse it for an UFO (unidentified flying object) and rush home thinking the Martians have really landed from outer space! Soon it becomes clear that the “spacecraft” is actually a harmless toy — a colourful Frisbee, and the creature from outer space is the boy next door!Today, almost all of us have seen one or sent a Frisbee gliding through air. We have seen dogs chase it and leap to catch these flying discs. The toy has proved enormously popular and there are Frisbee throwing competitions held in America.Who Invented the Frisbee?The flying disc was named Frisbee after a 19th century Connecticut Yankee called William Russell Frisbie, a baker by profession. In 1871, he was hired to manage a branch of the Olds Baking Company.He soon bought it outright and named it the Frisbie Pie Company. It offered a variety of baked goodies, including pies and cookies.The pies and cookies were packed in round tin containers and sold to the students of Yale University, nearby. After eating the pies, the students would have fun tossing the round tins in air.The tin throwing craze would have died but for the shrewd sense of one man: Walter Frederick Morrison from Utah. Morrison had served in the World War II.Like many people during the 1930s and 1940s, who claimed to have seen blinking lights and flying saucer-like objects from outer space, called UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), Morrison, too, was bitten by the UFO bug.This craze had reached its peak in 1938 when a science fiction story by HG Wells was dramatised on radio by an actor called Orson Welles.Called the ‘War of the Worlds’ the radio play, aired in New York, made the fiction seem a reality by announcing that little green men from planet Mars had indeed invaded the earth. Listeners who did not know that it was a play thought it was the latest news and ran out in the streets in fear.Morrison was smart enough to think of cashing in on this flying saucer craze. He took lids of cans and welded a steel ring inside the rim to improve the plate’s stability. But this wasn’t very successful.In 1951, Morrison improved upon his model and the design. As it was to look like an UFO, he redesigned it with small portholes to give it a realistic touch.In California, Rich Knerr and A.K. Melin, who had started a little toy company called Wham-O saw Morrison’s flying saucers being flown on the beaches. In 1955, they bought over Morrison’s flying saucer.In 1957, the company introduced it in the market under the name Pluto Platter, inspired no doubt by the UFO craze. In 1958, while on a trip to Yale, Knerr heard the words “Frisbie” and “Frisbie-ing” as well as the story of Yale college students throwing pie tins. Therefore he decided to call Pluto Platter by the new name of Frisbie.Frisbie, thus became a registered trademark for the plastic disc.The Frisbee has glided a long way from its pie-tin days. Today it is a fun game played by millions. To have fun, the toy just needs two arms – one to throw and one to catch, not necessarily your own.","keyword":"[\"frisbee\", \"morrison\", \"craze\", \"frisbie\", \"yale\", \"throw\"]","ALS":"33.888888888888886"},{"english_id":"733","id":"734","level":"5","topic":"9","title":"Who Invented the Photocopying Machine?","article":"We have all used it at one time or another to copy our school documents, or parts of a book borrowed from the library, or just about anything we wanted a copy of. It’s just a matter of pressing a button of the xerox machine and hey Presto! a piece of paper comes out at one end, an exact duplicate of the document we needed copied!However, when the invention was first patented, nobody wanted anything to do with it. Major corporations like IBM, Kodak and General Electric rejected the offer to develop it, perhaps regretting the decision to this day! However, the blood, sweat, and tears of its inventor, Chester F. Carlson did not go wasted, as the success of the machine proves today!Chester Carlson, the inventor of this machine was born on February 8, 1906 in Seattle but grew up in California. In 1930, he received his degree in Physics from California Institute of Technology.Chester Carlson invented photocopying. catwalker \/ Shutterstock.comHowever, it was the depression era and there were no jobs available. Ultimately Carlson got a job at P. R. Mallory in New York city, a battery manufacturing company. During this time, Carlson studied law at night school and ensured a somewhat steady job at Mallory in their patents department as a patents ‘lawyer’.Carlson found that each patent had to be copied many times by hand or photographed before it could even be submitted to the patents office. Both methods were tedious and time consuming.This tedium was the root cause for Carlson to invent the much needed photocopier that we take for granted today. Carlson reasoned that there must be a better way to make copies and he decided to find out.He spent months going through various scientific articles but could find no solution. He reasoned that the answer lay in the new field of photoconductivity, a field recently discovered by Hungarian physicist Paul Selenyi. He had discovered that when light strikes the surface of certain chemicals or metals, its conductivity (flow of electrons) increases.Carlson realized that if the image of a document or photograph was to be projected onto a photoconductive surface, current would flow only in the areas where the light falls.He worked at his invention from the kitchen of his house and arrived at something he termed ‘electrophotography’. His first patent was applied for in October 1937.In the beginning large corporations did not show any enthusiasm in the project as it would have cost them an initial investment of millions of dollars.At this time Carlson came in contact with Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit organisation that invested in technological research. Battelle promised to help Carlson and signed a deal giving Carlson a 40% share in the proceeds.Battelle assigned the project over to a man named Roland M. Schaffert, a research physicist and a former printer. Schaffert worked on the project for nearly a year. He then improved on Carlson’s technique by using a new photoconductive plate covered with Selenium, a better photoconductor.Battelle researchers also developed a dry ink, which they called a toner. This toner was made of ammonium chloride salt and a plastic material to get a clearer image.On January 2, 1947, Battelle signed an agreement with a small company known as Haloid to manufacture this electrophotograpy technology and the first photocopiers were introduced in the market in 1949.However, the flat plate process was very prolonged and was impractical when making a dozen or more copies. At this time somebody suggested that Haloid use the term xerography for this technology from the Greek words xeros for “dry” and graphos for “writing”. Haloid thus named its first photocopier the XeroX Model A. In 1958, Haloid officially changed their name to Haloid Xerox, and finally to Xerox in 1961.Success didn’t really come to Haloid Xerox until they introduced the Model 914, in 1959. It was called ‘914’ because it could handle paper legal size paper which is 9 inches x 14 inches in size.This was the model that hit it big that by 1965 earned Xerox revenue over $500 million dollars and today Xerox is such a household name that people confuse the name of the company for the process called photocopying!Sometimes we mistakenly say “can I have a Xerox of this document?” don’t we?

He was born in 1890 in Czechoslovakia. Though brilliant as a child, he turned to a life of crime, excelling in gambling, card games and scams.Lustig became a riverside gambler plying the various cruise boats that invariably consisted of the rich and famous. Here he met other experts and under their tutelage fine-tuned his skills.In 1922, Lustig landed in Missouri, USA and decided to lease a farmhouse, which a Missouri bank had reclaimed from its owner for failing to pay back debts to the bank. Assuming the role of a rich Count, Lustig approached the bank with a riches to rags story and how he wanted to settle down and work on a farm.As proof of his intentions, Lustig offered $22,000 in bonds to the bank and also convinced the bank to exchange an additional $10,000 of bonds for cash. The bankers gladly obliged. However, Lustig switched the envelopes and made off with both bonds and cash.The bankers hired a private detective who traced him to New York city. While bringing him back Lustig convinced the bankers that if they did press charges, the negative publicity would cause a run on the bank by its depositors.To top it all, Lustig insisted that the bank give him $1000 for the inconvenience that the arrest had caused him and then coolly walked away with the loot.Lustig then moved to Canada on ‘business’ where he conned another banker into placing bets on ‘sure fire’ wins in horse racing. Having won over the banker’s confidence with a few such wins, Lusting pressed the banker to make a largish bet. Naturally Lustig walked away with the money.The scam that really took the cake was the selling of the Eiffel Tower (Paris’ most famous landmark built in 1889). In 1925, Lustig moved to Europe as both the US and Canadian police were after him. He shifted base to Paris in partnership with another trickster called Dapper Dan Collins.The French government was at that time trying to get the Eiffel Tower repaired. Newspapers covering it also mentioned in passing that the cost of repair were more than the cost of tearing down the tower.Lustig immediately hit upon a terrific scam. He decided that he would sell the rights to tear down the tower. He then went about making elaborate precautions. First, he printed some official looking stationary. Then he sent letters to various scrap iron dealers inviting them to discuss the government contract.During the discussion Lustig announced that the Eiffel Tower was being scrapped as in the last 35 years the steel had rusted. He invited them to submit tenders and bids and also played up on the secrecy part as it could raise a public hue and cry.Lustig had already chosen his victim and informed him that he was winner of the bid. Lustig approached the Frenchman and indirectly hinted that he wanted a bribe before the bid could be approved. The Frenchman gladly offered him the bribe and also the tender money for the sale of the Eiffel tower.Immediately after, Lustig and Dan Collins escaped to nearby Austria. But, the Frenchman, either due to embarrassment or shame never reported the scam and Lustig again came to Paris and sold the Eiffel Tower to another gullible dealer again!However, Lustig’s luck ran out as the victim complained to the police. Lustig was lucky enough to be one jump ahead of the French police.Many were the scams Lustig attempted, like the ‘money’ making machine in which one enters a real note and it duplicates itself. By this time Lustig had joined hands with a forger named William Watts. Soon they were circulating counterfeit US currency in large numbers.In 1934, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) finally caught Lustig with thousands of counterfeit money. Put in the Federal House of Detention in New York city, Lustig however, managed to escape from prison the day before his trial.Recaptured a month later, Lustig was sent to Alcatraz prison, in California in 1935. On March 9, 1947, Lustig contracted pneumonia and died.Victor Lustig made full use of the adage “there’s a sucker born every minute”. Though crime never pays and the criminal is ultimately caught, conmen survive only because when it comes to the thought of making easy money, even the smartest get suckered.Aside: If Victor Lustig was the king of conmen with forty-five known aliases and nearly fifty arrests in the United States alone, Natwarlal or to use his real name, Mithilesh Kumar Shrivastava, was his Indian counterpart. Natwarlal swindled, duped and conned people of over a crore of rupees.","keyword":"[\"lustig\", \"banker\", \"eiffel\", \"bank\", \"tower\", \"conmen\"]","ALS":"31.857142857142858"},{"english_id":"735","id":"736","level":"5","topic":"18","title":"Who discovered Vaccination?","article":"“Mom, I have a stomach ache and I am feeling sick!” Try this out at home and the quick response is bound to be, “Don’t worry, we will take you to the Doctor!” More often than not, if the ache is because you haven’t done your homework, the mere mention of the word ‘doctor’ cures you. Of course, if the problem is genuine no one will know the cure better than a doctor.Edward Jenner was an English physician who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine — the world’s first vaccine. rook76 \/ Shutterstock.comKnow what the scariest thing about a doctor is? – that invariably you get an injection for all aches and pains. Do you know that a newborn child is given vaccination for many diseases? You may throw a tantrum and scream your head off to avoid the injection and inwardly mutter death threats at the person who invented such a painful method for treatment, but the fact remains that whenever we are sick an injection does the trick.How did it begin? It so happened that one day in 1768, a young milkmaid visited a doctor in Gloucestershire, England. Though nearly everyone in the district was then sick with smallpox, a dreaded disease at that time, the milkmaid was not affected! In the eighteenth century, smallpox was a killer disease, as widespread as cancer now, but with the difference that the majority of its victims were young children.When the doctor asked her the reason, the milkmaid remarked that she had already had cowpox, a disease with symptoms similar to those of smallpox, though in a very mild form. The significance of her remark was not lost on a young medical student, Edward Jenner, who was also present there.Jenner was intrigued by this simple explanation that those who caught cowpox could not catch smallpox. After getting his degree, he returned to Gloucestershire to practice medicine and to devote his spare time in research and investigation. He found out that the milkmaid had been right: people who had cowpox very rarely caught smallpox.On May 14, 1796, another milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes, came to Jenner with cowpox. He conducted a daring experiment. He took some of the virus from the boils on Sarah’s hands and passed on the disease to James Phipps – his gardener’s son – by scratching his skin with infected metal (vaccination). When James had recovered from the cowpox, Jenner tried to give him smallpox. James failed to contract the disease.Edward Jenner had discovered a cure for smallpox! Jenner named this inoculation process, “vaccination”, from the Latin name for cow (vacca) and cowpox (vaccinia).Vaccination at first had many opponents, but eventually its value became firmly established. Today not only has smallpox been nearly wiped out but you can get vaccinated or immunised against many other diseases too! And it is usually performed right from the birth of the child.","keyword":"[\"smallpox\", \"jenner\", \"cowpox\", \"milkmaid\", \"disease\", \"ache\"]","ALS":"29.157894736842106"},{"english_id":"737","id":"738","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"Who is the real McCoy?","article":"Ever heard the expression, is that the “real McCoy?” No, its not the musical group we are talking about.

McCoy invented and patented all kinds of mechanical things to help them work smoothly, efficiently and safely.Over time, the expression “real McCoy” has been used for anything that means the real thing, the real solution.Elijah McCoyElijah McCoy was born in 1843 at Colchester, in Ontario, Canada to George and Mildred McCoy. His parents had once been slaves at a large manor in Kentucky, America. However, they managed to escape to Canada before the American Civil War began in 1865. Following the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery and the McCoy family returned to settle at Ypsilanti, Michigan.As a child, Elijah was fascinated with all things mechanical. Encouraged by this interest Elijah’s parents saved money and sent him to Edinburgh in Scotland to study mechanical engineering.He soon returned with an engineering degree but as a “black man” and “negro”, as blacks have been addressed in scorn, Elijah couldn’t find work. Though slavery had been abolished and people of African origin were now considered American citizens, white Americans treated the Afro-Americans as inferior people. Their hearts and minds were still very racist.Afro-Americans were not allowed to vote nor given prominent jobs even when they were educated. Elijah with his engineering background could only get a job shovelling wood in locomotives for the Michigan Central Railroad.Part of his job was to oil the engine parts when the train stopped to take on water. Elijah decided to work on this problem of oiling the parts as the Michigan Railroad and other railways were finding it expensive and time-consuming. In 1872, he came up with a self-lubricating device for the steam engine and applied for a patent.A stamp printed in USA to honor railroad engineers of America. AlexanderZam \/ Shutterstock.comInitially his invention was smirked at and pooh-poohed because he was a black man. However, it was quite evident that his invention worked and the railroads took notice. Industrialists soon began to insist that the “real McCoy” or the self-lubricating device be installed in their engines.Elijah, the real McCoy, became famous. His name became synonymous with things that worked as against advertising gimmickry.In 1920, Elijah established his own factory, the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company, at Detroit, Michigan to manufacture products. He never looked back and never stopped inventing.Soon he had applied for over 50 patents in the U.S., Canada, Britain, and in various countries in Europe. All his inventions had to do with his love for mechanics.

The most brutal sport that has ever existed in the history of the world was the fights between gladiators. The ‘sport’ traces its roots to the custom among the Etruscan people, a civilisation in Italy that existed before the Roman civilisation. At the death of the master of the house, servants would duel to the death for the right to follow their owners in death and provide help and company.Image of a gladiator carved on concrete wallThe first ‘gladiatorial games’ were ‘offered’ in Rome in 264 B.C by sons of Junius Brutus Pera in their father’s honour after he had died. A gladiator was either a professional fighter or a slave, trained to entertain the public by engaging in combat with another person.Gladiatorial combat soon became a very popular form of public sport. People began to offer these ‘games’ and the number of matches. While the earliest gladiatorial combat consisted of three matches, a century later, Titus Flamininus offered 74 matches lasting over three days!At first the fights were confined only to funeral ceremonies, but gradually they became the chief amusement of the Romans and were held in huge arenas.Early gladiators were prisoners of war or slaves or condemned criminals but soon free citizens became gladiators hoping to win fame and fortune. With the popularity of these games, the State assumed greater control, and gladiators were trained in imperial schools. Under a manager, a troupe of gladiators could be sold or hired out, and wealthy citizens hired many as bodyguards.The Colosseum in Rome, Italy was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. KKulikov \/ Shutterstock.comIn Rome, the fights were first staged in the markets and then in the Forum, where temporary stands were erected. Amphitheatres (open air theatres) were constructed so people could watch these games. The largest of the amphitheatres was the Amphitheatrum Flavium, or Colosseum, which was inaugurated by Titus in 80 A.D. that could seat as many as 50,000 spectators.Called the games or circus, the spectacle was usually staged for Caesar and Rome. On the day of the games, the gladiators were ceremoniously led in and paraded around the arena before presenting themselves at the emperor’s podium. The gladiators wore splendid armour of gold and silver.After the parade, there was a mock battle with wooden weapons to build up the appetite of the spectators. Then the fight was begun in earnest with a variety of weapons. Wounded gladiators could lay down their shield and raise the left hand to plea for mercy where it was left to Caesar to decide his fate. As patron of the games, it was Caesar who made the final decision, although it often was necessary to appease the whims of the public.Caesar decided based on what the public wanted – a thumbs up sign and the gladiator’s life would be saved. If they held their thumb down the victim was killed.Victors were awarded crowns or a palm branch and whatever prize money that had been set before the start of the games, as well as any money awarded by the crowd.With the passage of time, the Romans got bored with even those ‘mild’ battles and invented new spectacle like women gladiators. However, Emperor Septimius Severus outlawed the practice.Increasingly, the fights became more and more bloody. Gladiators were set to battle with lions, tigers and other wild beasts. There were many efforts to stop these cruel sports. Thankfully in 326 A.D., Constantine abolished the games and the remaining schools closed by Honorius in 399 A.D. But gladiatorial combats continued, in one form or another, until 404 A.D., when Honorius finally prohibited them altogether.","keyword":"[\"gladiator\", \"game\", \"rome\", \"gladiatorial\", \"battle\", \"combat\"]","ALS":"30.434782608695652"},{"english_id":"740","id":"741","level":"5","topic":"11","title":"Who was the US President for a Day?","article":"Quick all you quizzards and prospective Who Wants to be a Millionaire candidates: Who was the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Presidents of the United States?

Dallas’ term had also expired along with Polk’s and in fact, Dallas had earlier resigned on March 2.Under the American constitution, it is up to the President pro tem of the Senate to take on the mantle of presidency as the post of vice-president and president lies vacant. The Senate president was David Atchison at that time even though the Senate had been dissolved.President’s Day — President for a day!As per US constitutional law, the Senate leader continues to retain his seat even as the House is dissolved or suspended till such time a new session begins.David Atchison, thus, became interim President for a 24-hour period, even though he was never elected to the office. On March 4, 1849 David Rice Atchison was sworn in as acting President. A new vice-president was also sworn in – Millard Fillmore. In fact Fillmore went on to become President sixteen months later following the death of Zachary Taylor.This question of whether David Atchison was actually president or not has been hotly debated. However, he did step into the presidency. March 4, 1849 was an uneventful day in American history. Being a Sunday, Atchison was able to have a relaxed day at the White House.","keyword":"[\"president\", \"atchison\", \"polk\", \"senate\", \"david\", \"zachary\"]","ALS":"26.5"},{"english_id":"751","id":"752","level":"5","topic":"9","title":"Why Does Time Start in Greenwich?","article":"Its six in the morning and the sun is streaming through the window of your home in Delhi. In New York, people are just packing up to go home as it is six in the evening!Nothing amazing about it. We know that the earth is round and that it revolves once in 24 hours. So while it is daytime in the east, it is still night in the west.But for ages, people measured time based on the position of the sun – it was noon when the sun was highest in the sky.Even in the Middle Ages, when mechanical clocks began to appear, cities would set their town clock by measuring the position of the sun. But every city would be on a slightly different time.So while some snored their way through the night a relative from a hundred miles away who had come visiting was kept awake and fuming outside the door! People wouldn’t accept the fact that time varied from village to village and they wasted more time fighting over this.Actually the confusion began with the invention of the clocks itself!Clocks were first invented in China around 100 A.D. from the earlier sundials which were simple devices that marked the movement of the sun with the movement of the earth. By 1300 A.D., large clocks with weights were invented and these consisted of gears that moved the hands. The problem was someone had to constantly reset the weights.In 1510, Peter Henlein of Germany discovered the spring-powered clock and in 1656, Christian Huygen, a Dutch scientist, patented the pendulum clock.Soon, several clocks sprung up in most towns and villages. This abundance of clocks caused confusion as each clock was set for noon for that particular village. But this problem was not taken into account until the postal service began.For ages, people measured time based on the position of the sun – it was noon when the sun was highest in the sky.Early posts were delivered by runners and they were supposed to wait for each other at a certain time at an appointed place. But while it was noon at village A, it was still 11 a.m. at village B a hundred miles westward and so the runner would not be present at the appointed time.By the next century when the railways were developed, it was altogether a different story. With the railways connecting distant towns and cities, it became imperative for passengers to know when the train would arrive and also what time they would reach their destination.Sometimes travelers missed their connecting train as various towns stuck to local time calculated according to the sun at noon. For instance, if the distance between New York and Chicago was to be covered in 18 hours and the train left New York at 10 a.m., it reached Chicago 18 hours later. No doubt it reached at 6 a.m. New York time, but the Chicago local time was something like 10 p.m.Britain was the first country to accept that a standard time was necessary and decided to adopt a single consistent time across the country to regulate train timings. The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828), which was taken up and implemented by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903). The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway in November 1840.However, the United States was a different story. It is so vast and as we know today, each state is in a different time zone. So while it was day in the east in New York, it was probably noon in Illinois and night in California.In November 1883, the U.S. and Canadian railways decided to adopt a standard time but there was much confusion as to what place should be taken as the prime median from which the standards could be set.In 1884 a Canadian railway engineer Sir Sanford Fleming suggested that the entire world be divided into time zones that would be calculated from a prime meridian. This would help calculate various time zones relative to that one.In October 1884, an International Meridian Conference met in Washington DC to settle the matter. Twenty-four countries participated and they chose Greenwich, a village just outside London in England as the prime meridian. However, two countries did not approve of the location.Why Greenwich? The delegates decided to adopt a meridian line at 0 degrees that passes through Greenwich. A principal transit instrument at the Observatory at Greenwich was to be established and this would be taken as the ‘initial meridian’.The prime meridian marked on the floor at the Royal Observatory in GreenwichSince the world was round and a circle consists of 360 degrees, the longitudes (horizontal lines dividing the world) would be calculated both east and west from this meridian. A universal day would thus be the mean solar day beginning at midnight at Greenwich and counted on a 24 hour clock.Though a majority agreed to establishing a Greenwich Mean Time or GMT as the world standard, enforcing this wasn’t easy. France refused to accept GMT till 1911.Countries that did approve the resolution also did not bother to incorporate GMT. For example Liberia did not incorporate GMT until 1972. Detroit for example, adopted GMT until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should be put back 28 minutes to Central Standard Time. Funnily enough, while one half the city adapted this Central Standard Time the one half of the city stayed with local time.Today, though there are discrepancies in timing, there are 24 different time zones established, demarking time across the world.","keyword":"[\"clock\", \"meridian\", \"greenwich\", \"standard\", \"village\", \"railway\"]","ALS":"35.82142857142857"},{"english_id":"752","id":"753","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Why Don't Spiders Get Caught in Their Webs?","article":"Spiders are not insects but are classified by biologists as arachnids. Arachnids are different from insects as they have eight legs and no antennae. There are over 40,000 species of spiders and some of them build webs while others rely on speed to catch their prey.A spider building its web is extremely fascinating to watch. Some spin these webs by squirting silken threads from modified excretory glands in their body. Each silk gland (some species have up to five) produces a different type of silk. Some silk glands produce a liquid silk that becomes dry outside the body; while other glands produce a sticky silk that stays sticky.Inside the spider’s abdomen are small organs called spinnerets that secrete the silk. A spider can stretch out each spinneret, pull it back in, and even squeeze them all together. Using different spinnerets, a spider can combine silk from different silk glands and produce a very thin thread or a thick, wide band.Not all parts of the web are sticky. A spider can control how much stickiness it needs to cover the web. Often the first strand is coated with a heavy layer of gum. This is carried in the breeze and sticks to a distant wall or branch.Why don’t spiders get caught in their webs?Next the spider weaves the outer spokes of the web and spirals inwards with dry silk. Finally it follows the outer layer eating some strands and replacing them with stiky silk.Some species (such as the water spider) use it to build underwater nests, while others make draglines to ride, using the wind to travel great distances. (Wherever a spider goes, it spins a silk thread behind itself. This thread is called a dragline).The dragline is also called a ‘lifeline’ because the spider often uses it to escape from enemies. If danger threatens a spider in its web, it can drop from the web on its dragline and hide in the grass. Then it climbs back up the dragline into its web. Strangely enough, baby spiders are not taught to spin webs, apparently the act comes naturally!Web spinning spiders have hard bristles on the underside of their legs. These bristles slot themselves over the silk thread and act as runners or skates. The spider can thus run freely over the web without getting stuck.To resist its own web trap, a spider’s body also produces an oily non-sticky coating. However, if by chance a spider manages to get entangled it eats its way out.","keyword":"[\"spider\", \"silk\", \"dragline\", \"thread\", \"gland\", \"spin\"]","ALS":"23.3"},{"english_id":"754","id":"755","level":"5","topic":"17","title":"Why are Human Voices Different?","article":"Imagine a scenario. A criminal is being tried in court. He denies saying something. The prosecution brings a recording, saying they have his confession on tape. As the accused vigorously denies the voice being his, an expert shows just why the voice could be no one else’s.A fictional scene? Perhaps, but it is a reality that no two persons in the world have exactly the same voices. Do you know why this is so?The act of speaking involves movements of hundreds of muscles in split-second coordination. The speech organ called larynx or voice box is capable of producing an infinite number of sounds. It is that part of the throat through which air passes. When we breathe, air passes through the larynx downwards, through the mouth and nose, into the trachea (windpipe) and finally to the lungs.The larynx is made up of a tough wall of cartilage. Its inside lining has two folds of tissue stretching on each side and leaving a gap between them. These are called vocal cords. When a person is quiet and breathing, the gap between the cords remains wide open. The cords are slack.But talking, singing or shouting involves the tightening of the cords; the exhaled air causes the cords to vibrate and produce sound. Our vocal cords can be in any of about 170 different positions.If the vocal cords are slack, they may vibrate about 80 times per second and the result is deep tones. If they are tense, they vibrate rapidly, perhaps a 1000 times a second, and produce short sound waves or high tones.As a child has short vocal cords, they produce short air waves and consequently a high pitched voice. As a child grows, the vocal cords become longer. That causes the voice to become deeper. Thus,k the voices of adults are heavier and deeper than children’s voices.Similarly, the voice of most adult men is deeper than those of women. This is because a man’s larynx is larger than that of a woman. It also has longer cords.The pitch of voice depends upon the length of the vocal cords. Each voice has a certain range of frequencies. It is this range that determines the kind of voice a person has. Voices can be divided into six groups: bass, baritone, and tenor for men, and alto, mezzo soprano and soprano for women.The quality of human voice also depends on many other things such as resonating space, lungs, nasal cavities etc. The nose, sinuses, pharynx and oral cavity act as resonating chambers and modify the vocal tone produced by the vocal cords.The movement of the tongue against the palate, the shaping of the lips and arrangement of teeth also bring about changes in the voice. Since the structures and movements of all these organs are different in different persons, the voices of no two persons in the world can be identical.","keyword":"[\"voice\", \"vocal\", \"larynx\", \"person\", \"vibrate\", \"deny\"]","ALS":"20.884615384615383"},{"english_id":"756","id":"757","level":"5","topic":"6","title":"Why are Some Plants Non-vegetarian?","article":"Are you scared of going to the forest because you think there are man-eating tigers in the forest? What would you do if there were man-eating plants too?Don’t worry. Man-eating plants do not exist. But insect and animal-eating plants do. They are what you would call non-vegetarian plants.In fact, there are 500 varieties of plant species that trap prey and eat it. The most famous among these carnivorous plants are sundews, pitcher plants, bladderworts and the Venus flytrap.These plants are found in places with an acidic soil that lacks nutrients essential for the plant to make food.Actually it is not as if these plants cannot survive without being non-vegetarian. Like other plants, they also use light, carbon dioxide and water to make their food. But, without non-vegetarian components in their diet, they will lose strength and become easy victims of predators. They might even lose the fight for survival as their competitors take over.Most of these plants have worked out complex ways to catch their prey. The pitcher plant’s leaves are shaped like pitchers and a part of the leaf forms the lid. The mouth of the pitcher secretes a sweet-smelling substance, which tempts insects to the trapdoor. Once they step on to the threshold, they are tempted to move further to hunt for the source of the nectar. That proves to be the fatal step for them as they lose their grip on the slippery slope and fall into the pitcher. Some pitchers are big enough to kill small mammals, scorpions and reptiles. Nepenthes rajah, a species in Borneo, has pitchers, which are up to 35 cm long and 18 cm wide — large enough to trap a small rat.Although the sundews also use a sticky substance like the pitcher plant to attract their victims, they use a more active device to catch them. They have tentacles that close in on the prey the moment it lands on the leaf.The Venus flytrap’s leaves have fine hairs-like structures that are sensitive to touch. When an insect touches the trigger hairs, the leaf folds along its midrib, closing with such speed that the victim cannot escape.The bladderwort, which lives in water, uses something similar to a mousetrap to get its food. Its trap, which looks like a bladder, is sealed to maintain a partial vacuum and has a trapdoor entrance. The trapdoor has fine trigger hairs that are sensitive to movement. The bladderworts also use a sticky solution of mucus and sugar as bait. When an animal gets attracted by the sugary solution, it brushes against the trigger hairs, and the trapdoor flies open and the bladder sucks in water because of the partial vacuum in it. The victim is swept inside helplessly along with the water and the trapdoor closes on it. All of this happens in ten to fifteen thousandths of a second, so fast that human eyes may not be able to take in the action.After the victim has been trapped, the plant uses either bacteria or enzymes to absorb its nutrients.You will be surprised to know that it is not only plants that are carnivorous. Some fungi also have similar eating habits. The genus Dactylella is one of them. It strangles eelworms. It has threads known as hyphae, which form loops and when a worm puts its head or tail into the loop, the noose tightens. The fungus then sends out other hyphae to eat the corpse.","keyword":"[\"pitcher\", \"plant\", \"trapdoor\", \"victim\", \"bladderwort\", \"trap\"]","ALS":"22.642857142857142"},{"english_id":"769","id":"770","level":"5","topic":"15","title":"Why do Earthquakes Occur?","article":"As a result of upheavals below its surface, the earth shakes now and then. This shaking of the earth is known as an earthquake.Few natural events are as violently destructive as an earthquake. It usually strikes without warning, giving off violent vibrations in the process. These vibrations not only shake the ground but also sometimes crack it open. And then, there is chaos, for earthquakes have been known to wipe out cities and civilisations.About a million earthquakes occur in one year, but most of them are small tremors. And almost 90 percent of them occur underwater along the “ring of fire” that circles the Pacific Ocean. Other areas that are prone to earthquakes are the Alpine belt stretching between Spain and Turkey, through the Himalayas to Southeast Asia.Why do earthquakes occur? The earth is made up of many layers. The outermost layer or lithosphere, below the surface, is called the shell or crust. It consists of seven huge slabs or plates, which are as thick as approximately 100 km (60 miles) that move at the speed of 10 centimetres a year. Picture these tectonic plates carrying continents and ocean floors on their shoulders, for that is what they do.Most earthquakes take place along the boundary between two plates. The slow but constant movement subjects the plate borders to tremendous stress, which builds in the bedrock for decades and centuries.When the strain produced by these movements increase beyond a certain level, the pent-up energy cracks up the rocks and creates a fracture known as a fault. This sudden release of energy also unleashes ground-shaking vibrations. These vibrations or seismic waves are what make up an earthquake.If you drop a stone in a pond, ripples are created. The seismic waves travel outward in all directions from the quake’s focus, in a similar manner. Waves that reach the surface spread out in concentric circles from the epicentre. The epicentre is the spot on the ground that lies directly above the focus.Recording instruments called seismographs have helped geologists identify types of seismic waves, and the most damaging waves among them.In the 1930s, the Richter scale was developed to compare earthquake intensities worldwide. The scale measures the amplitude or the entire range of ground motion, and not the amount of damage caused. The most powerful earthquakes to be recorded by the scale, which starts at zero, are in the range of eight or nine on the Richter scale.A major quake is often followed by many smaller tremors known as aftershocks. They release any energy still left in the rocks and occur in parts of the fault where the original quake took place.One of the most destructive earthquakes in India occurred around the Brahmaputra Basin and neighbouring regions in Assam, in northeast India, in 1950. Besides major landslides and rifts, it destroyed hundreds of villages and killed many people.In recent times, one of the worst earthquakes in India took place in 1991 in the Chamoli-Uttarkashi region of northern India. As a result, over 2,000 people were killed, more than 1,800 were injured and 18,000 buildings were destroyed.Earthquakes can be severe enough to alter the topography of a region. An earthquake that occurred in Japan in 1923 caused major land upheavals throughout the Kanto region, which was the epicenter. The floor of Tokyo Bay rose three metres, while the nearby Izu Peninsula was shoved nearly four metres to the west. It was the worst in Japan’s history.Japan and neighbouring regions are among the most earthquake-prone regions in the world. The San Andreas fault in California is another. The fault makes the region very prone to earthquakes, the most recent one being in the Landers region, in 1992.While scientists have still not been able to predict an earthquake, they have identified certain indicators that foretell an earthquake. This they have done by studying areas of the world with a high risk of earthquakes. So small earthquakes and tectonic plate movements, and swelling or tilting of the ground are some omens.","keyword":"[\"earthquake\", \"region\", \"occur\", \"fault\", \"plate\", \"wave\"]","ALS":"25.17241379310345"},{"english_id":"772","id":"773","level":"5","topic":"3","title":"Why do Locusts Swarm?","article":"Have you ever tried chasing a frisky grasshopper? If you have, you will definitely know that scampering after a jumpy bug is not an easy task. Most species of grasshoppers have a keen sense of hearing and the moment they sense trouble, they can hop fast and furious!Sometimes, shortage of food turns grasshoppers into migratory insects as they venture out in search of newer pastures. This situation happens when the species begins reproducing rapidly and does not have enough food for all the members of its community.When a normally non-migratory grasshopper becomes migratory, it changes its external form and becomes what is known as a locust.  For instance, a locust’s leg muscles are more powerful than our muscles and can propel the insect higher than ten times its own length. At the highest point of the jump, the insect begins to use its wings to move through air.In fact, true locusts are migratory short horned grasshoppers.  Normally, they are shy and prefer to be alone. But in a huge swarm, they become a menace and are capable of stripping a field in a matter of hours.Locust swarm eating everything in their pathWhy do locusts swarm?Until recently, little was known about why solitary grasshoppers change their behaviour when in company – grouping together to indulge in widespread mayhem. Now, zoologists at the University of Oxford, UK, say they have identified the biological mechanism that causes locusts to swarm.Headed by Stephen Simpson, the team has pointed out the sensitive hairs on the insects’ legs, which activate swarming. Incredible as it may sound, this discovery was made by tickling locusts under study, with a paintbrush! Tickling other parts of the locust, such as its antennae or back had no effect on behaviour.It is the tiny hair on the hind legs that get stimulated when the insects group together – turning the harmless insects into destructive pests. The scientists point out that the nervous system sends a message to the insects’ brain, which in turn triggers off a chemical reaction that results in swarming!The research team says that this discovery has great importance for it could finally lead to the production of insecticides capable of stopping vast swarms of locusts from wreaking havoc on crops.","keyword":"[\"locust\", \"grasshopper\", \"swarm\", \"migratory\", \"insect\", \"tickle\"]","ALS":"34.333333333333336"},{"english_id":"775","id":"776","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"Why do People Kiss Under the Mistletoe?","article":"In millions of homes in Europe and America, a sprig of mistletoe with berries is hung outside the doorway at Christmastime. According to custom, a man is allowed to kiss a girl if she is standing under the mistletoe.Why do People Kiss Under the Mistletoe?Legend has it that when Balder, the son of the Norse goddess Frigga was killed by an arrow made of mistletoe by Loki, an evil spirit, Frigga wept tears of white berries which brought him back to life. Overjoyed, Frigga blessed the plant and bestowed to kiss all who passed beneath it.From earliest times the mistletoe was regarded as a plant that increases life and fertility. However the Mistletoe themselves are are parasitic plants — they survive by attaching to the branches of a tree or shrub and absorbing water and nutrients from the host plant.The mistletoe is actually a parasitic plant. It can only grow if its seeds are left on branches or tree trunks. When the seeds sprout it sends a single root that ends up as a sucker (or sucking mechanism). It enters the host tree, mostly oak, and eventually may surround an entire branch.Birds eat mistletoe berries and the seeds stick to their beaks. When the birds rub their beaks the seeds fall on to other trees and the mistletoe sprouts again.The mistletoe was considered magical by the Celts, who lived hundreds of years ago in what is now Great Britain and France. The Celtic tribes (Britons, Gauls, Irish, Scots, etc) were nature worshippers. They worshipped over 300 gods and their priests were called druids.Many of their rituals were connected with the worship of trees and they believed that anything that that grew without its roots in the soil was mystical. They believed that the mistletoe was a gift from the gods for life and fertility and also guard against evil spirits. In the Celtic language mistletoe means ‘all-heal’.Why do People Kiss Under the Mistletoe?Since the druids considered the oak tree sacred, they would cut the mistletoe that grew on it with a golden sickle (remember Asterix comics and the druid Getafix?) and hang it over their doors. They believed that this would bring happiness to whoever enters the house and would protect the family from evil spirits.In ancient times it was customary for the visitor to kiss the hand of the host, signifying that the visitor has come in good faith. Since the mistletoe brings happiness, to kiss under it was a pledge of eternal friendship.Custom has it that a man who kisses a woman under the mistletoe would pluck a berry, until all the berries are plucked. When there are no berries left, the kissing should cease.Traditionally, if an unmarried girl is kissed under the mistletoe, the mistletoe is then burnt in the belief that the girl would get married.When the Romans conquered Britain and Gaul (now France), they brought with them new rituals and adopted some Celtic ones. With the spread of the new Christian religion throughout Europe and Britain came newer rituals but this did not make people forget their early customs.Hey, now, hold on! That doesn’t mean you lurk outside doorways waiting for just such an opportunity! Nor can you hold up a sprig of mistletoe over a girl’s head and kiss her. Instead of a buss on the cheek, you will probably get a sock on the mouth.

Some have names and are talked of with a sense of mystery, but many are nameless streams that flow through the nooks and crannies of the earth.In India, the River Saraswati is believed to flow underground and join the Ganga and the Yamuna at Allahabad. It was once an important tributary of the Indus, but now is lost in the sands of the Thar desert, in Rajasthan. Most devout Hindus would, however, claim that it continues to flow underground.What, after all, are these underground rivers?Underground rivers are really just flowing reservoirs of rainwater. This rainwater percolates down through the earth’s surface to collect at a level where solid rock prevents the water from going any deeper.As more and more rainwater percolates through, it increases the pressure on this trapped water. A slight crack, a small opening, is all that the water needs to push through and flow. Voila! You then have an underground river.The flow of water within rocks depends upon two properties: the rock’s porosity and permeability. Porosity is that part of a rock’s volume, which is made up of empty space or with vessels that allow liquids to flow through. Crystalline rocks have low porosity which is why water finds it difficult to go through. However, sedimentary rocks have high porosity, hence water cuts through easily.Permeability basically describes a substance that allows liquids and gases to flow through. Therefore, if underground water is surrounded by porous and permeable rocks, the water will push its way through easily.Underground water follows the steepest slope down. Limestone rocks are honeycombed with tunnels and cones. When rainwater – which contains a certain amount of acid – falls on them, an interesting process takes place. The water starts flowing through the tunnels and caves seeking a way out.As the water moves along, it wears away more and more of the surrounding rock to produce long tunnels, which eventually turn into underground rivers. These rivers finally reach the sea by surfacing at certain places.Underground rivers are also born when a powerful spring is unable to surface because of the solidity and compactness of the uppermost layer of rock. It simply redirects its energy and starts flowing underground, looking for an alternate way out.The distance travelled underground by such a river varies. In some cases it is more and in some others less. The famous Rhine of France travels only a short distance underground. The Saraswati travels completely underground, which is why many people doubt its existence.Some people have made it their life’s work to study such rivers. Speleologists – or scientists who study and explore caves – have tried to follow the course of some underground rivers but many passages are too narrow to get through. What they do then is to mix a dye in the water so that when it surfaces they can accurately identify where the underground river started, and where it finally surfaced.","keyword":"[\"underground\", \"river\", \"rock\", \"flow\", \"porosity\", \"rainwater\"]","ALS":"27.454545454545453"},{"english_id":"793","id":"794","level":"5","topic":"2","title":"Why doesn't our stomach get digested?","article":"All the food we eat goes into our stomach. Here, it is broken into smaller and simpler substances and get absorbed into the blood. Then, the blood carries these food particles to the different cells of the body, where they are used to provide energy to our body.Why doesn’t our stomach get digested?How is food broken into smaller particles?When we eat, the glands lining the walls of the stomach secrete a thin, strongly acidic, almost colorless liquid, called gastric juice. It contains two kinds of enzymes called pepsin and rennin that break down the food to simpler substances. These enzymes can function only in a highly acidic environment.That is why the gastric juices contain a very strong acid called hydrochloric acid. It is a colourless, or, faintly yellow, corrosive, and fuming liquid. The acid is so strong that it can corrode metal and burn almost anything that touches it.Though all humans carry this strong acid in their stomachs, surprisingly it does not harm them. This is because of the presence of a slimy, white liquid that flows out our noses. It is called mucus.It is a viscous mixture of mucins, water, electrolytes, epithelial cells, that form the inner lining of the skin, and leukocytes, which are white blood cells that fight disease. It is secreted by glands present on the surface of our nose and stomach.Mucins are glycoproteins which make any substance viscous and act as a lubricant.The mucus secreted by different parts of our bodies have special functions. In our nose, it serves as a lubricator and stops dirt and dust from going deep into the nose and also aids breathing. In our stomach, it forms a layer between the deadly gastric juices and the lining of the stomach walls. This mucus lining prevents the acid present in the gastric juices from damaging the stomach.This wall created by the mucus layer is called the mucus membrane. It behaves like an acid-proof glove that the stomach uses to save itself from getting burnt while using harmful acids.","keyword":"[\"stomach\", \"acid\", \"gastric\", \"mucus\", \"juice\", \"nose\"]","ALS":"27"},{"english_id":"797","id":"798","level":"5","topic":"14","title":"Why is a Hippopotamus called a River Horse?","article":"Among Africa’s unusual creatures is a barrel-shaped gigantic animal, the hippopotamus (plural hippopotami). The hippo is the third largest land animal after the elephant and the rhino. Slightly smaller but heavier than a white rhino, a hippo can weigh nearly 1,800 kg. The animal is huge and barrel shaped nearly 12 feet long and five feet at its shoulder, with a short thick neck and small ears.Hippos, or to use their biological name, hippopotamus amphibious literally means ‘river horse’. Recent DNA (a test for genes) has revealed that the hippo is more closely related to cetaceans (whales and dolphins) than to any other artiodactyls (even-toed hoofed mammal).Hippos are hoofed vegetarians, feeding on grass, fallen fruit, and occasionally on cultivated crops such as sugar cane or corn during the night.Hippos prefer rivers with deep water and nearby reed beds and grasslands, but are also found in salt-water areas near river mouths. They are well- adapted to stay in water and are excellent swimmers. Their ears and nostrils located at the top of the head – close automatically when the animal is under water.Why is a hippopotamus called a river horse?These animals prefer to stay in water through the day coming out only at night to forage for food. This search for food may take them five miles inland and so they liberally mark the path with their dung and urine to help them find their way back home before dawn.Adults may consume about 100 pounds of grass cutting the grass off with their broad lips and not with their teeth like most grazers.Hippo hide has practically no hair, and its smooth skin is quite delicate exuding a red, oily liquid that keeps the skin moist and protected when it is out of water. This has often led first-time explorers to arrive at the mistaken assumption that hippos sweat blood.Hippos have large tusk-like incisors and canines that grow continuously. These tusks are of ivory, and even more valuable than an elephant’s because they do not turn yellow with age. It is a fact that US President George Washington’s false teeth were carved from the tusks of a hippopotamus and not made of wood, as is commonly believed!A hippo has the widest jaws on any land mammal and when it opens its mouth to yawn the mouth measures two feet across! But despite its size and bulk, a hippopotamus can easily outrun a human.A hippo herd usually contains ten to fifteen animals consisting of a dominant male, a few subordinate males, and several females and their young.One calf is born at a time, after a gestation of around 230 days. Births usually occur in months of heavy rainfall, but can occur year-round. Young hippos will also bask on their mother’s back. Young males often form separate “bachelor” groups along the outskirts of the main herd.The hippo’s present-day range is confined to sub-Saharan Africa. In ancient times, hippos were found as far north as the Nile delta. In fact, images of the hippopotamus are fairly common in ancient Egyptian art. Today, its range is restricted to the lakes, rivers, and swamps of East and central Africa.Most claim that hippos are docile creatures while others maintain that hippos are aggressive, short-tempered beasts. Nearly all African explorers and hunters – Dr Livingston, Stanley, Burton, and Selous, etc – have had boating mishaps with hippos, though it is not known if they provoked the hippo.Hippos are also extremely protective of their young and there is no animal more dangerous than a hippo if you happen to come between it and their young.However, the hippo does give ample warning with an ear-splitting bellow like the roar of a lion and by opening its mouth in a huge yawn. The hippo’s yawn is not a sign of sleepiness or boredom but is actually a threatening gesture. A single bite can snap a small boat in half.Unfortunately the hippo is poached both for its ivory tusks and for its skin. Rawhide whips are made of its skin while the tusks fetch a hefty sum in the black market.","keyword":"[\"hippo\", \"hippopotamus\", \"tusk\", \"yawn\", \"river\", \"horse\"]","ALS":"34.5"},{"english_id":"799","id":"800","level":"5","topic":"5","title":"Why is the Ball-point Pen Called So?","article":"Writing is one of the most important inventions. Humans first used brushes for writing, then thick reeds were used. Feathers were used in medieval Europe for writing.In the mid-19 century, metallic pens and nibs were widely used, while the fountain pen was produced in 1884 by the American, LE Waterman. However, these pens had a lot of problems. The ink would spill and blot very frequently and writing was cumbersome.The first ball-point pen was invented by an Hungarian journalist, Ladislo Biro, in 1938. Biro had noticed that the type of ink used in newspaper printing dried quickly and did not smudge the paper. He decided to make a pen using the same type of ink. However, that thick ink could not flow through the normal pen nib, so he tried something else. And that is how the ball-point-pen was born.Why is the Ball-point Pen Called So?The anatomy of a ball-point penThe ball-point pen has a hollow body in which an ink-refill is inserted. The refill has a thick ink and so it doesn’t leak like a fountain pen. The part of the refill that writes has a tiny metallic ball, which is partially outside the refill body and partially in contact with the thick ink.It is to this ball that the ball-point pen owes its name.When the pen moves across the surface of a paper, the ball rotates. In the process, the side of the ball which is in contact with the ink touches the paper, leaving the ink mark. As the pen slides over the paper the ball keeps rotating, bringing the ink to the surface and enabling you to write.The World War II connectionDuring the second World War, the British Air Force used the ball-point pen. The air force needed a new type of pen one that would not leak at higher altitudes, as the fountain pen did when the plane was in the air. This lead to the popularity and widespread use of the ball-point pen.A ball-point-pen has several uses. As the ink is thick, it doesn’t require a blotting paper and nor does the writing smudge when water spills in the paper. The pen writes faster and and can write even on rough surfaces. However, the writer’s hand gets tired while writing with the ball-point-pen. This is because a greater amount of pressure is required to write with it.So the next time you pick up your ball-point pen to write, look closely at the tip. You will surely see the tiny ball which does all the wonder.","keyword":"[\"ball\", \"write\", \"paper\", \"fountain\", \"refill\", \"thick\"]","ALS":"23.4"},{"english_id":"800","id":"801","level":"5","topic":"19","title":"Why is the Bridge of Sighs so Called?","article":"The Bridge of Sighs (Ponte de Sospiri), is in Venice, Italy, and connects the inquisitor’s room in the east side of the Doge’s palace with the state’s prison or prigioni over the Rio de Palazzo.Work on the Doge’s palace (residence of the Duke) or Palazzo Ducale was begun in the 14th century and got its present shape only by the 16th century. The palace was not only the Doge’s residence and thus contained the inquisitor’s (judge) office, it also housed many other institutions like lawyers offices, the Chancellery, Naval Offices, etc.The Bridge of Sighs across the Rio di Palazzo is one of over 400 bridges across the 100 or so canals that connect the city of Venice. It was built by Antonio Contino in 1600.Why is the Bridge of Sighs (Ponte de Sospiri) so Called?The bridge became the path by which the prisoners were transported from the prison to the inquisitor’s office. Its name stems from the popular belief of sadness and the sighs of condemned prisoners as they were led through it to the executioner.However, it was only in the 19th century that it came to be called the ‘Bridge of Sighs’ after Lord Byron’s famous reference in his poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage “I stood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs, a palace and prison on each hand”.In reality, the days of inquisitions and torture were over by the time the bridge was built and only small time crooks were kept in the prison cells.The prison building is older than the Doge’s palace and was at one time used during the inquisition by the Church during the Middle Ages (when people were suspected of being witches or non believers and tortured).","keyword":"[\"bridge\", \"sigh\", \"prison\", \"palace\", \"doge\", \"inquisitor\"]","ALS":"83.5"},{"english_id":"802","id":"803","level":"5","topic":"0","title":"Why is the Mediterranean Sea Blue?","article":"We know that about seventy one per cent of the earth’s surface is covered with water. The earth’s three main Oceans are the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.The Atlantic Ocean is a great mass of water that separates Europe and Africa from America. It is shaped like a great hour-glass-with a ‘waist’ where Africa and South America bulge out towards each other. Although in area it is less than half the Pacific, it has many ‘secondary’ seas, such as the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.It is actually possible to distinguish where the waters of the Mediterranean Sea meet the Atlantic Ocean. This is because the former appears blue and the latter green.Why is this so?The Mediterranean Sea lies between southern Europe, Africa and south-west Asia. It is linked to the Atlantic Ocean through the narrow Strait of Gibraltar in the west and to the Black Sea in the north-east, via the sea of Marmara. The varying colours of the two depend mainly on the amount of sunlight scattered from their surface.The colour of the scattered light depends upon the substances dissolved in seawater. Generally, of the seven colours of sunlight, blue is scattered most. That is why most oceans appear blue. However, in the case of the Atlantic Ocean, the decaying plants on the ocean bed produce a green effect. When these plants decay, yellow pigments are released which get dissolved in the water. This water now scatters both blue and yellow light and the resulting mixture produces the characteristic greenish shade.","keyword":"[\"ocean\", \"mediterranean\", \"atlantic\", \"scatter\", \"blue\", \"africa\"]","ALS":"23.916666666666668"},{"english_id":"803","id":"804","level":"5","topic":"4","title":"Why was the Berlin Wall Built?","article":"A few tentative steps across Checkpoint Charlie and you were transported to a different world. One side had McDonalds, Coke, Toyota cars and a democratically elected government. Across the Checkpoint, was a world of state-owned factories, rows and rows of identical apartments, and a self-imposed government. This was the world of the two Berlins divided by barbed wire, watch dogs, tanks, and an imposing wall.In 1945, following World War II, Germany was divided into two countries – East Germany and West Germany. East Germany was controlled by the communist regime of the Soviet Union while West Germany became a democracy supported by the United States. Berlin, the former capital city, although entirely within East German borders, was also split into two.Why was the Berlin Wall Built? 360b \/ Shutterstock.comOn August 13, 1961, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) decided to block off East Berlin and West Berlin by means of a barbed wire. Streets were torn up, and barricades erected. Rail lines and the subway between East and West Berlin was torn up.People of East Berlin and the GDR were no longer allowed to enter West Berlin disrupting 60,000 commuters who were employed in West Berlin. Within the year, construction work began to build a solid wall separating the two cities.By September, people living near the border were forcibly evacuated from their houses. Citizens living in close proximity to the border had to register themselves with the police. Exactly a year after the division, an 18-year-old boy, Peter Fechter, of East Berlin, was shot down by the East Berlin border patrol when he attempted to escape over the wall.The border separating West Berlin and East Berlin had a total length of 166 km. It cut through 192 streets, 97 of them leading to East Berlin and 95 into the GDR. However since the border division was staggered, a solid 107 km long wall was erected. The wall was made up of concrete segments erected to a height of four metres (roughly 13 feet), with an additional concrete tube on top.On the side of East Berlin bright illumination lit up the entire area. Further a trench was dug to prevent vehicles from breaking through. Not content with these precautions, the area was patrolled day and night, with a separate corridor guarded by vicious guard dogs, watchtowers, and a second wall. If by chance some one did manage to cross these barriers, they were shot without a warning.Many families were separated by the erection of this barricade. Relatives who wanted to see their loved ones in East Berlin had to have a valid permit. For 28 years the Wall became a physical separator and cloaked the goings on behind Communist Russia and created a figurative Iron curtain.In 1989, after months of discussion, East Germany decided to tentatively open the barrier. On November 9, Günter Schabowski, leader of East Berlin’s communist party, stated that the border would be opened for ‘private trips abroad’.That day, the entire world watched some truly amazing scenes on TV as East Berliners poured through the checkpoints to be greeted by West Berliners. Champagne flowed and people danced on the wall at Brandenburg Gate, the gateway between the two cities.On November 10, demolition work on the wall began with the aim of creating new border crossings. Two days later, a checkpoint at the Potsdamer Platz was opened, and on December 22, a checkpoint for pedestrians was opened at the Brandenburg Gate. Souvenir hunters hammered out pieces of the wall and chunks of the wall were even sold.On July 1 1990, an economic, monetary and social union between East and West Germany was formed uniting the two cities. The only reminder of the wall is a red line painted on the pavement at the former ‘Checkpoint Charlie’ to mark the course of the former Berlin wall.In August 13 1998, a wall memorial was inaugurated at the Bernauer Strasse (former GDR) consisting of a portion of the Berlin wall.","keyword":"[\"berlin\", \"wall\", \"border\", \"checkpoint\", \"germany\", \"communist\"]","ALS":"29.56"},{"english_id":"804","id":"805","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"Why were the 1904 Olympics Such a Disaster?","article":"The 2000 Summer Olympics at Sydney were a millennium extravaganza unparalelled in the history of the Games. Techno-wizardry was at its best and the spectacular pageantry and the actual Games thrilled millions of viewers worldwide.Hosting the Games is big business. What the host country spends is trifling compared to the amount of money it receives by way of advertising revenue and tourist influx.Since 1896 when the modern Olympic Games were first held, the Games have undergone many upheavals. They were launched in 1896 to promote sports and test the sporting skills of humans in various categories. Over the years though, the true spirit has been lost as participating countries turn a blind eye to notions of honour and fair play. Instead, the focus is on winning either by hook or crook.The history of the Games is peppered with anecdotes of comedies of errors and the crookedness of the participants. In this respect the 1904 St. Louis Games were arguably the most disastrous Olympics ever.The St. Louis Games could hardly be called international games. The entire event lasted for only five days from Monday, August 29 to Saturday, September 3, 1904 with no events scheduled for Friday.Right form the start, they were different. The Olympics were not intended as competition between countries but as competition among amateur sportspersons, it was up to the athlete to travel to the Games at his own expense.Thus participants at the St. Louis Olympics consisted mainly of Americans and Canadians – of the 681 athletes, 525 were from the United States. Needless to say, the Games were farcical.Why were the 1904 St. Louis Olympics Such a Disaster? Solodov Alexey \/ Shutterstock.comTo start with, a separate category called ‘Anthropology Days’ was introduced. Minority communities and tribals had to compete in this separate category and were pitted against one another.The Anthropology Days of the 1904 Olympics were a ‘scientific experiment’ with participation from ‘costumed members of the uncivilized tribes’. This included Pygmies, Filipinos, various Native American tribes, including two South Africans, students at Orange Free State University, Len Tau and Jan Mashiani, who were billed as ‘Zulu savages’. Zulus belong to a tribe in Africa.These participants were to compete in such events such as mud fighting, rock throwing, greased-pole climbing and spear throwing. This was the white man’s way of showing that these people weren’t ‘civilized’ yet!The actual Olympics started with famous howlers such as Hungary’s Zoltan Halmay who won the 100m and 50m freestyle. Originally, Halmay beat American J. Scott Leary by a foot in the 50m event. However, the American judge ruled that Leary had won. This ruling resulted in a brawl and the judges ordered a rematch. Halmay won again.The other athletic event was the marathon. After the initial laps around the stadium, the runners embarked on a dusty, unpaved course. Leading the runners was a group of horsemen to clear the trail along the way. The horsemen were followed by doctors, judges, and reporters in motorcars. The result: the runners were literally forced to eat dust.The first man to cross the finish line was American Fred Lorz. When he entered the stadium, the crowd roared to support the local hero. However, his victory was short-lived as officials learned that Lorz had hitched a ride in an automobile. He was even seen waving to spectators and fellow runners along the way. Lorz was immediately banned for life from any future amateur competition.The second man in was a Britisher Thomas Hicks who ran for the American team. But Hicks victory too was short-lived as he collapsed halfway. His trainers had given him an oral dose of strychnine sulfate mixed with raw egg-white to keep him going. In the end, Hicks was actually supported by two of his trainers so that he could cross the finish line.However that’s not the end of the marathon story. The third colourful character in this race was a Cuban named Felix Carvajal. Felix wanted to run the marathon but he had no money. So he quit his job and decided to raise funds by running around the city square. Somehow he managed to raise enough to come to New Orleans.Unfortunately, Felix lost his money in a gambling game. He managed to hitchhike his way to St Louis. Carvajal lacked any type of running gear and so was dressed in long sleeves shirt and trousers. The officials were forced to postpone the start of the marathon for several minutes while he cut the sleeves off his shirt and the legs off his pants.During the race, Felix didn’t seem to fatigue easily. He clowned with the crowd and spectators all the way. But the long distance made him hungry and he took a detour and ate some green apples. This nearly cost Felix the race as he developed stomach cramps. Eventually, Felix got back in the race and managed to come in fourth place.Finally, the St. Louis Olympics came to an ignominious end. The Games were such a disaster that the Olympic Committee was forced to hold an interim Olympic games in 1906 at Athens, in an attempt to revive the prestige of the flagging Olympic movement.","keyword":"[\"olympics\", \"game\", \"felix\", \"louis\", \"olympic\", \"marathon\"]","ALS":"22.666666666666668"},{"english_id":"805","id":"806","level":"5","topic":"9","title":"Why's it hard for Ketchup to flow?","article":"Why is it so tough to get ketchup out of the bottle?When you overturn a sauce bottle that has been left untouched for some time, chances are, either the sauce will not come out at all or a gigantic blob will plop down on your plate. Getting ketchup to ‘flow’ out of the bottle can be quite an ordeal.However, if you shake the bottle before overturning it, the thick gooey ketchup will flow out more freely.Why does this happen?This strange property of changing from a gel like thickness (half liquid-half solid, like your toothpaste) to a free flowing liquid and back again is called thixotropy (pronounced thick-saw-tro-pea).The word has been derived from the Greek thixis, which means “the act of handling” and trope, meaning “change”. So a ketchup is a semi-liquid substance which changes on being handled.This happens because of the shape of the ketchup molecules. They are in the form of long chains. When the ketchup bottle is left untouched for some time, the molecule chains coil up together in a jumble.When the bottle is shaken, the molecules break apart and become loose. Hence, the ketchup starts flowing.You can even make your own thixotropic substance! For that, you need one cup of cold water and one and a half cups of cornstarch. Pour the water into a shallow dish. Add the cornstarch to the water slowly, one teaspoon of at a time, stirring all the while. Continue till you have exhausted all the cornstarch.Strike the surface of the water-cornstarch mixture with the back of a spoon. The mixture will not splatter like any other liquid. This is true for any thixotropic mixture.If you drop a small hard object, such as a tennis ball, on its surface, the mixture becomes firm and does not splash. This is because cornstarch and water molecules have fairly fixed positions. They cannot move freely under pressure and behave more like a solid. However, if there is no pressure, the mixture behaves like a liquid.Quicksand is also a thixotropic mixture, the more the pressure you apply the harder it gets to free yourself. The best way of getting out of quicksand is to apply force very slowly.","keyword":"[\"ketchup\", \"bottle\", \"mixture\", \"thixotropic\", \"cornstarch\", \"molecule\"]","ALS":"25.8125"},{"english_id":"1130","id":"1130","level":"5","topic":"8","title":"Sindbad and His Seven Voyages","article":"Long-long ago during the reign of Caliph Harun-Al-Rashid, there lived a poor porter in the city of Baghdad.
