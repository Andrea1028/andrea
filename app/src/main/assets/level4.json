This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. What it did was gain international favor from the world because of its ethical qualities. It put pressure on those countries doing business with the south to review their practices. It effectively put an end to the war. Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865 by a southern sympathizer as he sat in a theater with his wife.","keyword":"[\"lincoln\", \"slavery\", \"southern\", \"anger\", \"southerner\", \"promise\"]","ALS":"17.375"},{"english_id":"5","id":"6","level":"4","topic":"19","title":"Audie Murphy: An American War Hero","article":"After the war, he launched a successful Hollywood career.

One Hasselblad is still orbiting around the earth. It was dropped by an astronaut while on a space walk. Do you know that a few Hasselblads are also lying on the moon? They were left behind to save weight on the return trip from the moon.There’s something about the Hasselblad that makes news — almost as much as the events it shoots.It could be because it is one of the world’s most superior cameras. Photographs taken with a Hasselblad are of a very high quality. So the world’s most historic moments have been captured on the Hasselblad. And some ‘out-of-the-world’ moments too.The origin of this high-profile camera is as interesting as its experiences. To know how it originated, we have to go back in time to yet another historic moment.Celebrity Camera []It was the year 1939. Adolf Hitler’s Germany had just invaded Poland. Great Britain and France declared war on Germany. World War II had been sparked off. One day, a German Nazi plane was shot down for flying over Sweden. Although Sweden had not participated in the war, it was friendly with the Allies. And so, hostile to Germany. While digging into the wreckage of the aircraft, Swedish troops came across an aerial surveillance camera. It is a special kind of camera which enables a person to shoot pictures on the ground while being airborne. The crash of the German plane had not damaged the camera at all.Sweden needed such superior cameras to keep an eye on the movements of the Germans, who were hovering near Swedish territory after having invaded Sweden’s neighbours –Finland, Denmark and Norway. It turned to Victor Hasselblad, a well-known photographer, and asked him whether he could duplicate the camera.“I can make one better,” replied Hasselblad. He started work in a shed along with Ake Tranefors, a person who worked on machines. The result of their efforts was ready in 1940. The Hasselblad was born.The Hasselblad is world famous for being precise, sturdy and dependable. The first 240 cameras were made by hand. This was followed by a type called model Ska4 which had a square format. During the war, the Air Force Survey camera MK80 was produced. From 1948 to 1990, 22 new models were produced and in the 90s, 10 more new models appeared, according to a report in ‘The Deccan Herald’.But what about the man who gave the camera its name – Victor Hasselblad?He was born in 1906 to a wealthy business family. A shy boy, Victor took long hikes in the country and formed a great interest in birds. He took to photography in his early teens. Right from the first, he showed an interest in camera design. He studied camera and photography abroad. He had a special passion for bird photography. He wrote a book “Flyttfagelstrak” (The Migratory Bird Passages), which is read widely by bird lovers even today.During the years 1923 to 25, Victor worked in camera factories, learning all he could about various production aspects. When he returned to Sweden, he was well equipped with knowledge about his field. In 1933, he married Erna Nathhorst who was to back him fully on his project. He started the Victor Hasselblad AB, a camera manufacturing unit, in 1940. It has grown into a giant company today.Victor Hasselblad died in 1978. His legacy, the Hasselblad camera, lives on. And it still makes news.","keyword":"[\"hasselblad\", \"camera\", \"victor\", \"sweden\", \"photography\", \"german\"]","ALS":"17.146341463414632"},{"english_id":"210","id":"211","level":"4","topic":"7","title":"Champion of a 2300-year-old game","article":"It was a lazy summer afternoon, and the buffaloes had gone to sleep in the village pond, at Hassangarh, in Haryana. They had been given a vigorous rub by little Bhola and his gang of four, ranging from six to 10. All they wanted to do was doze.The creatures moved their ears slightly when the boys clambered onto their backs. Each one of them held a flower stamen as if he was holding a sword. But even during the fierce sword fight between the ‘warriors’, the animals did not stir.Tired of the game, the boys jumped to the shore. An idea struck Bhola and their eyes shone with pleasure. Down on their fours they went, looking for smoothened stones. And when they had collected a large treasure, they began their contest. Who could send the stones spinning over the water the farthest?I hung around curious to see who would be able to do it. It was my first visit to a friend’s village and I was determined not to miss out on anything.The biggest of the boys positioned himself with a smirk and looked around him, as if already expecting applause. Then he threw a stone with all his might.The stone rose high up and fell barely three metres ahead. The others rolled in the ground with glee. The participant retreated to the ‘stands’ (a green patch of grass) and suddenly discovered a pain in his shoulder.The others performed more or less like him and came back nursing shoulders that seemed to have come out of their sockets. Then it was Bhola’s turn. He was the youngest and the slimmest of them all. But he had a glint in his eye.He picked up a stone, held it flat in his fingers. Then he bent as low as possible and released the stone in a wide arc movement. The stone went spinning over the water. It even touched upon the small waves created by one of the buffaloes as she suddenly tossed around. The stone went beyond 10 metres.Bhola had become a hero. The others realised that he knew the right way to throw the stone, and that it did not need just brute strength.It was sheer coincidence that on my return I stumbled upon a book called The Mammoth Book of How It Happened, put together by a gentleman called Jon E Lewis, and published by Carroll & Graf Publishers, New York, 2000. In a fascinating manner, he has put together into one collection, eyewitness accounts of moments in history, both eventful and ordinary.And one such eyewitness account was of a game played by the children of Rome in 300 AD, about 2,300 years ago! The game they played was the one that Bhola and his friends, and children all over the world play to this day – ducks and drakes!The account was by a man called Minucius Felix who “saw a group of small boys vying with one another in a game of ducks and drakes.” How did he describe the game? “You choose a well-rounded shell from the shore – one that has been rubbed smooth by the pounding of the waves – and holding it horizontally in your fingers while stooping as low to the ground as you can get, you send it spinning across the water…”This happens because when the fast moving stone skims the surface of the water, the water behaves like a solid and bounces the stone off like a rubber ball.What should the stone do? According to Felix, it should either skim the surface of the sea or “shave the tops of the waves, only to resurface time and again”! Naturally, the boy whose stone went the longest distance and shaved the maximum wave tops was the winner!There are some things that never go out of fashion – and ducks and drakes seems to be one of them. Maybe I will tell Bhola about the children who played his game 2300 years ago. What will he say, I wonder…","keyword":"[\"stone\", \"bhola\", \"game\", \"duck\", \"wave\", \"spin\"]","ALS":"26.714285714285715"},{"english_id":"214","id":"215","level":"4","topic":"3","title":"Crafts kits for kids","article":"I live in a neighbourhood of Delhi which is full of children of all ages, shapes and sizes. In the evenings, the quiet of the place is shattered by the blood curdling cries of boys and girls let loose in the park. They play games that are certainly not for the fainthearted!Ishaan and Tarini are no different. This brother-sister pair is particularly mischievous. Eight year old Ishaan and 10-year-old Tarini are known for playing pranks on others. Placing chewing gum on a chair before someone sits on it is one example. Their idea of helping their mother in the kitchen is to put salt in the tea before offering it to a guest. Two months ago, they locked up their neighbour so they could climb his guava tree and raid as many fruits as possible. The list is long.But something happened to them two weeks ago. They woke up in the morning to find a big butterfly resting on the chord of the light bulb. It seemed all of nature’s colours had come to rest on the butterfly’s wings. The vermillion red of the setting sun, the shimmering yellow of the sunflower, flecks of green like a young blade of grass. Small dots of peacock blue. Ishaan and Tarini stood as if they had turned to stone. They had never seen anything so beautiful. Then, as if knowing it was being watched, the butterfly zoomed off.Both the children ran after it. They watched it zig-zag its way from one flower to another. They watched it flutter its wings in the air and then it disappeared. The butterfly’s colours made it possible for it to disappear in a garden that had flowers and leaves and trees of similar colours.Crafts kits for kids: Butterfly in the gardenThat evening both brother and sister did not go out to play. They kept talking to each other about the butterfly. Next morning they went out in the garden hoping to catch a glimpse of the beautiful creature. It was nowhere to be found. Suddenly they noticed that every flower and leaf had pearly dew drops on them. And then the sun rose in the horizon. A bright, blinding orb of orange and yellow. Ishaan and Tarini wondered how they could have missed such wonderful sights till now.During the drawing class that day, both Ishaan and Tarini sketched the butterfly in the garden. But somehow they found the colours did not have the brilliant shades of the butterfly or the sun, or the softness of the leaves and flowers in their garden. Back at home they tried to draw the garden again but felt it did not match up to what they had seen. They kept wondering how to get those very colours on paper.I knew how they felt. Many, many years ago, I too had fallen in love with nature. On a vacation to the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh I had seen hill after hill aflame with the palash tree, rightly called the flame of the forest. And on a visit to the hill station of Lansdowne, the sight of tender pink hedge roses had made me wonder how many colours existed in the world. Seeing my interest in nature my mother had bought a craft kit for me from a nearby shop. The kit consisted of coloured beads, threads, ribbons feathers and woodshavings. I had spent many satisfying afternoons making as many pictures of the sights I had seen. All I had to do was draw on paper and then stick the material in any colour combination I wanted. I knew Ishaan and Tarini would also love to have such a present.I did not have far to go. There was shop in the neighbourhood with a big banner across it – ‘Craft Kits for Kids’. I went right in and chose one of the biggest craft kits I could find.When Ishaan and Tarini opened their present their eyes widened in delight. ‘Look, didi, this bead has the same mix of colours we see in the morning sun,” Ishaan told Tarini excitedly. “Yes, and a mix of those threads will give us the butterfly’s colours if we plait them and stick them,” she said as happily.” My job was done.Next day I had a surprise visit. Ishaan and Tarini came in carrying a package. “Open it,” they said. I did so and found a breathtaking picture of a garden full of trees, flowers, a sun shining above and, you guessed it, a butterfly! “You see, each of the things we used has a different feel, and the same colour looks different in each material. We found every shade we wanted. Thank you,” they told me together.Now almost every house in our neighbourhood has been made sunny with a framed picture crafted by Ishaan and Tarini. Not only that, the neighbourhood shopkeeper now has a bigger banner across his shop – Craft Kits for Kids – meet a child artist every Sunday. Refreshments included.’ Isn’t that great?","keyword":"[\"ishaan\", \"tarini\", \"butterfly\", \"colour\", \"garden\", \"craft\"]","ALS":"19.122448979591837"},{"english_id":"217","id":"218","level":"4","topic":"1","title":"Don't Stop the Music, I Want to Dance","article":"Joseph Templin or Joe is an American teenager who loves to dance. He knows how to do a moonwalk, a swing, a twirl – all popular dance steps. The minute the music begins to flow, this lanky but handsome nineteen-year old, is all charged-up and itching to dance .Nothing is extraordinary about this except for one little fact. Joseph is profoundly deaf. Which means that he cannot hear a note of the music he dances to so beautifully.Still, something almost physical happens to him when music is played. He senses a change in the air’s energy when it comes. “The nothing is replaced by something,” Joe says to the LATWP Svc feature service, which wrote a report on him. The Times of India carried the report recently.It is this “something” that makes him such a good dancer. So good that he is all set to participate in a tough dance competition beginning late September, in Washington.Joe was a baby when he was struck by meningitis, a serious illness affecting children. The illness took his hearing. His poor family, living in Sao Paulo in Brazil, could not afford too many medications for him either. Then when he was three, Joe was adopted by an American couple, the Templins, and brought to Northern Virginia.Now, the Templins are an unusual family. They have adopted 11 of their 14 children, from countries as far away as Korea and Guatemala. The Templins believe that every one of their children is special. And that no handicap could hold a child back from doing what he wanted to. Joseph remembers the house ethos being simple: You will do everything that other kids do. Nothing can hold you back.Joe took this ethos to heart. As a child watching television, he liked to study the movements of dancers. Until one day he thought, I could try this myself. He started by mimicking the dance steps of pop star Michael Jackson. Followed by the dance-steps of other dancers. After a while he didn’t bother looking at the screen. He began to sense on his own what the next step would be.He obviously had that ‘something’, even then. That sixth sense which, coupled with nimble feet and good reflexes, makes him an absolute delight on the dance floor.None agrees with this more than Debra Sternberg, Joe’s dance partner. Debra, a dance instructor, was impressed by Joe’s natural flair and grace when she saw him dancing first. She hasn’t stopped being impressed. And that is why when the Virginia State Open swing dance competition was announced, she entered their names as partners.Joe is happy at this chance to display his dancing skills to a national audience. After the competition he intends to start going to college. He wants to take up a career in computer web design. Life is good, Joe feels. He only wishes that he can stop people from seeing him as the deaf boy who can dance. He only wants to be known as the boy who can dance.","keyword":"[\"templins\", \"joseph\", \"dancer\", \"competition\", \"music\", \"deaf\"]","ALS":"18"},{"english_id":"218","id":"219","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"Dress like an Egyptian","article":"I am writing this as I am travelling in my time machine. I know how important it is to keep a diary of happenings. The machine is making strange rattling noises, because I forgot to clean its aching joints this morning. It’s an old contraption, after all. Hullo! Where am I? I thought I was visiting ancient India, but this decidely looks like a pyramid. Oops! Looks like I have reached ancient Egypt. Never mind, as they say – enjoy!The clock in the time machine tells me that we have reached almost 7000 years back. We are walking down the street of Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt.A man with a belly, wearing a pleated skirt and a robe over it just passed by. He must be a wealthy man. So, even in ancient Egypt, it is pretty easy to make out who’s who and which part of society he or she belongs to. In contrast, see that man breaking stones, wearing a loin cloth.What’s this! Some women with elaborate hair-dos are wearing beaded dresses or pleated skirts with a long robe. They seem as if they belong to the upper class of Egyptian society.Dress like an EgyptianThe texture of their clothes is fine. It is linen, woven with yarn made from the flax plant. The higher up in society you go,the finer is the texture of the linen used – woven so finely that the cloth can even pass through a ring!The ones wearing plain short skirts are the slave girls. I don’t think I will be able to see the king and queen’s decorative ceremonial clothing, with feathers and sequins, as I have read somewhere. As they say, you can’t have everything.Their clothing style is chosen for comfort in the hot dry climate and children have a good way of keeping cool. They are running around naked to escape the heat in this blistering summer. The scorching sun is making me feel uncomfortable. I think I want to go back home now.Back from the pastI am back home safe and sound. No mistake this time. I have not landed in Mughal India, but in the power-less household of the 21st century. But there are a few facts I want to check. For instance, I want to know more about the women with elaborate hairstyles.Okay, so that’s it. My books and the Net tell me that just as for us today, hair was a major concern for the ancient Egyptians. Thousands of years ago, they were as anxious about thinning, balding and graying hair as we are today.Their paintings, specimens of combs, hairpins, wigs, and even poetry reveal their concern for hair today, gone tomorrow, and for looking good as per the standards of their times.Despite their obsession with thick and long hair, many men and women also preferred to shave their heads bald, replacing their natural hair with a wig. Wigs were popular amongst the upper and middle classes, the wealthier presumably maintaining a greater selection of wigs.Hair was also a popular place for ornaments and amulets; small fish, in particular, were attached to children’s hair, according to popular belief, for protection against the dangers of the river Nile.","keyword":"[\"hair\", \"skirt\", \"ancient\", \"wear\", \"egyptian\", \"texture\"]","ALS":"20.566666666666666"},{"english_id":"220","id":"221","level":"4","topic":"16","title":"From Heaven To Hell","article":"Kaz Suyeishi will never forget the quiet peace of the cloudless August morning in 1945. The 18-year-old was in the front garden of her home in Hiroshima. She was chatting with a friend, when a gleam of silver in the sky caught her attention. “It looked like an angel,” she said. “It was the most beautiful airplane. It looked like heaven and peace.”From Heaven To Hell.The plane was ‘Enola Gay’, dropping the world’s first atomic bomb, nicknamed ‘Little Boy’, over the Japanese city, on August 6. “That little bomb changed heaven to hell,” recalled Suyeishi. The flash of silver disappeared, replaced by a white spot in the blue sky. The sky changed to gray. Then red. Then black. The next thing Suyeishi remembers is regaining consciousness under a mound of wreckage that had been her neighbour’s house. She is above 70.The atomic bomb killed 2,00,000 of Hiroshima’s estimated population of 3,50,000. And 1,40,000 of Nagasaki’s estimated population of 2,70,000 population was killed by the atomic bombing of August 9.Suyeishi, who suffered radiation sickness after the bombing, was one of the lucky ones. She lived. She dedicated the rest of her life to spreading the message of peace. “You can’t see the scars here,” she pointed at her face. “But I am scarred in here,” she said, tapping her chest. “I don’t want anybody to go through what I went through. I never want it to happen again.”A musician, Ryan Oba, was moved by Suyeishi’s story and composed a song about her watching the bomb drop. He called it ‘Little Girl and Little Boy’. “I couldn’t get it out of my head,” Oba said. “She was expecting to see beauty, and it was the Enola Gay.”“The sky was clearer than clear it should be. The crew had unlimited visibility. As if the heavens wanted everyone to see how great the anger of a ‘Little Boy’ could be.I wonder why it’s here? Can’t you see it Mother, coming near?

Once ‘Bajai’ as she was called, told a different kind of a story – a real story of how the Gorkha warriors of Nepal came to settle down in Dehradun. Among them was Bajai’s grandfather, the chieftain of a clan.Bajai told us that more than 200 years ago, when the British East India Company ruled parts of India, they attacked Nepal. Bajai’s grandfather was the chieftain of a Gurung village called Gandrung. It lies at the foot of the fishtail mountain called Machapuchara. He and other chieftains from different parts of Nepal, joined under the command of General Amar Jung Thapa. They drove the British back. The British fled and the Nepalese army followed, conquering the whole of Kumaon and Garhwal hills.Unlike the well equipped British who had rifles and cannons, the Gorkhas fought with their traditional weapon, the khukuri. It is a knife with a short blade. But, unknown to most people, there is a cow hoof made at the base of the blade. One explanation for this could be that the Gorkhas are known as Gorakshaks or protectors of the cow. But the cow hoof at the bottom of the khukuri has another use as well. Because of it no blood ever falls or comes on to the handle of the weapon. The Gorkha’s grip remains strong as ever.It was with this weapon that the Gorkha army faced its opponents. The army consisted not just of men but women and children too. The whole family fought together.Having won Kumaon and the Garhwal hills, in northern India, the Gorkhas came to the valley of Dehra Dun (It now comes in the northern state of Uttaranchal). It was here, close to the natural springs of Sahastradhara (hundreds of natural springs) that they built a fort called Kalinga and ruled with an iron hand.The British still remembered their shameful defeat at the hands of the Gorkhas. They increased their numbers and surrounded the fort. But even then they could not find any way of causing harm to the Gorkha army.Finally, they found a way. They bribed a money lender with offers of land and income. He led them to the place from where the Gorkha army got its water.The British cut off all water supplies to the fort and starved the Gorkhas. On the fourth day, with not a drop of water to drink, the Gorkhas opened the gates of the fort and waited for the British troops. The first man, a British Major — was mowed down with a khukuri by a Gorkha woman carrying her baby in a sling on her back. By nightfall that day, not a single Gorkha adult survived. There were only a handful of children.The raw courage and fierce determination of the Gorkhas to fight in the face of all odds impressed the British. They were used to the easy submission of Indian kings. But for the Gorkhas, the traditional adage was “Kayar bhanda marnu ramro”- it’s better to die than to be a coward. They were determined to die than face capture.It was after this battle that the Treaty of Sagauli was signed, in 1816. The Gorkhas were recruited into the Army. The tales of valour was passed on from one generation to another.Bajai’s grandfather and grandmother did not survive the attack on the Kalinga fort. Bajai’s father was a young five-year old who grew up and joined the Army. He married a woman from the Kumaon hills. Bajai married when she was barely 15. Grandfather wasn’t rich but he loved the land of Johri. Every month, he put a little away and bought land with these savings. By the time he was a prisoner of war (POW) in Italy during the Second World War, in 1939, he owned nearly a hundred acres of forest, cultivated rice fields and gentle meadows with banana, mango and litchi trees.Bajai and Baaje (grandfather) had 13 children. Eight survived. They were determined to give their children the best. Baaje built a sloping tin-roofed house with his own hands. It had brown mud walls and floors, which Bajai loving washed with cow dung and mud every morning. Even in her bleakest hour when Baaje was a POW, Bajai insisted that the children go to school. She always insisted that we should pass at least 20 classes, which meant BA, MA everything. I do suspect she couldn’t count more than that…Baaje returned home alive, but with severe asthma. He died soon. Bajai never remarried, nor did she let her maternal relatives help a young widow and her seven children survive. Instead, she started tilling her land and growing her own foodgrains and vegetables. It was the same old Gorkha spirit at work.","keyword":"[\"gorkhas\", \"gorkha\", \"bajai\", \"british\", \"baaje\", \"grandfather\"]","ALS":"19.404255319148938"},{"english_id":"227","id":"228","level":"4","topic":"18","title":"Looking for sister in Hiroshima","article":"August 6, 1945. The day the United States of America dropped the atomic bomb on Hirsohima city, killing more than 200,000 people. A day after which the world has never been the same, for it proved that humans’ capacity to inflict suffering on fellow human beings was infinite. A day that hundreds of thousands of survivors try to make sense of to this day, by trying to remember what happened at each moment that day, before and after the bomb fell.They hope that after hearing the story of their lives, people would say no to war. Noriko Ueda, a victim of the atomic bomb and war survivor, too, remembers that day. She was 14 years old.Looking for sister in HiroshimaLike many senior students, Noriko was not at school. Instead, she was working at a printing shop, to help out in the country’s war effort. Students had filled up the factories. Her 12-year-old sister had been sent with other students to clear some place that had been bombed a few days ago.The children carried two bags with them now: one was the lunch box, and the other was a first-aid kit for burns and bleeding. They had been trained to help those who got hurt during bomb attacks. On the morning of August 6, Noriko went to attend a meeting in a school compound near the factory where she worked. At that time, the bomb was dropped. The school was about 1.5 kilometres away from the epicentre.Everything was orange, recalls Noriko. She couldn’t hear anything at all. That’s all she can remember. “…But different people saw different colours. For me, it was all orange. For some of my friends, it was purple. So the reaction to the radiation of the bombing was different from one person to the other,” remembers Noriko.Luckily, the 14-year-old didn’t have any burn or any external scar. The school building and the toilet had acted as shield for her. Then she realised that half the building had been completely destroyed. When she went back to the factory next to the school, it was in a shambles.It was a horrible scene. There were people buried under the machines crying for help. Nobody had the slightest idea that an atomic bomb had been dropped but they could feel that it had been a bomb of great magnitude.Noriko ran back to the school where there were shelters. Many people who lived in that neighbourhood escaped because they took refuge there. Near the shelters a man was heard shouting, “Don’t get in. Those who are injured should get in first. Those who survived, don’t get in. Let the injured ones be looked after first in the shelter.”Soon black rain began to fall. “We and the other school children had been told not to wear white shirts because we could be more easily identified as human beings by the American bombers. We dyed our clothes from white to grey. The grey coloured clothes turned into black because of the black rain. Afterwards, we found that that black rain had lots of radiation and could cause harmful effects to our bodies,” says Norika recalling that frightful event.Graveyard in japanThen the school teachers told them what to do. “Please, from now on we are going to evacuate. Please go there to that mountain with utmost care not to get missed.” As they all walked together under the guidance of school teachers, towards that mountain, they could see hundreds or thousands of severely burned and injured people.They reached the bank of Ohata river, but could not cross because it was high tide and the water level was high. So they started to use their first aid kits. “Let’s help these injured people for the sake of injured people and for the country,” they told each other. Noriko feels proud today that she helped the severely burned and injured.Her 12-year-old sister, who had had been dispatched to clear up places that had been bombed, had gone missing. She never returned. Almost 220 students had been involved in the job. Most of them are still unaccounted for. They vanished. There were only about 40 seventh graders in Noriko’s group which was giving emergency assistance to the injured.They were told not to give water to the injured, especially to those who had got burnt. Drinking water could lead to death. But still they wanted water. They went down to the river to have some water and they died. Some were washed away to the sea nearby.Near the mountain there were some trees. Under the trees’ shadow there were people lying down. One of them was a young lady. Her face wasn’t hurt but her back was severely burned and her clothes were completely burned. They thought she could be a teacher in charge of first year students. At first she didn’t answer. After a while, she opened her eyes and said she was with the children and had tried to bring them as far away from the bomb-affected area. She then smiled and passed away.Ten days later, Noriko’s family was still looking for her younger sister. Her father went to a place where the children had been working, and there, from under the rubble they were able to pull out some blackened uniforms. They bore the emblem of her sister’s school. In some pockets were sheets of paper, meant for exams. The uniforms were donated to the Hiroshima peace museum.Noriko hopes that the young never see a war in their lives. “I would hope that, as they enjoy their spring holidays in the Peace Park, they remember that in this area, some of my dear friends lived and vanished instantaneously.”Today, Noriko is 70 years old and in the last stages of her life. But, she hopes against hope that, one day, her sister will return.","keyword":"[\"noriko\", \"bomb\", \"student\", \"sister\", \"school\", \"injured\"]","ALS":"18.6"},{"english_id":"228","id":"229","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"Madhubani Magic of Gangadevi","article":"Aditi De of the ‘Women’s Feature Service’ writes about a meeting she had in the 1980s, with Gangadevi, the gifted painter of Mithila. Gangadevi is largely responsible for placing an ancient art, practiced for centuries by the women of her village, in the artistic map of the world.Face to face, Gangadevi, seemed shy at first glance. She drew the pallav (the border of the sari) of her brightly coloured cotton sari over her head, and pushed her black-rimmed spectacles firmly onto the bridge of her nose.Gangadevi had just returned to India after attending the Festival of India in the United States. Her mind was alive with all the strange scenes she had seen, the people she had met, and she needed to record all her experiences on paper. Gangadevi had just been honoured with a National Award for Crafts by the Indian government.Before our eyes, we watched America reborn through Gangadevi’s vision. She dipped her quill into a pot of black ink, and quickly put it to grainy, handmade paper. Black lines emerged as tall skyscrapers, with an upright rectangular shape within. What could it be? A lift, with a hat topped, shoe-clad man in it! Soon, we watched a long car, almost as long as the road whiz by. Women in knee-length skirts and men in checked shirts tucked into jeans, with young kids in tow, appeared on the scene through Gangadevi’s drawing.Gangadevi was born in the Mithila region of Bihar. She lived all her life in the region. What made her special was the unique gift she possessed – her magical fingers. Fingers, which drew absolutely spectacular line drawings of the myths and religious symbols of India.This gift is not unique to Gangadevi alone. For over three thousand years, women in the Mithila region have been painting such beautiful sketches.Maybe it has something to do with the historic value and beauty of Mithila. “Mithila,” Gangadevi revealed, “once stretched from the right bank of the Ganga to the foot of the Himalayas, one of the first kingdoms of eastern India. Both the Buddha and Mahavira, founders of Buddhism and Jainism respectively, were born in the Mithila region.”Most of the 30 million people who live in the Mithila region are farmers. The soil is fertile, and crops include wheat, rice, lentils and sugarcane. Early visitors loved its lush greenness so much that they called it Madhubani or the ‘forest of honey.’Gangadevi’s paintings too are referred to as Madhubani. Few things best portray the beauty, lushness and colour of the region, as her paintings.But why are women the painters here? It could be because Mithila is a matriarchal society, where daughters inherit the property from their mothers. The social conventions that bind girls in other parts of India from expressing themselves, do not apply here. Though poor, the girls of Mithila are encouraged to paint freely.Gangadevi remembers that her mother handed her first brush to her when she was still a child. It was a piece of rice straw and a few threads drawn from the hem of her sari. For ink, she used soot scraped from the bottom of a cooking pot, or from the chimney of a hurricane lantern.Like her cousin sisters and aunts, their mothers and grandmothers, Gangadevi learnt to mix the soot with cattle urine or gum arabic dissolved in water, or sometimes even goat’s milk. Since they didn’t have enough paper in the village, pages from her school notebook were often glued onto cloth to give her a large canvas to practice on.But usually, the women of Mithila painted on the walls of their homes, made of mud applied to a framework of branches. Their villages, some still without a school or electricity, often grew up around a pond. Whenever there was a wedding in the family or a celebration like Holi or Diwali, the women would draw a kohbar or ceremonial picture.“During a wedding,” , Gangadevi narrated, “first a kohbar drawing on paper would be sent to the boy as a proposal of marriage. Each gift of cloth, jewellery or spices exchanged between the families would be wrapped in a kohbar paper. “We painted leaves and trees, flowers, birds and auspicious fish on miniature huts of papier-mâché.” A Mithila painting done with prayer and art was said to attract the blessings of the gods into the house.Scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata appeared under the spell of the Mithila women’s fluent fingers. Traditionally, they were done on walls, on papier-mâché objects, or on sheets of paper. But today, because we in the cities demand it, Mithila paintings with their sweeping lines and bright colours, crop up on clothes at crafts bazaars, on greeting cards and pen-stands, something that the villagers of Mithila would never dream of using.Gangadevi is no more. She spent her last years battling cancer. Her last history is depicted in a room at the Crafts Museum in Delhi. Fine, exquisite lines sketch her visits to doctors, the stretcher she lay on, even the medical tests she underwent. None of these picture stories are like photographs – for they are all in the Mithila style that Gangadevi brought into our lives.Gangadevi lives on through the paintings she left behind for us. Like her, hundreds of women in Mithila continue to depict our myths and religious symbols through delicate lines and bright earthy colours. And maintain the continuity of tradition by handing down their art to another generation.","keyword":"[\"mithila\", \"gangadevi\", \"woman\", \"region\", \"paint\", \"kohbar\"]","ALS":"27.263157894736842"},{"english_id":"230","id":"231","level":"4","topic":"8","title":"Making Music","article":"This happened a long time ago. Hemavati sat in her kitchen after a meal. There was nothing much to do, and Hemavati was bored. So she picked up the thaali or plate in which she had eaten earlier and struck it with a ladle. Taaaaang, traaaaaang, traaaaang… it went. Funny sound, she thought. But then, she liked it too. It was better than many other sounds. For instance, it was better than the snoring sounds her husband made when he slept.Soon after, the thaali she had used to create the sound, began to be featured in many music pieces. Thus goes a grandma’s tale.People say that the origins of music and musical instruments are to be found in tools and activities. They had nothing to do with music initially.Folk-stringed instruments like the ‘tuntun’ (right) are nothing but animal traps made portable. At least that’s what many people say.The idea of making a harp (extreme right) started when someone noticed the twang made by a bow and arrow.Like Hemavati, there were others who transformed kitchen vessels into musical instruments.The tabla (bottom) or dagga were discovered when pots, pans and other containers used for storing, measuring and cooking grain, were covered with animal hide or skin. Imagine a row of such vessels.It couldn’t have taken long for some enterprising soul to learn that striking the vessels rhythmically could produce a certain string of sounds. And thus must have begun the world’s first drums.But the drum is not always used for music. The African talking drums convey messages over long distances through the pitch and intensity of their sounds.Similarly, the conch shell is one of the five basic musical instruments used in India. But, like the trumpet, the conch shell was also used to announce the beginning of a battle or the achievement of a victory.The pancha vadya, or five musical instruments comprise the sankh or conch shell (right), dholak or drum (bottom left), mohori or oboes (bottom centre) and kombu or horn (bottom right) and jhanj or cymbals.It is clear that humans have been quick to see different uses of an object throughout history. It connected the various activities of their life so very beautifully. Whether it is a school peon who pounds a thaali to signal the end of a period or class, or whether it is a hotel that plays music as people have their lunches or dinners, our ancestors have tried out these ideas long, long ago. But there’s no harm in our trying to come up with something novel, is there?","keyword":"[\"musical\", \"music\", \"instrument\", \"hemavati\", \"thaali\", \"conch\"]","ALS":"25.789473684210527"},{"english_id":"232","id":"233","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"Monsoon in Mumbai","article":"To the people of Mumbai, the thought of rain is as natural as breathing. And they think they are always prepared for it. As the temperature drops, and there is a slight nip in the air they cannot help thinking of piping hot pakoras and garam chai or hot tea.But the visitor often drops down from the sky unexpectedly. It has the power to disrupt the lives of the people. Like it did recently.The city of Mumbai had a parched or thirsty look. Then, all of a sudden, the scene changed. It rained for a full day! It was the worst downpour in the last 50 years in the month of May. Even the weather office was surprised by the happenings. The pre-monsoon showers had arrived earlier than expected. And what an arrival! There was water, water everywhere.Water seeped into vehicles. Scooters, cars and motorcycles came to a spluttering stop! Harassed Mumbai-ites had no choice but to wade in waist-high water, pushing their vehicles that had died a sudden death. At the first sign of rain, the tarpaulin covers were put on the roads that were being redone. The covers were no help. The roads still became a slushy bog.It is the responsibility of a city’s municipal corporation to keep the roads in shape, and to see that the sewers and drains are cleaned in time for the monsoon. That is the only way to prevent streets and houses from being flooded with water and rubbish.But, like the weather office, Mumbai’s municipal corporation also was caught napping. It had not cleaned all the storm water drains. As the water gushed through the drains, out came all the rubbish that collected in them. The streets became a wet dustbin.The railways tracks are the most important lifeline for the residents of Mumbai. But they were totally covered with water in several areas. Many trains got an unexpected holiday. They did not run that day. Since most people of Mumbai depend on trains for transport, they were left standing and waiting. And wet. Many others took advantage of this unexpected “off day” by spending the day in cyber cafes.As it was, the city was drowning in water. But there was more to come. As the Arabian Sea experienced high tide, more water entered the city’s drains and caused flooding in all low-lying areas!Ground floor residents at many suburbs faced an additional problem — floods in their drawing rooms! Stagnant water seeped into several sitting rooms.But in the midst of all this fury, many Mumbai-ites braved the storm to go the Gateway of India for a ringside view of the surging Arabian Sea. As the name suggests, you can see nothing but water till the distant horizon from there.Normally, there is a great deal of activity at the Gateway of India. Regular ferry cruises are a great favourite with children and adults alike. But that day the Gateway of India stood out, stark and splendid, against the backdrop of the stormy sky. The raging sea mirrored the clouds above — gray and menacing. Even as breakers or waves crashed against the rocks, soaking bystanders to the bone, few complained — they were too busy admiring Mother Nature at her stormy best.

He and his friends used to carve letters and numbers on cactus leaves after seeing their teacher do the same on small blackboards.He belongs to poor peasant family in Bambamarca in Peru. His family grows maize and potatoes in a place which is 12,000 feet above sea-level.But Leonardo wanted to see what a book looks like. So he asked the new priest in his parish to give him one. But there was no electricity in his village. So Leonardo borrowed candles from the church and sat up all night reading it. By dawn, he was at the door of the priest asking for another book to read.John Medcalf, the priest, was moved. He also realised that people would love to read if given a chance. But he knew how difficult it was for Leonardo and those in his village to get books.And yet, no one can be taught to read and write without books. To make people grow to love books, they have be with them. But, how could Medcalf make this possible in a poor, remote region like Bambamarca? As he writes in Index, a London-based magazine, there could be only one solution. By bringing books to people.But how could this be done? Mobile libraries or vehicles carrying books would be too expensive and difficult to maintain in the rough and rocky terrain of Peru. So what other method could be used to bring books to the peasant-reader? It had to be direct, easy and informal.Medcalf drew inspiration from the barefoot doctors of China. And that was how the barefoot librarians first appeared in the villages of northern Peru, almost thirty years ago.The librarians began by going from village to village, lending books to campesinos, which is what villagers in Peru are known. They helped start The Rural Library Network of Peru.At first, they were teachers of the village schools, to which these rural libraries were attached. But the teachers were not very interested in the job because it meant a lot of hard work. So, village elders took on the job themselves.Today, there are 600 village libraries across Peru under The Rural Library Network. The barefoot librarians who walk up to 15 hours a day with knapsacks are its lifeline. Some of them even ride on their pack animals carrying saddle-bags. Each bag contains about 24 books. A typical selection includes books on health and first-aid, poetry, legends, folk tales, and religious books.Children’s stories, read hungrily by both adults and kids, and books on law, are hot favourites.Every month, the librarians travel to the city of Cajamarca to exchange the books. They have become so important that now they have been given the responsibility of guarding their culture. Like protecting archaeological sites from trouble-makers. Lately, the librarians (and some readers) have taken to writing and publishing illustrated books themselves.Not all are happy with this state of affairs. The rich and powerful of Peru don’t like it that access to books is making the campesinos think. The government, too, is indifferent. But for the villagers, nothing could be more wonderful.Instruction books help them earn money. Books on agriculture, for example, are being used to learn bee keeping and other farming skills. Peasant families are no longer keen on migrating to cities. Story books keep them entertained. Law books teach them how to protect themselves from being used. Books are helping them discover opportunities which they have failed to see so far in their villages.And, Leonardo, the boy who inspired the library revolution, is today a village school-teacher. As much in love with books as ever. The barefoot librarians have ensured that he remain that way forever.","keyword":"[\"book\", \"peru\", \"library\", \"leonardo\", \"librarian\", \"barefoot\"]","ALS":"18.972972972972972"},{"english_id":"238","id":"239","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"Rabi, the Budding Poet","article":"When Rabindranath Tagore won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 for his poems in Gitanjali , he was the first Asian to be so honoured. We’ve seen pictures of him with his flowing grey beard and smiling eyes, clad in a long saffron robe. We know him as the man who founded the unusual gurukula or school at Shantiniketan in West Bengal in 1901.We also know that he’s the only poet whose verses have been chosen as the national anthems of two countries – India and Bangladesh.Rabindranath Tagore [Olga Popova \/ Shutterstock.com]What many of us don’t know is that many of his adult dreams were shaped by his childhood, his family and his schooling. Let’s flip a few pages backwards, and find out what he was like as a child named Rabi, for that’s what his family called him.Rabi was born on May 7, 1861. He was the second youngest of nine sons and six daughters of Debendranath Tagore and Sarada Devi.Debendranath – who was a rather saintly man – lived in the hill station of Dalhousie, in Uttar Pradesh, when Rabi was young. The child missed his Baba, who was so far away.When his younger brother died suddenly as an infant, Rabi found himself as the baby of the joint Tagore family, at their sprawling mansion at Jorasanko in Calcutta. Its inner courtyard could hold at least a thousand people, and often did, at social gatherings of the Tagores.Rabi was never alone, but constantly surrounded by cousins and nephews who wanted to play. His older sister’s son, Satya, was closest to him. The Tagore children faced a stream of tutors all day long, each with a cane in hand!The Jorasanko mansion must have seemed like an unexplored kingdom to little Rabi, who enjoyed playing alone, so that his imagination could soar. At five or six, he would choose a large room surrounded by verandahs with straight, tall railings, which he pretended were his pupils. He would imagine that he was teaching, and hit each railing with a cane very often!When Rabi did go to his first school, the Oriental Seminary in Calcutta in 1868, he hated it. If he didn’t do his lessons, he had to stand on a bench with his slate on his head. He got caned, too, especially for daydreaming. He spent all his time looking out of the window at the blue sky, the leaves on the trees or the bright flowers. Perhaps that’s what inspired Shantiniketan, where lessons were done under shady trees, without classrooms!Since all the Tagores spoke Bengali at home, they were puzzled when Rabi came home one day chanting his first words in English: Singel single melaling melaling! It was only when he grew older that Rabi figured out what the words really were: ‘Singing singing merrily merrily!’When he was 11, Debendranath asked Rabi if he’d like to travel to Dalhousie with him. Rabi jumped with joy at the idea. But Satya didn’t like the idea of his playmate going away. So, he told him terrible tales of how the train might toss Rabi out of the window or through the roof as it jerked along! Of course, Rabi arrived in Dalhousie safely despite his childish fears.In spite of the cold in Dalhousie, Rabi loved it there. After a cold bath every morning, Debendranath would teach him Sanskrit, which he loved for the rest of his life.To make young Rabi come to terms with figures, his father gave him money for the household and asked him to keep a daily account of it. But Rabi was so absentminded that his account book showed money left over every day, even when it had all been spent! Debendranath joked, “Rabi, I’ll give all my money to you. Then, it’ll never be spent!”Back in Calcutta, the Tagore home was constantly filled with music, theatre and other cultural activities. Rabi later wrote, “I do not remember a time when I could not sing.” No wonder his songs, or Rabindra Sangeet, later became so famous.Rabi was next sent to the Normal School. By this time, his older brothers came to be very proud of Rabi’s poetic way with words.When the principal of the school heard Rabi was a young poet, he made up two lines of poetry and asked the boy to complete the verse. Imagine his surprise when Rabi did, simply, and with ease!Rabi was 14 when he first read out one of his poems at the Hindu Mela in Calcutta. That’s when the world first heard the voice of Rabindranath Tagore, the poet who was proud to be an Indian.","keyword":"[\"rabi\", \"tagore\", \"debendranath\", \"dalhousie\", \"calcutta\", \"poet\"]","ALS":"32.07142857142857"},{"english_id":"239","id":"240","level":"4","topic":"9","title":"Rats!

[]The rat boom happened because of a new underground railway system. When work began on the railway system, workmen began digging the ground to make tunnels for the trains.

Diary – checked. I am writing my last lines before I take off in the time machine. Time machine – checked! This time it’s going to ancient Rome at the height of its empire. Only this morning I read somewhere that when in Rome, do as the Romans do. If you want to accompany me, sit in your seat, hold the mouse firmly, and whatever you do, don’t press the escape key on your keyboard.Whoosh!I have reached the Rome of about 1700 years ago (if you want to have the correct year, 1688 years ago). I have landed on a road called the Via Appia Antica. There’s great excitement in the air. It seems there is a big gladiator fight on at the Colosseum – that huge open air stadium built for gladiatorial sport, where people were seated according to their social class.That old man in the corner does not seem to be very bothered, though. He looks very relaxed. He is wearing a tunic with a large woollen cloth. It is not sewn or pinned, just draped carefully over the tunic (now I know from where Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan learnt to drape his shawl like that).Ancient roman man and womanThe old man tells me that it is called toga, and is considered the typical male dress of Rome. You can tell from a person’s toga as to how important or wealthy a person he is. An off-white toga with a broad purple border is associated with the upper classes. An off-white toga that is not dyed at all is worn by a commoner or plebian. That fashionable looking man has his hair longer than the others who seem to like their hair cut short.The women are wearing something more voluminous and woollen. It’s a long piece of cloth draped around their waist, with the excess material folded and pinned on both shoulders. Wealthy women use golden or silver brooches to fasten the cloth over their shoulders. I must say their hair styles are very elaborate. And their hair seems to be bleached.The old man says this is the basic garment for women, and is called doric peplos and has been worn by women since the beginning of the sixth century BC. Made from a rectangle of woven wool, it measures about six feet in width and about eighteen inches more than the height of the wearer – from shoulder to ankle in length.I don’t think I’m in the mood to watch a gladiatorial contest, so I am heading for home.Home again to books and the WebOkay, my research makes a lot of things clear. False hair, wigs, hair lotions and dyes were all known to the Romans. Much like today, many women had their hair bleached blonde. There was a flourishing trade in blonde hair to supply the demand for false hair. They had very complicated hair styles that their natural hair was not sufficient for.Even among men, while most of them tended to keep their hair short, the fashionable ones had a liking for hair curled with curling irons, and being pampered for hours at the barber’s’. But they were a small minority.This is incredible! The more I see of the past, the more I feel that trends keep going back and forth.

It made me feel very important because it was gifted to me in the year for which it had been printed. Until then the elders had always shoved at me, two or three-year-old diaries in which the listed holidays and Sundays made no sense. Naturally!It was a diary bound in dark brown leather and was printed by some company that must have been making a lot of money. And the first week of my life as a diary owner went by in a haze. I would keep looking at it, my heart swelling with pride. And then I would inhale the smell of fresh paper. It was heavenly.In the second week, I suddenly felt nervous. I had not written a single word in the diary. And now each page seemed to be looking at me in sorrow for the way it was being ignored. So I decided to keep an account of how I spent the day at school.I kept my promise to the diary. Every day after coming back from school, I would take out the diary, open the page dated for that day and write about what happened. But a strange thing happened – each page, instead of looking as if it came straight out of a famous writer’s book, looked dull and monotonous.The entries were almost identical: “Went to school. Had a class test. The English teacher had not come. Lunch was good – not mine but Atul’s. Have got homework for tomorrow.”The entries went on in a similar vein for the next six months.Imagine my surprise when I recently read a 4000-year-old account of a young boy’s day in school. It sounded almost the same! This boy was from Sumer that was part of the Mesopotamian civilisation (now in present-day Iraq).The Sumerians, as they were called, are responsible for a lot of things. They constructed the first cities. They invented writing and the idea that children must go to a place like school for education and instruction.Rrelief sculpture of ancient Assyrian warriorsWhat was the account of the boy’s day in school like? Well, almost like mine but 4000 years ago! Unbelievable! It went like this: “Arriving at school in the morning I recited my tablet, ate my lunch, prepared my new tablet, wrote it, finished it, then they assigned me my oral work…When school was dismissed, I went home…”They did not have paper books. Their writing was impressed on wet clay with a reed pen. The clay was baked hard in the sun. It was called a tablet. Their writing was called cuneiform. It consisted of wedge shaped symbols that made up words.I read this account in a book called, The Mammoth Book of How It Happened, by a gentleman called Jon E Lewis. In a fascinating manner, he has put together into one collection, eye-witness accounts of moments in history, both eventful and ordinary. Imagine, eye-witness accounts of almost 4000 years of history, though clearly, it is events of the western world that dominate the accounts by people of the west.Yet, the book told me that for schoolchildren anywhere in the world and probably, at any time in history, school has always meant the same.

Actually, not all of it was a pain. The car bounced up and down a few bumpy patches the first kilometer, then zoomed across a smooth 2.5 kilometre slope before struggling in a three-legged hurdle race at the final half kilometre. Reason: there was a traffic signal there and almost everyone in the world seemed to want to go somewhere at the same time. And exactly at the moment when our car inched towards the front, the lights would turn red again. It was a clear five minute wait there.And there was not a single happy face to be found at that traffic signal. After some time, I lost all pleasure even in the early part of the drive, because as soon as I sat in the car the traffic signals burst into life in my mind signalling – you guessed it – RED!Then one day something magical happened, and I can’t pretend that I was intelligent enough to think of it. The fact is my neck was a bit stiff that morning. In my dream the previous night I had battled weird guys with red traffic lights for eyes. So at the dreaded traffic signal, I moved my neck to and fro to ease the stiffness. As I moved my head to the left I saw it for the first time. Beyond the pavement a gulmohar tree with a vivid crown of bright red and orange blossoms in bunches. The small leaves were equally beautiful. I racked my head for expressions to describe them. Fern-like? Delicate like the filigree patterns jewellers make with gold or silver wires? Looking at the gulmohar the stiffness in my neck disappeared.In the light breeze the branches of the gulmohar were swaying. The leaves were rustling and shimmering, as if brimming with happiness. It seemed…yes…it seemed like the gulmohar was listening to some private music. The gulmohar was music conductor and listener at the same time. I was enchanted.Gulmohar (Delonix regia) is also know as Peacock Flower, Flame of the Forest, and Flame Tree.The gulmohar’s small neighbour was more sober. I recognised it as an Ashoka tree. It stood ramrod straight, at attention like a scout. The tapering leaves huddled close, forming a dense and conical crown. I could have been mistaken but I felt that the Ashoka did not have a private music collection of its own like the gulmohar. This tree liked to spend its time in serious thought. Living close to the gulmohar had not changed it. My gaze shifted to its neighbour.Now this one was a beauty in its own way. In the first week of May, the amaltas was going through its annual fancy dress. The branches were bare. Long, dark brown rods hung everywhere – these were pods of the previous year. In complete contrast to the bare look of the tree were these sunlight yellow clusters of flowers. Like long, soft feathers hanging from the branches. I felt like getting out of the car and rubbing the yellow blossoms gently across my face. The amaltas and gulmohar seemed to be friends. Rather, they seemed like two young girls, or boys if you will, planning a happy outing. The Ashoka looked like their parent or guardian content to be in its own world.Suddenly the trees seemed to be moving away from me. Had they set out on their outing already? Then I realised what it was. The traffic lights had turned green and we were on our way. For the first time I felt the traffic signal was not such a bad sort. It had got me new friends. Though I must take some credit for it too; after all I had used my eyes to really see something after a long time.

Her tales of jewelled ladies and brave warriors, of civilisations that ended due to famine, floods, war or volcanic eruptions, filled our young lives with fantasy.Nestling in the foothills of Mussoorie is a tiny village called Johri Gaun (Johri village) where we spent part of our summer and winter vacations every year. They were fun-filled days of sun-kissed air and raucous laughter, when we cousins met and had a great time. On our long walks we would nibble berries or catch colourful dragon flies, which we had nicknamed “helicopters”. I always collected red ones. If anyone caught a whirring red helicopter they would yell out for me and I would run and open my shoe box to put it in.By the time I really discovered Bajai, she was a very old woman, with countless wrinkles on her face. My mother was her youngest daughter. Bajai always wore white and smoked Batman cigarettes. I never got to meet Bajee (Grandfather). He was a prisoner of war in Italy, during the Second World War (1939-1945).He returned home alive but riddled with asthma, to which he succumbed. Bajai never remarried. Nor did she let her maternal relatives pitch in to help a young widow and her seven children survive. Instead, she started tilling her land and growing her own foodgrains and vegetablesNow, when I think of it, Bajai always smelt like the first shower on freshly tilled earth. Her hands were always calloused, but even in their roughness there was a gentleness she could not disguise.She always started her stories with a saying, “To the listener a garland of gold, to the story teller a garland of all forest flowers and this tale that I tell you today will be heard in heaven.”When she told her stories, we always crowded around her. Each one of us fought to be the closest to her as she took out a burning twig to light her filter-less cigarette. She would clear her throat looking at our eager faces. The kitchen fire would throw our dark shadows on the mud-washed walls. Our eagerly nodding heads would appear large and distorted in the lantern light.And so would start a magical journey of words creating images larger than life. Even now, 30 year later, I just need to close my eyes to get that smell of a wood fire and dung cakes and Bajai’s voice lilting as she imitated the sound of hooves on which the handsome prince rode…Looking back, I think Bajai loved telling us stories. Just when the hero or heroine was caught in a difficult situation, she would fumble for her cigarette. And all of us would jump to hand her a smoking twig to light her cigarette so that she could continue with her story. Whoever succeeded in handing her the twig laughed in sheer happiness.We would often fight amongst ourselves on whom Bajai loved the most. When we asked her she would laugh and say, I love you all. If we insisted, she would spin out a long story of how she would love us till the red necked parrot came home or the rains came home to make the tiny rice seedling grow big and strong. We would laugh loudly, jump up and down, stick out our tongues at each other or thumb our noses. In our hearts each of us felt that Bajai loved her or him the most.Bajai’s stories were so much a part of our lives that even her last day was like a story she had once told. It wasn’t yet dawn, when a sound woke me up. All of us slept in the attic, but no one else stirred. Everyone was sound asleep. I opened the window. There was a little rain and mist.

It was drawn by two white horses and a pretty woman in white was helping Bajai up the chariot.“Wait for me Bajai,” I yelled. Bajai looked up and smiled. She looked beautiful. There were no wrinkles on her face. Her gray hair was open and a few tendrils lifted in the wind. Bajai waved and smiled, and the soft wind carried her message.

I knew one such boy. His name was Tarun. I met him in the hill retreat of Shimla in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. I had gone there for a holiday some time ago.The Boy Who Could Do Nothing Right!For a nine-year-old Tarun was tall. Since he was much taller than his classmates, he would hunch his shoulders to appear smaller. His arms and legs were loose and he always seemed to have trouble walking straight. It seemed as if his arms and limbs were not ready to go along with the rest of the body. So much so that the joke in school was that no one knew whether Tarun was coming or going. On any given day there would be one or more bruises on his body from walking into table corners or closing the door on his hand. Prince of the Clumsy Kingdom was what everyone called him. Tarun was miserable.On a Sunday, unwilling to go out and face the teasing of the neighbourhood boys, Tarun sat at home flipping one television channel after another. As his hands tired of pressing a remote that had become very old, he stopped. It was a channel showing a bearded man in the dress of a sadhu doing unimaginable exercises. He lay down on his stomach and then, with his hands holding on to his ankles, lifted the upper part of his body as well as legs to form a boat shape. “This is the Dhanurasana, or the bow pose,” said the voice of the compere.Child performing yoga asanaThe bearded man had caught Tarun’s interest. He sat on the ground and tried to do the same. Wonder of wonders he could do it effortlessly. When his mother entered the room she almost dropped the tea cup in her hand in astonishment. Her clumsy boy and doing exercises that none of them could!Kid performing various yoga asanaThe news travelled like wildfire in the neighbourhood. The boys looked at Tarun with new respect. Old people came and ruffled his hair with affection. Tarun’s father took him to a yoga teacher so he could learn properly. Once the teacher got to know that for the first time in his life Tarun had found something he was good at, he was determined to help the boy.“My boy, what is it that you want to learn?” he asked Tarun.“I want to learn as much as is necessary for me to do what the other boys do – somersaults, jumps, even breakdance so that no one ever teases me again,” the boy replied.The teacher laughed and said, “Yoga for kids is what the sun is to the sunflower. It will make your body do things you could never dream of. It will sharpen your mind. It will make you see the whole world in a new light.”Now Tarun did not believe everything the teacher said. He was just hoping that yoga for kids could also cure him of his clumsiness and make him somersault like Jatin did. But as he started his yoga routine with his teacher, he felt himself changing.The teacher first made him do breathing exercises to energise his body. He said this was called Pranayama, exercises for the life force within each of us. Then he taught Tarun stretches, simple asanas or exercises like touching toes, bending sideways, twisting his spine, and finally, even the padmansana, the lotus pose. As his legs folded up and locked into the lotus pose, Tarun couldn’t believe his eyes. “Ma, Ma” he yelled. “Get a camera! See what I can do!” He could not contain his excitement.Within two months everyone was talking about the sea change in him. Tarun now walked straight, his stamina had increased, he felt confident enough to attempt anything and he could concentrate much better on studies.Best of all, no one called him the Prince of the Clumsy Kingdom any more.","keyword":"[\"tarun\", \"yoga\", \"exercise\", \"clumsy\", \"teacher\", \"pose\"]","ALS":"21.194444444444443"},{"english_id":"255","id":"256","level":"4","topic":"14","title":"The Earth Drum","article":"Imagine a pit covered with the skin of an ox. The hairy surface is on top and the hairy tail of the ox is still connected to the animal hide or skin. The cover is nailed to the ground at several places. And the ox tail becomes the drum stick. This is not a fantasy drum. It seems this was one of the earliest ways our ancestors in India made drums. It was called the bhoomi dundubhi or the earth drum.In countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, they made another kind of earth drum. They dug a deep hollow in the ground, covered it with planks on which women jumped in tune with the music.The Earth Drum []Our early ancestors had very clever ways of making drums. Sometimes, what they did was cut down a tree, and scoop out the wood inside. Just like the man at the ice cream shop takes out a scoop of ice cream from the container. The tree trunk became hollow. Then they covered it with animal skin, and hey presto! the forest came alive with the sound of the tree drum. The earliest drums probably stood like trees and were played on one side.If you want an idea of what the tree drum looked like, you must look at the standing drums from Andhra Pradesh. They are called the ronza and runza but are made of brass instead of wood. Some of the tree drums found in Africa and Mexico are as high as three metres! How do you think they are played?Wood drums are used even today. The kharram is played in Assam, the dhol is played in Andhra Pradesh. But these drums are not kept on the floor and are not so large.It is in Kerala that you may be able to see a descendant of the tree drum. Here coconut and palm trees are found in plenty. They are cut, made hollow from inside and then covered with leather.There was another kind of drum — the mud or clay drum. It not only looked like a mud vessel, it was a cooking and storing pot too! When our ancestors had to use them as drums, they would cover the vessels and start their rhythms.They even had the same words to describe the cooking vessel and the drum in several Dravidian languages.The words para, pare and pirai are used for drums as well as storage pots.The drums were made in familiar shapes — circular pots, shallow pans and long- necked jars. In India today, you can spot the pot-like dardura, the pan-like tasha and the jar shaped tumbaknari.Our ancestors liked mud because it was easier to make shapes out of it than out of wood. It was easier to use, but also easy to break. Though wood and clay drums continued to be made, in time, humans started making metal drums.","keyword":"[\"drum\", \"tree\", \"ancestor\", \"cover\", \"wood\", \"hollow\"]","ALS":"20.192307692307693"},{"english_id":"256","id":"257","level":"4","topic":"11","title":"The Emperor and the Zebra","article":"This is a tale almost 400 years old.

Akbar took a fancy to it and decided he must have it.Ibrahim Mirza, who was older than Akbar, was not in a mood to part with his toy. So he set a condition. He suggested a wrestling match. Whoever won would take the toy. The future emperor agreed at once. One doesn’t know if he gave any thought to the fact that his cousin was older and physically bigger than him. He rolled up his sleeves and prepared for the wrestling bout.The match began. And soon it became apparent that Ibrahim Mirza was no match for his younger cousin. Putting his hand behind Mirza’s waist, Akbar lifted his cousin up and then flung him on the ground. It was as clear a victory as could be. The kettle drum was his. And for the next few moments, he drummed away madly…Much later, when Akbar became emperor, the story of his life was written by his biographer Abul Fazl. And when Abul Fazl wrote about this incident, he wrote about in glowing terms! He saw the incident as a sign from the heavens that the child was a future emperor.

He sold cold drinks at a football stadium near his home in Thrissur, Kerala, to earn some money for his family. Today he is not only the captain of the Indian football team, he has started a coaching centre at the same football stadium. He wants to help youngsters like him who have dreams but very few ways of making them come true.The five feet ten inches tall Vijayan is one of the best goal scorers in Indian football today. He holds the record for the fastest goal in the world. He is the sole Indian player to have scored two international hat-tricks for India. The football player has been selected as India’s best player of the year three times.The good-natured Vijayan also has had a film made on him. No wonder he has become a larger than life hero in his home state of Kerala.Vijayan dreamt his first dreams in a thatched hut. Born on April 25, 1969, he comes from a very poor family in Thrissur. His father was a farm labourer who survived on daily wages. Vijayan did not wear shoes till the age of 12.As fate would have it, he lived very near the football stadium. On match days, he would sell cold drinks and earn some money for the family. But, in his spare time, the 12-year-old would play with an old ball in the company of the other boys who worked with him.Luckily for Vijayan, Kerala had a football scheme and he was enrolled in a three-year camp. It was at the camp that his talent developed.He was at the right time at the right place. Coaches of football teams trying to spot talented youngsters often came to the camp. In 1986-87, when the Kerala Police coaches came, they were impressed with Vijayan. They took him on. And now he had a regular income to take home.Vijayan played for the Kerala Police for four years. In 1991, the rich Calcutta football club, Mohun Bagan, picked him up. They paid him hundreds of thousands of rupees each year. Vijayan had become one of India’s top players. In the same year, Vijayan also played for India for the first time. He showed many skills: he could dribble and pass the ball at the right time. He could also pick up passes accurately. That is why he is seen as one of India’s all-time bests.From 1991 till 1998, Vijayan was taken on by one prestigious club after another. JCT Mills, Phagwara (Punjab), FC Kochin club (Kerala) and Mohun Bagan were some of them. At one stage, he was earning almost Rs. 4 million ($93,023) per year. He returned to his home state Kerala last year.Vijayan, who is planning to retire soon, has started a football academy in the city of Thrissur, where he was born. He has another dream now: to give back something to the game that has brought him success and happiness. He plans to coach youngsters. Who knows, he may just succeed in making the dreams of some boy come true.

But he filled those years so totally with 626 musical works that the world today recognises him as one of the greatest composers ever. Among his works were 50 symphonies and 19 operas, including much-loved works like The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute.Mozart was born in the Austrian city of Salzburg, known for its salt mines, in 1756. His father, Leopold, was the choirmaster to the Archbishop of Salzburg.It was while Leopold was giving lessons to his older daughter Maria Anna that he noticed that little Nannerl, as the family called Mozart, was totally enchanted by the music. By the age of five, he could play long pieces without a flaw and even create his own shorter compositions.A letter from the Salzburg court trumpeter to Maria Anna in April 1972 recalls this scene. Leopold, on his return from a church service, found four-year-old Mozart very busy with a pen.“What are you doing?” asked Leopold.“Writing a concerto for the clavier (an early keyboard musical instrument). It will be done soon,” replied Mozart.“Let me see it,” said Leopold.Mozart responded: “It’s not finished yet.”When Leopold picked up the sheet of paper, he found a scribble of musical notes, most of them covered with inkblots. That’s because Mozart dipped his pen to the bottom of the inkwell every time he needed to, so that inkblots fell on the paper each time. But the boy wiped his palm over it and kept writing, so keen was he on completing the concerto.After he’d read the piece through, Leopold noted that it was so difficult that no one in the world could play it.But Mozart said, “That is why it is a concerto. It must be practised till it is perfect.” And then the little one began to show his father how to play it!In 1792, Leopold took Mozart to the court in Vienna, the Austrian capital, to play. This was the first stop of a tour that took them around the courts of Europe for the next three-and-a-half years. Soon, Mozart was the most famous child prodigy in Europe.When he played, Mozart’s delicate face was dead serious. But during concert breaks, he behaved just as a child of his age probably would. He was even seen running around a royal court with a stick between his legs, pretending that it was a horse!In Europe, city after city sang the praises of the young Mozart. At Bologna in Italy, he was made a member of the famous Philharmonic Academy – though officially only those over 20 could be admitted. In Rome, Pope Clement XIV decorated him with the Order of the Golden Spur. At Milan, he wrote his first opera, Mithridates, which was composed so quickly that Mozart’s tender fingers hurt!But what was Mozart like at home? When he was about eight, Leopold fell ill with a bad throat ailment in London. The children were forbidden to make a noise, even to play a piano, until he was better. To keep his itching fingers busy, Mozart used music in a different way. He composed his first symphony – K 16 – for an entire orchestra!Until he was about ten, Nannerl hated the sound of the horn. When it was played solo, he shuddered. Leopold wanted to cure his son of this fear, so he asked Maria Anna to blow a horn towards Mozart. But he turned pale at the very sound and would have fainted, had she not stopped at once. Luckily, she did.On one occasion, two archduchesses were leading little Mozart up to the Austrian empress. He slipped and fell because the floor of the court chamber was very slippery due to polish. One of the duchesses, Marie Antoinette – who later became the queen of France – lifted the boy up and consoled him. In response, Mozart wiped his tears away and said to her, “You are very kind. I will marry you.”Later, her mother asked Mozart what made him say these words. He said, rather solemnly, “From gratitude. She was so good, but her sister wasn’t concerned about my fall in the least.”Today, all of Salzburg seems like Mozart’s town. Its dramatic cupolas and spires seem to call out his name. The house where he was born is now a famous museum, a shrine for music lovers. The city even hosts a Mozart Week every year, when the master composer’s works are played.Mozart started young in the world of music. But his first notes of promise still ring true in our ears.","keyword":"[\"mozart\", \"leopold\", \"court\", \"austrian\", \"salzburg\", \"anna\"]","ALS":"25.542857142857144"},{"english_id":"262","id":"263","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"The Greek Barber","article":"I wonder what others think of when they hear a mention of Greece.

Others prefer stickers, posters, tattoos or coins. But Pinky Bhutia is different. She collects children. In her mountain village, in Sikkim, she is known as the wonderful young woman who adopts all the children she can.Pinky was 14 when she adopted her first child, a Nepali orphan. Today, she has a dozen adopted children, and two sons from her marriage.The Woman who Collects Children []Plump, pink-cheeked Pinky is about 30 years old and she comes from an ordinary family. If you passed her on the street, you wouldn’t give her a second look. She lives in a brown mud-washed house which has a tin roof in Rhenock village. There is a vegetable patch outside. Red hens with noisy chicks run all over the garden looking for worms.If you ask her why she provides a home to so many kids, she smiles. A shy smile which becomes as warm as an afternoon sun. But her eyes are serious. “I know what it is to be poor and hungry.” As a child, her only dream was to eat a full meal of khole (a gruel of maize), and her favourite pastime was watching people with shoes and imagining what it felt like. By adopting poor and homeless children she is making sure that they never feel that helpless.Some of her adopted children are orphans. Some stay with her, because they come from very poor families. And some of her adopted children stay with their parents but receive full support from Pinky.Pinky feels very proud when she sees her children happy and bright. Her oldest baby, Sarita Rai, is now a bright 20 year old. Then, there is 19-year-old Nimbhe who came to Pinky because her mother was unable to look after her. She started work in a government office in Sikkim’s capital Gangtok, two years ago. Ten-year-old Bhim and 14-year-old Kumar came to Pinky five years ago, after their father’s death. They started living on a patch of land given by Pinky and grew vegetables for sale.The fair and quiet Pemkit Lepcha was in class two when she came to the family. She is now in class eight. San Bahadur Chhetri’s parents couldn’t afford to keep him in school, though he was a bright student. Bhutia said she would take care of him. San Bahadur finished his board exams two years ago. Though he lived with his own parents, he taught all the young children in the Bhutia family. Lamu Bhutia was three when Pinky saw him with his parents who worked as labourers. Pinky brought him home and put him in school. He visited his parents from time to time.Talking about her children, Pinky remembers her own childhood. She grew up in a large family of 25 cousins, aunts and uncles. There were 15 schoolgoing children. They would eat a cob of maize or a phaphar (maize) roti, depending on the season, and go barefoot to school. The next meal was only at 4 pm.Pinky’s father was a road construction worker with a very small salary. At the age of 11, Pinky started working during school breaks. For eight hours, she would sweep the roads in front of the road-roller. Her brothers were studying then. The whole family hoped they would become big government officials and the family would not have to suffer any longer.Pinky was 14 and in class eight when she took home her first “daughter” — a weak Nepali baby girl, Sarita Rai. Pinky’s parents did not mind. Pinky left school and started working full-time because she had a baby to feed. She helped build roads and army barracks. Today, baby Sarita is a bright 20-year-old.At the age of 14, Pinky’s parents got her married. Despite having her own children, she adopted nearly a dozen more. Her husband Lapka does not mind. “I like children.

And perhaps your parents and their parents before them too.According to the company, that makes it, over 275 million games have been sold in 111 countries. Over the last eight odd years over one billion people have traded make-believe real estate with fake money.If you guessed Monopoly, you would be right. Just in case you have not played this board game, a quick explanation is in order. At the start of the game all the players are allocated some fake cash. From there on every player gets to roll the dice to move around the board. When they land on a property on the board they can buy it if it is not already owned. But if it is already owned by another player they have to pay rent to the owner. The more properties you own the more rent you collect. The aim of the game is to own and control of the entire economy. The game ends when the ‘monopolist’ own everything and all other players are driven into bankruptcy.Over the years this game has come to be seen by many adults as a good game to ‘teach’ children financial literacy. It not only helps children understand how the world of money operates, but also ’teaches’ them skills to negotiate and make tough decisions — essential life skills, in today’s competitive world.What might surprise you though is that before this game was called ‘Monopoly’, it was called ‘The Landlord’s Game’. The game designer Elizabeth Magie had almost the opposite vision of what the game has now come to be. She wanted to use the game to teach the dangers of cutthroat capitalism. During the Great Depression (a time of great financial hardship during the 1920s) this game was used as a tool to teach tenants how landlords were ripping them off.The original creators’ vision was corrupted and a game designed to teach the pitfalls of hyper competitiveness that leaves opponents is economic ruin is now seen as one that teaches financial literacy.But, you might say, it is just a game. Perhaps. While the jury is still out on how games effect children, it is generally agreed that games that have explicit violence require ‘Parental Guidance’. Perhaps Monopoly should be PG13 too.Meanwhile, perhaps when you play this game next, you will think twice before ruthlessly bankrupting your best friend. Or your sibling.First page of patent submission for first version of Lizzie Magie’s board game, granted on January 5, 1904.

The exhibit was an experience for people with normal sight, as they were made to grope through pitch dark tunnels, along with blind people.Spielmann converted an unused church into a 60-seat restaurant. The Blind Cow is decorated with stained glass windows. The reception is dimly lit with a spotlight over the heavy doors. Black curtains make the sitting area pitch dark and there are no lights.Customers who can see, value their experience at the Blind Cow as it enables them to “see” a new dimension to the world, through the eyes of people with no sight but a great deal of vision.There are other reasons why people like going to the restaurant. As no one can see what the others are doing, table manners are temporarily forgotten.

Since there are only two options and three people, once the votes are counted, there would be a winner. This is an example of democracy at work.More specifically, it is an example of what is called a direct democracy. This is a democracy where the voters have a direct say in the decisions made by the group. Imagine if the entire school of 3000 kids had to choose between pizza and burgers. That would be very hard. One way out would be for each class to choose a representative who could then vote on behalf of the entire class. This would be an example of representative democracy.Similarly, entire countries can also make decisions in this way. People could vote directly for every decision or elect representatives who vote on their behalf. The first would be called direct democracy and the second would be a representative democracy.Although no country has a completely direct democracy, Switzerland asks its citizens to vote on a variety of issues. For a large country, this would be impossible to do. For example, India, the world’s largest democracy, and the United States, the world’s oldest democracy are both examples of representative democracy. In representative democracies, the representatives make decisions on behalf of the public who voted for them.Democracy is a way of deciding things that are fair to the members making the decision. It is a concept that is simple when there are only three people involved. Yet it can be used to make decisions for a country with nearly one and a half billion people.Over the years the idea of a democracy has evolved yet the central principle remains the same. Everyone gets a voice in the way their country is run. The process to do this remains the same across small towns and states, to entire countries. Citizens stand for elections and if they win, they have a say in how the country is run.Democracy is a way of managing decision-making so that everyone has a say in the matter. It works on every level, from choosing something to eat to choosing what we do as a country.Unfortunately, until recently, democracy wasn’t for everyone. Till just 100 years ago, women weren’t allowed to vote in the United States, but slowly it expanded to include everyone in most established democracies. Today, out of the 193 countries in the United Nations, 167 of them are democracies (See image below).The Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index map for 2019 [Data Source: Economist Intelligence Unit]","keyword":"[\"democracy\", \"vote\", \"representative\", \"decision\", \"direct\", \"behalf\"]","ALS":"23.714285714285715"},{"english_id":"281","id":"282","level":"4","topic":"19","title":"When Grandma challenged British Rule","article":"Whenever I go to my ancestral home in Nainital, I never forget to brush my hand across an engraved name-plate and feel the name on it. The name belongs to my great grandfather who used to work for the British Empire. For his loyalty, he was rewarded with the title of ‘Rai Saheb’.Having worked with the British for years, Rai Saheb gained in wealth and name. And everyone in the household feared him. Well, not exactly. There was one person who dared to defy him: my grandmother. She was his first-born and his favourite.When she was 15, grandmother happened to listen to a public speech by a leader of the Indian National Congress. The fiery speech made a deep impact on her mind. From that moment, she was resolutely drawn to Mahatma Gandhi’s principle ofSatyagraha as the way to freedom from foreign rule.Needless to say, her father never agreed with her. He believed that only the British could run the country. To show his loyalty, he had even placed the British flag atop his house. Grandmother couldn’t stand the flag but didn’t have the courage to act against her father.Mahatma Gandhi leading the dandi marchIn those days, Nainital was in the grip of the freedom movement. There were rallies as well as secret meetings. The scenic hill station on the foothills of the Himalayas was hotting up. There was talk of none other than Mahatma Gandhi coming to Nainital for a conference. And people started making preparations to welcome Gandhiji in their small town.Children made small tri-coloured flags and small posters saying, “Britishers, leave India.” Grandma was no different. She too prepared an Indian flag for her house. But well aware of her father’s anger, she kept it a hush-hush affair. Nobody knew about it, except her sister.Finally, the day of Gandhiji’s arrival dawned. Without caring for the reaction of the British administration, people hoisted flags of the Indian National Congress (INC) on their rooftops to welcome Gandhiji to Nainital. Grandmother too, awaited the perfect moment to commit her deed. As soon as her father left for work, she scampered up the stairs, threw the British flag on the ground and hoisted the flag made by her in its place.As the flag unfurled in the air, she felt a surge of excitement run through her veins. But an Indian flag on top of Rai Saheb’s house was unthinkable. Someone happened to see it and passed the information to Rai Saheb. He stormed into the house, much like an angry bull.The first thing he did was to throw the INC flag aside and replace it with the British flag. And then he proceeded to punish grandmother. It was a severe punishment indeed for a teenager. She was beaten by her father with a local itching plant that causes terrible rashes on the skin and then locked up inside a room. But when Grandma was finally let out of the “chamber of horrors” she had a smile on her face.She had made her point.","keyword":"[\"flag\", \"british\", \"nainital\", \"grandmother\", \"saheb\", \"gandhiji\"]","ALS":"19.75862068965517"},{"english_id":"287","id":"288","level":"4","topic":"9","title":"Anzac Day","article":"ANZAC Day (April 25) is when Australia and New Zealand honour members of their World War I soldiers.

Another good one was the “left-handed burger” advertised by Burger King on April 1st, 1998. They said all of the juice would drip out of the right hand side of the burger. Many customers asked the Burger King staff for the traditional right-handed burger.

It is the start of a religious period that leads up to Palm Sunday and the Easter holidays. On Ash Wednesday, people traditionally start fasting for 40 days, eating only simple food. The 40 days is because Jesus fasted in the wilderness for a similar period of time. Roman Catholics should only eat one full meal and two smaller ones during this time. Many Catholics will fast completely on Ash Wednesday or just have bread and water. It is one of only two days in the Catholic calendar when fasting is required. The other day is Good Friday. Ash Wednesday falls between February the 4th and March the 10th each year, depending on the date of Easter.\n\nIt is called Ash Wednesday because priests draw a small cross on the foreheads of people in church. The cross is a sign that you have regretted your sins and want to cleanse your soul. It is tradition to keep the cross on one’s forehead until the sun sets. In other churches, people write their sins on a small piece of paper, which is then burnt and turned into ash. In Biblical times, people covered themselves in ash to express their sorrow for their sins. Priests say a prayer to show we are all mortal and will return to ashes after we die. A traditional prayer is: “God our Father, you create us from the dust of the earth. Grant that these ashes may be for us a sign of our sins, and a symbol of our mortality.”","keyword":"[\"wednesday\", \"catholic\", \"fast\", \"forehead\", \"easter\", \"priest\"]","ALS":"17.705882352941178"},{"english_id":"291","id":"292","level":"4","topic":"12","title":"Aviation Day","article":"Aviation Day is on August the 19th.

President Franklin Roosevelt decided the anniversary of Orville Wright's birthday should be National Aviation Day in the U.S.A. Wright was one of the brothers who made the first ever flight. President Roosevelt invited “the people of the United States to observe National Aviation Day with appropriate exercises to further stimulate interest in aviation”. Today, this means educational workshops in schools learning about the history of aviation. It is also a good time for airlines to try and get students interested in a career in aviation, either as a pilot or a member of the ground crew.\n\nOrville Wright piloted the world’s first airplane, the Wright Flyer. He and his brother Wilbur built an airplane with controls that enabled them to steer. Orville’s historic flight took place on December the 17th, 1903. The flight lasted just 12 seconds. In that short time, he flew a total of 120 feet, 40 metres. The Wright brothers were bicycle engineers who believed man could fly. They believed the secret to what was called “the flying problem” was not more powerful engines, but better aerodynamics. They knew that if a bicycle could remain upright while moving forwards, an airplane could fly in a straight line. Their wing and propeller design changed the world forever.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"aviation\", \"wright\", \"orville\", \"flight\", \"airplane\", \"brother\"]","ALS":"16.352941176470587"},{"english_id":"293","id":"294","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"Be Positive - Do Something Day","article":"Be Positive  Do Something Day is on March 1st.

He published a book on his findings, “On the Origin of the Species”, which is accepted by most scientists as the theory of evolution. It is still the foundation of biology and provides a logical explanation for the diversity of life on Earth.

It is a day when we can think about our breath and how it affects our life and relationships. Bad breath is one of life’s most personal problems. It can make or break a romantic relationship and have an impact on how you do business. Indeed, it can be so personal that even our best friend will not tell us we have bad breath. Would you tell someone that they had smelly breath? On Fresh Breath Day, read up on how you can make sure you have fresh-smelling breath. For many people it’s a simple case of good dental hygiene habits and a healthy lifestyle. Drinking too much alcohol, smoking cigarettes and not brushing your teeth regularly will all make your breath smell.\n\nAround 25 per cent of the population has chronic bad breath, often called halitosis. The older we become, the more likely we are to have it. Bad breath is caused by as many as 600 different types of bacteria. These are found on the gums, cheeks and tongue. Many of us try to hide bad breath with things like mouthwash and breath sprays. These are only short-term solutions. Fresh breath comes from keeping your mouth healthy. This means regular dental check-ups to have your teeth cleaned, flossing, and using a water-jet cleaner every day to remove food stuck between your teeth or under your gums. You also need to scrape your tongue every day. Fifty per cent of bacteria is found on the tongue.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"breath\", \"tongue\", \"teeth\", \"fresh\", \"dental\", \"personal\"]","ALS":"14.7"},{"english_id":"323","id":"324","level":"4","topic":"11","title":"Friendship Day","article":"Friendship Day takes place on the first Sunday of August every year.

On Friendship Day people spend time with their friends and exchange presents. Some people send cards, write special songs or bake friendship cakes. One great way to celebrate is to make a poster or create an album about your friend or friends. Perhaps include Winnie the Pooh on it because the United Nations made Pooh the world’s Ambassador of Friendship in 1997.\n\nFriends are extremely important to us. They are often like members of our own family. In fact, many people spend more time with their friends than with their relatives. People also tell their friends more secrets. We start friendships almost from the time we can walk. Everyone has special childhood friends, and some of these become lifelong friends. We usually meet out best friends early on in our life. Best friends usually stay best friends forever. Nowadays the Internet has changed the way we make friends. Many people strike up friendships online. The Web is also useful to find long-lost friends.

Fun at Work Day changes this a little so that people’s jobs are not all work and no play. The idea behind this event is that workers perform better if they can relax and laugh. Production increases and there is better customer service. It is also better for the health of the staff. Having fun at work also creates better relations, especially if the bosses join in and share the fun.\n\nHaving fun at work is an important part of many large companies today. Internet companies like Google and Yahoo encourage their workers to relax and do things at work to let off steam. Workers set up mini basketball hoops in their offices and people can wear what they want and decorate their desks. Fun at work has been studied by experts. Psychologist and author Matt Weinstein wrote a book on management called ‘Managing to Have Fun’.

Though a Hindu festival, it is played by Indians from all communities – especially in the metropolitan cities of India, where people from all over the country have come and settled. On the day of Holi, it is as if the clock stops running, for it is a national holiday. Even for the newspapers.The festivities start early in the morning. People who prefer a gentler Holi greet each other by applying gulal or dry colours on each other. The adventurous ones splash coloured water, water balloons or simply turn the water pipes on!! Those who want to make others squirm use pukka or fast colours mixed in water – or even paint. But it is a fact that this festival is enjoyed the most if there is a large gathering echoing with laughter, gentle pranks and jokes.You name the color and it is there. The more multicolored or horrible you are to look at, the better you feel. If only the eyes and teeth are visible, it is ideal. Water balloons are the biggest source of excitement for children, who can aim them at anyone. On the day of Holi there are few restrictions. For once, parents too don’t pester them by telling them not to throw balloons; many of them also join the fun.The good thing about going from house to house and greeting neighbours and friends is that you get to eat special flour-based sweets like gujiya and malpua, and savouries like mattri. It does not matter that you don’t really know the person in whose house you are wolfing down so many things.Come lunch time and it is time to turn homewards and hope that the authorities have supplied extra water so that one can take off all the colours. Still, Holi does leave its imprint on many a face for days to come.This is the kind of Holi that most children and adults like to play. But there are many people who use the lack of restrictions and turn a friendly fight into a violent one. There are those who start aiming coloured balloons at people even a week before Holi, which leads to fights. The newspapers that come out two days after Holi, always have some violence or the other to report.But then, the majority of children and adults do celebrate this festival in the way it is meant to be. So lets hope that the first Holi of the new millennium turns out to merry.WISH YOU ALL A VERY HAPPY HOLI AND ENJOY YOURSELF.","keyword":"[\"holi\", \"balloon\", \"colour\", \"water\", \"restriction\", \"festival\"]","ALS":"24.428571428571427"},{"english_id":"333","id":"334","level":"4","topic":"9","title":"Honesty Day","article":"Be honest.

On IND, nurses take part in different events to highlight the importance of their work. They give ordinary people a chance to learn about the work they do. Many hospitals and clinics organize fund-raising events to highlight the work of nurses. IND was started in the USA in 1965. The International Council For Nurses decided it was important to have a special day to raise awareness of the important work of nurses. It is also a day for nurses to pat themselves on the back and be proud of doing such a valuable job.\n\nFlorence Nightingale is known as the founder of modern nursing. She was British, but was born in Italy in 1820. She was named after her birth place, the city of Florence. She went to good schools and her parents thought she would marry a rich gentleman, which is what all good ladies did then. However, she felt the need to help people and became a nurse. Her parents were shocked. She started her nursing career when she was 33. A year later, she went to Turkey to help British soldiers wounded in the Crimean War. She worked very long hours into the early hours of the morning and got the nickname “lady of the lamp”. She greatly improved conditions in the hospital and changed hospital care and nursing forever.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"nurse\", \"florence\", \"hospital\", \"nightingale\", \"nursing\", \"lady\"]","ALS":"14.523809523809524"},{"english_id":"354","id":"355","level":"4","topic":"15","title":"International Panic Day","article":"Are you a panic?

No one really knows where this day originated, but it seems a good idea to have a day when we can all freak out. Or maybe it’s a day when we tell others not to panic. “Don’t panic. Do NOT hit the panic button. Do not hit panic stations. The world is not about to end!” I’m sure this will calm down your panicking and panicky friends. It is strange that all previous International Panic Days have gone so smoothly.\n\nSo what is panic, exactly? It is a sudden, uncontrollable fear or anxiety that makes us lose our ability to think normally. Panic takes over our mind and makes us behave in a frightened way. We typically panic in dangerous situations such as earthquakes or at the sound of gunfire. Panic can spread very quickly. We see this where there are large crowds of people and something happens to create panic. Soon there is a stampede, which can be fatal. People also panic if they think they are going to lose money. We read all the time about ‘financial’, ‘stock market’ and ‘economic’ panic. We see people in a panic every day, rushing to meet a deadline or trying to find a lost document on a messy desk.

These tell the story of the slave trade. Other events involve musicians, actors and artists using music, dance, art and drama to highlight the history of the slave trade. Slavery can be traced back to our earliest historical records. It has existed at some time in almost all cultures and continents. Today it is outlawed in nearly all countries.

The holiday started in 1894. The Central Labor Union in New York City campaigned for “a day off for the working citizens”. Working conditions were much harder back then and there were few holidays and times for rest. Many people worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The original Labor Day celebrations were street parades and festivals for workers and their families. This became the pattern for Labor Day celebrations. There were also speeches by important men and women.\n\nToday, most Americans view Labor Day as a day of rest and an opportunity to look at street parades. Many families have picnics or barbecues in the daytime and attend fireworks displays in the evening. There are many community events, often involving sports. Families with children often use the holiday to go on a final trip before school starts again in September. Labor Day is an important date in the sporting calendar. It marks the beginning of the NFL and college football seasons. The tradition of speeches continues, although the speeches tend to be by politicians trying to get more votes in the run-up to elections.

His leadership in the campaign to achieve equal rights for black Americans changed America forever. His focus on non-violent protests led to new laws that ended racial discrimination in America.

At first, the holiday was not popular with all American states. Some didn’t like the name and so they called it “Civil Rights Day”. However, in the year 2000, all 50 states observed the holiday using its correct name. The musician Stevie Wonder helped the campaign for the holiday. He released a hit single called “Happy Birthday” in 1980. The song made millions of Americans aware of the campaign.

We waste money and energy by using electric dryers, which also add to global warming. Using a clothes line can actually save the average household several hundred dollars a year.

From there, it travelled to Greece. Records from the ancient Greek empire, around 500BC, describe a circular toy made out of wood. The world’s oldest yo-yo dates to this period. Not all yo-yos were toys. There are reports that the yo-yo was a weapon for over 400 years in the Philippines. Today, the yo-yo is a part of every child’s toy cupboard. Young and old love playing with it and demonstrating their skills. It is perhaps one of the most successful toys ever. All around America, there are yo-yo competitions on June 6. Many yo-yo enthusiasts believe it should be an Olympic sport. There is definitely an art and a skill to good yo-yoing.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"duncan\", \"flores\", \"donald\", \"strength\", \"competition\", \"skill\"]","ALS":"12.2"},{"english_id":"388","id":"389","level":"4","topic":"16","title":"Nerd & Geek Pride Day","article":"Nerd Pride Day, also called Geek Pride Day, is a fun and serious day that celebrates nerds and geeks.

It is now officially celebrated in America and other countries. Many nerd and geek bloggers hold parades and write special blogs about nerdiness and geekiness. There is a manifesto that contains the basic rights and responsibilities of nerds. This includes the right to be “even nerdier;” to “not leave your house;” and to “have few friends (or none at all)”.\n\nIt is hard to find a definition of a nerd or geek on the Internet. perhaps the best clue is; “You know one when you see one.” A few common characteristics of nerds and geeks might include the following: 1. Having dreams of achieving things normal people don’t have. 2. Being unusually interested in technology, especially more unusual hardware and software. 3. An interest in a hobby or pastime others might think is obsessive. Geeks are extremely important to society. It was because they stayed at home, had big dreams and spent hours every day on their hobby that we now have computers.

If someone tells you ‘You don’t look so good today,’ you say ‘thank you’. Or perhaps that should be ‘No thank you’. If you have ever tried this for yourself, it can be quite confusing, although it is fun. Children love playing this as a game and usually end up in non-stop laughter. Some psychologists have said that playing using opposite meanings is a good “philosophy course” for kids  it gets them thinking. It could also be the day when ‘opposites attract,’ which means two people who have totally different characters start a relationship.\n\nOpposite Day can be a very useful day for students. This is a good time to get out vocabulary notebooks and find the antonyms, or opposites, to different words. Students could focus on prefixes that are used to give a word an opposite meaning. For example ‘un’ in ‘unhelpful’ and ‘unnecessary’, or ‘il’ in illegal’ and ‘illogical’. There are many more. Actually, Opposite Day reminds me of a little verse I learnt as a child. Here it is: “One bright morning in the middle of the night, two dead boys got up to fight. Back to back, they faced each other. Drew their swords and shot each other.

Americans are more familiar with Mardi Gras, which is also on the day before Ash Wednesday and is a very similar celebration. Different countries hold different events for Pancake Day. In England, some towns have pancake races. People must run a race with a frying pan and toss the pancakes as they run. The winner is the first person to cross the finishing line with a pancake that is still intact. Children like to have a go at tossing the hot pancakes out of the frying pan in their kitchens.

They include trees, bushes, vines, ferns, grasses, herbs, mosses, and green algae. People who study plants are called botanists. They say there are 350,000 species of plants in the world. Plants are important for all of our food. We eat fruit, vegetables and grains, and the animals we eat also eat plants. We also need plants to breathe. Plants have a system called photosynthesis which provides us with oxygen. Plants also provide us with materials for building things, like wood; and medicines. Even the energy we use is from plants.

Another legend says that people began exploding crackers to convey to the gods, their joy at being alive and well on earth.Rediscovering a Smoke-less Diwali [Illustration by Sudheer Nath]Now come back to the present when the uncontrolled celebration of the victory of good over evil itself seems to have become a source of pollution. For on the day after Diwali, the entire country looks like a planet devastated by a meteor.The smoke from crackers is one, if one doesn’t take into account the deafening sounds of the victory of good over evil. The smoke hangs, suspended in the morning air, accompanied by an acrid, pungent smell that makes it impossible to breathe.Millions of shreds of coloured paper that make up the body of the crackers, litter every nook and cranny. A reminder of the previous night’s revelries, they aren’t a pretty sight.But I’m not the only one turning up my nose at the noise and smoke. The number of people who are keen to fashion newer, friendlier ways of celebration and enjoyment, is on the rise.Children show the wayLast week, schoolchildren in Delhi took part in an environmental run organised by an NGO, Panchavati, and hosted by the Bluebells School, Delhi. Their aim was to tell shopkeepers: “We are no longer the buyers, you should no longer be the sellers.” They were referring to the buying and selling of firecrackers. And wonder of wonders, Delhi’s shopkeepers have reported a 25 per cent drop in cracker sales this year.Normally, it is the children who start “reminding” their parents (as if they are allowed to forget) long before Diwali, about the pressing need to stock up on crackers. But since last year, many parents in Delhi and other cities have been surprised out of their skins to hear their children say that they would not spend on crackers.For one, say the children, the crackers that they love are made by children their age or younger, in the factories of Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, in conditions that pose a grave danger to their health. Secondly, crackers have a polluting effect.The parents’ jaws have fallen collectively. For years they have been trying to talk about the hundreds or thousands of rupees that are blown up in seconds or about the injuries caused by firecracker accidents, but the children would not listen. This time, it is the children who are saying no to crackers, without being forced to doso.This change of heart and mind has been brought about in discussions and debates in schools, where teachers and children together have discovered some dark facts about the Festival of Lights.The government steps inThe government of Delhi, for instance, has carried on an effective campaign, ‘Say no to Crackers’. People have also been asked not to burst high-intensity crackers in the capital.High-intensity crackers increase noise-levels six to ten times more than the acceptable limits, often causing irreparable harm to the ear-drum.Group fun, great fun!More than 400 years ago, Mughal emperor Akbar started organising mammoth firework displays during Diwali. They called it aatishbazi or a grand show of fireworks. It is said that the fireworks display at Akbar’s capital Agra, could be seen from the Qutab Minar in Delhi as well.Maybe it is time for us to think of better ways to celebrate the victory of good over evil, by thinking of good ways to enjoy. For that governments need to think of stopping the exploitation of child workers by employers in fireworks factories instead of just banning high-intensity crackers. This is where the schoolchildren’s campaign last year proved to be so heartening.How about fewer and collective displays where people can pool resources for a grand show? Just think of it, even if ten families pool in just ten crackers each, they can have a glorious Diwali with a hundred crackers to light up the sky.Many residential areas do have community fireworks displays. They’re great fun to watch in an open park, very economical because each family only pays a very small amount as its share, and the pollution is less.And for the individual bit of celebration, let’s light up those lamps, hang the lovely kandeels or paper lanterns and pull out the rangoli colours.

There are also traditional St Patrick’s Day parades. The one in Dublin is spread over five days and attracts half a million people. The New York parade is the largest, with two million spectators. Many people with no Irish connections celebrate and declare themselves Irish for a day.\n\nSaint Patrick was a Christian missionary. Some scholars say he was born in England, while others believe he was Italian. Most agree he lived in the fifth century. When he was sixteen, he was captured and taken as a slave to Ireland. He lived as a slave for six years before escaping. He joined the church to train as a priest and became a missionary in the north and west of Ireland. Legend has it that Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland. There are many other legends about Patrick that have cemented him as a key part of Irish culture. March 17 is believed to be the date of his death.

Around one per cent of us use self-injury to deal with difficulties in our lives. Despite this, it is a greatly misunderstood condition.

The illness is listed as a mental condition that is linked to personality disorders and depression. The most common way of self-injury is cutting the skin in places the injurer can easily hide. Many self-injurers prefer to conceal their injuries. Other methods include skin picking, hair pulling, alcohol abuse and forms of anorexia and bulimia. Many self-injurers say they get physical pleasure from their behaviour. The body releases natural drugs, endorphins, in response to physical injury.

And mothers are no less than heroes, considering the amount of effort they put into making their children’s lives a bit more easy and happier. Perhaps some of us may remember this the rest of the year as well.Why Mother’s Day? []The idea of Mother’s Day has existed in some form or the other for a long time. Ancient Greeks used to celebrate the beginning of spring by honouring Rhea, the mother of the Gods.Four hundred years ago, the English celebrated a festival called “Mothering Sunday” just before Easter, one of the most important festivals for Christians. On this day, women who worked as servants in the houses of the rich, were given a holiday. They could return to their homes and spend the day with their mothers. In other words, on that day, they were mothered. A special cake, called the Mothering Cake was also made on that day.But, what we know as Mother’s Day today, began less than a 100 years ago. It was started by Ann Jarvis, who lived in Philadelphia in the United States.When her mother, Ann Marie Reeves Jarvis, died in 1905, Ann wanted to do something for her. She decided to create a special day to keep the memory of her mother alive. On her mother’s second death anniversary, she asked her mother’s church in Grafton in West Virginia, to celebrate Mother’s Day. It was the second Sunday in May. Many people came for the celebration.Then, Jarvis asked the American government to declare the second Sunday in May a holiday to honour mothers. Her wish was granted. And, in 1910, West Virginia became the first state to mark Mother’s Day. A year later, nearly every state in the US had a Mother’s Day holiday. And in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson officially proclaimed Mother’s Day as a national holiday to be observed on the second Sunday of May.This is where the story becomes interesting. Thirteen years later, in 1923, Jarvis filed a case to stop the Mother’s Day festival. She felt that the feeling with which she had started the festival, had gone. Now companies were more interested in using Mother’s Day to make profits.When Jarvis died at the age of 84 in 1948, she was very unhappy. Never a mother herself, she had spent the entire fortune her mother had left her in trying to stop the festival she had founded. And, just before her death, she told a reporter that she was sorry she had ever started Mother’s Day. She did not succeed in bringing a stop to the festival she had started.Today, Mother’s Day is celebrated in various countries across the world. Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia and Belgium also celebrate Mother’s Day on the same day as the United States, on the second Sunday in the month of May. And, now even Indians are celebrating Mother’s Day on the same day.So, if you want to make a card for your mother on Mother’s Day, why don’t you learn how to make some interesting ones from our activities section.","keyword":"[\"mother\", \"jarvis\", \"honour\", \"sunday\", \"festival\", \"virginia\"]","ALS":"23.413793103448278"},{"english_id":"424","id":"425","level":"4","topic":"19","title":"Work Your Proper Hours Day","article":"Work Your Proper Hours Day is usually around February 22.

Under 40% of the world’s blood supply comes from the developing world, where 82% of the world’s population live.\n\nBlood is, of course, the red liquid that makes some of us faint when we see it. It delivers oxygen and vital nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, to our body's cells. It also carries away waste products, like carbon dioxide, from our cells to keep our body clean. Seven per cent of our body weight is blood. The average adult has about five litres of blood. Our heart pumps blood around our body at high speed. It travels through a system of arteries and veins, that reach every part of our body. Our blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. When we cut ourselves, it is the job of platelets to clot the blood to stop us bleeding. We all have one of four different blood types. If we are given a different blood type, we’ll die.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"blood\", \"donor\", \"cell\", \"platelet\", \"acid\", \"develop\"]","ALS":"15.045454545454545"},{"english_id":"430","id":"431","level":"4","topic":"8","title":"World Cancer Day","article":"World Cancer Day falls on February the 4th each year.

Eleven million new cases are reported annually. World Cancer Day started in 2005 as part of the World Cancer Campaign. It followed the World Summit Against Cancer in the New Millennium, which took place in 2000. Many international organizations hold awareness campaigns and fundraising events on this day. In particular, the World Health Organization and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) are very active. In 2008, the UICC promoted the “I love my smoke-free childhood year” against passive smoking.\n\nCancer is the growth and spread of damaged cells in the body that destroy or kill healthy cells. It can affect almost any part of the body. Common types of cancer include lung cancer, breast cancer and stomach cancer. People can reduce the risk of getting cancer by avoiding common risk factors such as tobacco and drinking alcohol. Smoking is one of the biggest causes of lung cancer. Not all cancers will kill you. Many can be cured by surgery or by treatments such as chemotherapy. Cancer is the world’s biggest killer. It kills more people than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria put together. Many deaths can be avoided. With adequate funding, health authorities could prevent 40% of all cancers and cure 30% of those caught early.","keyword":"[\"cancer\", \"uicc\", \"lung\", \"kill\", \"smoking\", \"cure\"]","ALS":"14"},{"english_id":"431","id":"432","level":"4","topic":"2","title":"World Car-Free Day","article":"World Car-Free Day is a very important holiday on the environmental calendar.

Carlos Pardo from Colombia’s Sustainable Urban Transport Project summed things up, saying: “World Car-Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city, but a demonstration of what is possible: unclogged streets, clean air, and city traffic participants with their usual stress levels turned down drastically.”\n\nWorld Car-Free Day aims to take a sizeable number of cars off the streets for all or part of a day. This will give people a chance to see what their town might look like with a lot fewer cars. The idea for this day came in October 1994 at the International Accessible Cities Conference in Toledo, Spain. The first national campaign was held in Britain three years later. The European Union adopted the idea in 2000. Today, as many as 100 million people in over 1,500 cities worldwide celebrate this day. There are many critics of the day.

WSPD promotes ways to identify possible suicide cases and to prevent suicide. The day is organized by the International Association for Suicide Prevention. This important group acts as a forum for academics, mental health professionals, and suicide survivors to work together to understand suicide better. They raise awareness that suicide is a preventable cause of hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world.\n\nThe word suicide comes from Latin, meaning to kill oneself. There are many factors that lead to someone taking their own life. These include depression, shame, physical pain, anxiety, and relationship problems. A growing reason nowadays is financial difficulties. There is a sudden increase in suicide in rich nations when there is a downturn in the economy. Another worrying trend is the number of young people who resort to suicide because of bullying. Suicide is in fact one of the leading causes of death among teenagers and young adults. In Japan, there are Internet suicide clubs so you can end your life with others who are equally desperate.

It is called an internal martial art because it is not used for self-defence, but is instead practiced for health reasons. Doctors say it has benefits for those who have heart and blood pressure problems. Many people who practice it say it relieves stress and makes you live longer. Tai Chi is famous around the world for its followers doing their morning slow motion routines in parks. Traditionalists say that Tai Chi is a mixture of self defence and health and that these represent the two opposing forces of yin and yang.

It employs millions of people and generates billions of dollars. Many developing countries rely on tourist dollars for their survival. In recent decades tourism has boomed. People are richer, air travel is cheaper and many closed borders are coming down. The collapse of communism has seen millions of new tourists coming out of Russia and the former communist countries. This increase in tourism does create problems. In many of the world’s top tourist destinations, there is a strain on the environment.

These range from nature walks, clean-up days and seminars to new government laws to protect the wetlands.\n\nThe world’s wetlands serve an important role in nature. They are all mini eco-systems and contain a huge diversity of animal and plant life. They take the form of ponds, streams, rivers, bogs and swamps. They also serve an important role in the flood defences of an area. Wetlands are like giant sponges and store water from floods. They can protect an area from flooding from storms and high tides. This is coming under threat now with rising sea levels and global warming. Climate change means any wetlands are themselves being flooded or are drying up and disappearing. Wetlands are also a wonderful way to explore nature and see a huge variety of water life, plants, animals and birds.

Suggestions include holding peaceful protests outside zoos, writing letters to newspapers and setting up information stalls to tell people that animals belong in the wild. CAPS says: “We don’t need zoos anymore….Keeping these beautiful creatures caged up and bored to tears for our sake is just plain wrong.” What do you think of zoos?

Well, if you have, then you know how scary it is when the camel rises on its long wobbly legs. The rocking motion of a camel is a bit like a ship being tossed around in heaving seas. Small wonder then that the camel is often called the ship of the desert. Actually, the name owes its origins to the fact that camels were brought from the desert, to serve as beasts of burden in other countries.Among the oldest domesticated animals in the world, camels have been used by humans as beasts of burden for more than 10,000 years now. There are very few wild camels left.A Dromedary camel in the Rub al Khali or Empty Quarter. Straddling Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Yemen, this is the largest sand desert in the world.Most of us are only familiar with one species of camel, known as the Dromedary camel. This animal is single-humped, has long legs and is found in the deserts of Asia and Africa. Another specie (the two-humped shorter-legged Bactrian camel) is found in parts of China and Central Asia.A bactrian camel standing high in the mountains of Caucasus, Russia.Recently, scientists discovered what they think is a new species of wild camel that lives in a remote part of China. These mammals look very similar to the Bactrian camel but they have a unique feature – they survive by drinking salty water.Strangely enough, scientists knew about the existence of the animal, but had no idea of their unique identity – their ability to survive on salty water. As a result, researchers now admit that these animals are not Bactrian camels as initially thought, but a new species.The only visible physical difference is that the saltwater drinking specie has its humps further apart than the Bactrian camel. Researchers also discovered that the kneecaps of the ‘new specie’ are quite different from that of their domesticated cousins.Camels are most common in the African and Asian deserts, but fossil evidence shows that camels originated in North America about 45 million years ago. So how did they manage to trapeze into Africa? Well, millions of years ago, North America and Asia were connected by a land mass – the present-day Bering Strait.Scientists think that the camels migrated into South America and across to Asia, disappearing almost entirely from the land of its origin. However, many researchers say that the South American llama is a direct descendent of the camel.As for the new specie of camel, there are fewer than 800 of them left, for people hunt camels for their meat in this barren part of China. It seems to be more of an endangered specie than the giant panda and may well earn the distinction of becoming extinct at the time of its discovery.","keyword":"[\"camel\", \"bactrian\", \"desert\", \"specie\", \"dromedary\", \"china\"]","ALS":"32"},{"english_id":"470","id":"471","level":"4","topic":"18","title":"A Smelly New World on the Web","article":"Every time you blink, someone is forming an Internet company somewhere in the world.

Each one is searching for the one great idea that could make his web company click in a big way. And they are trying all sorts of gimmicks to attract people towards their websites.While some websites offer sounds, animation and dazzling graphics on screen to make their sites almost a movie-like experience for the viewer, others provide free downloads and contests.A company based in California, US, has decided to offer online smells to people who visit its website. That is, if a pizza image comes on screen your nostrils will catch the smell of baked bread and gooey cheese! All you need to do is attach a device called ‘iSmell’ to your computer. This smart little device, created by the company, contains some chemicals, which when combined in different proportions, can create a huge variety of smells.The company has invented software that converts the complex chemical composition of different smells into digital signals. An onscreen image, which is programmed with the appropriate digital signal, will activate the ‘iSmell’ device. The device will use the software to reconvert the digital signal and release the correct smell. This gadget reads the digital scent code from the website and creates the corresponding smell from its store of chemicals. This smell is then made to waft in the direction of the user with the aid of a small fan.To ensure that the correct smell is released, the company has created a ‘Scent Registry,’ which contains a digital index of thousands of scents. The company plans to permit website developers to integrate the appropriate smells (in digital code) to their games and images. The company is also hoping that Hollywood filmmakers will incorporate the smell technology in their movies.

Many film directors, too, have been fond of shooting action-packed or emotional scenes at railway stations. The famous action scene at the end of the Hollywood Western ‘High Noon’ showed the cowboy hero, Gary Cooper, silencing the villain. In one Indian film after another, the hero and the heroine have rushed across a crowded station to meet each other never to be separated.Now the Indian Railways has stepped in to make a more effective use of its 7,000 stations all over the country. If the plan succeeds, the stations will connect hundreds of villages to the World Wide Web, according to a report by the British Broadcasting Service (BBC).It’s very simple, really. These stations cover all the major cities, towns and villages. All these stations are connected through cables that maintain telephonic communication between the stations.A team of railway engineers is planning to use the existing cable network to provide Internet connections on rail routes. This way they can avoid the time and money required to lay a fresh cable network to provide Internet connections to villages on the rail routes. This would make the Internet connections very cheap.Telephonic conversations are digitally coded into light and transmitted very, very quickly, over great distances through fibre optic cables. These cables have a much larger capacity than copper cables that is normally used. A single pair of light-transmitting optical fibres can carry over three thousand conversations simultaneously. One single cable contains more than 50 such fibre pairs! The Indian Railways plans to replace the existing copper cables with these high-tech optical fibres. After that is done, opportunities for Internet connectivity will increase tremendously.This Internet project also includes the setting up of cyber cafes in stations for local people who do not own a computer system. The engineers involved in the project are also thinking of developing low cost Internet monitors to make the computer more affordable to them. In India, the stations are located at an average distance of seven km, and each station will be set up to enable wireless Internet connection to more than a hundred households in the vicinity.The project is being tried out in a small area first. The railway engineers are using the cable connection along 40 km of railway track that links the southern towns of Vijaywada and Guntur. The track has five stations and each of the stations will also provide wireless Internet connections for 10 to 15 participating households within a 10 km radius.If the project succeeds, it would be a feather in the cap of the Indian Railways. But, it will still have to deal with the problem of frequent power cuts.

But unlike their slow-moving cousins, octopuses can move very fast indeed. That’s because their tentacles are covered with small suction pads, with which they cling well to clammy rocks and slippery ocean floors.These suction pads are also super-sensitive to touch and taste. An octopus’ sense of taste is 10 to 100 times more sensitive than that of a human!Its eyes, too, are highly developed. Thus it can see clearly in dark or murky water. That equips the clever octopus to hunt at night. This clever creature lures its pray by wriggling the tip of a tentacle so that it looks like a worm.When it is threatened, the octopus secretes an inky substance. This is meant to confuse predators, which gives it time to escape.Most poisons produced by the octopuses are too weak to harm humans.

New species are being discovered every year. Six of the world’s seven species of marine turtle live in the Barrier Reef.However, the reef is in danger today.

Well, that’s not all that can be said about these mighty creatures. Eating is but necessary for survival — and you never know, Anacondas might eat humans too, if one goes near them! But apart from their strange eating habits, these snakes are amazing in a lot of other ways too.The Anaconda (Eunectes murinus) is a semi-aquatic snake found in Central America and mostly in tropical South America. It belongs to the Boa family, Boidae, and is dark green in colour with round black markings. A smaller species is the Yellow Anaconda (E. notaeus), which is yellowish green with irregular dark blotches. Not only does it have a bright looking skin with a distinct colour pattern, but also it is also BIG, I mean, really LOOOO……NG! It may reach a length of even 25 feet – which is roughly four times a reasonably tall adult human being! (Pythons, however, are much longer, and have been recorded to be of even 33 feet!)And what’s more, the Giant Anaconda or Water Boa may live upto even 50 years – which is more than what most animals do!With all that, would you believe that the Anaconda is not venomous? In fact, less than one-third of the 2,500 to 3,000 snake species known are poisonous and even fewer than 300 species may be fatal to humans. But sadly, snakes have, almost always, an ominous presence in the minds of people as dark and deadly poisonous creatures, which is created and perpetuated by myths, folklore, books, films, etc. Quite on the contrary, if you actually happen to come by a snake, in all probability it will be more scared of you than you will be of it! And it would not harm you if you don’t harm it either.But, our handsome friend here, the Anaconda, is quite different from other snakes. It kills by constriction, that is, it wraps itself strongly around its prey, squeezing and suffocating the animal to death. And then it swallows its meal whole! And sometimes it might take even several weeks to digest a single prey! Oh, what a lazy and gluttonous animal it is! Anacondas can swallow animals as big as full-grown deer.The Anaconda can glide smoothly and easily in water just like a submarine. Its eyes and nostrils are strategically placed on its small flat head, which peer above the surface of the water like a periscope. This allows the animal to ambush its prey, for example an unsuspecting water bird, without chasing it.The mating habits of Anacondas are rather interesting. Many males may fight among themselves to mate with a single female! Researchers have seen as many as 13 male anacondas writhe and wriggle in such a fight, which looks more like a slow-motion wrestling match that lasts for several weeks! The female and male are different in appearance – for the female is five times bulkier than the male! This difference in size between the sexes is much greater in Anacondas than in any other animal.Most snakes lay eggs which then hatch after a period of time to bring forth the young. The Anaconda’s eggs, on the other hand, hatch just before laying, and the mother Anaconda gives birth to several baby Anacondas. Sometimes, a clutch (the place where the young snakes are born) may have more than 70 newborns! With such a large brood, Mama Anaconda might be feeling rather proud! Researchers are uncertain, though, whether a single male or more father the offspring.But Nature sure has its own way of maintaining the ecological balance, for about half the young Anacondas are eaten by predators like caimans, etc. within the first year itself, and only few remain alive to grow up into big and strong adults. This is necessary, otherwise the Anaconda population would have increased at a very alarming rate. And you can imagine what would have happened if the predating animals didn’t eat the baby Anacondas. There might have been so many Anacondas in the world that they would have been everywhere — out on the streets and in our homes!","keyword":"[\"anaconda\", \"snake\", \"male\", \"dark\", \"prey\", \"eating\"]","ALS":"24.333333333333332"},{"english_id":"478","id":"479","level":"4","topic":"18","title":"And Now, Schoolbags Online","article":"Who wants to carry a bulky bag to school?

And then they break off when the mating season is over.Antlers: A Deer StoryThe antlers are basically a means to attract the opposite sex during the mating season. Stags use antlers in contests of strength with other deer — a winning male usually secures more female mates.It has been noticed that the deer also uses its antlers to defend itself. It also uses it to mark his territory. It makes marks on trees to let other antlers know that that particular area is his home.Antlers are often mistaken for horns. But, they are very different from a cow’s horns. They are never hollow and they have a honeycomb like structure. While in some deer, the antlers may be single shafts, in some, they could have as many as 11 branches each.The number of branches always varies with age. So, a deer’s age can be calculated with the help of its antlers.Antlers: A deer storyIn the first year, the deer grows two knoblike things on his forehead. These are called pedicles. When the antlers break off, they break from the pedicles and grow at the same spot next year. In the second year, a straight spike grows out of the pedicle, and in the third year, the first branch appears.When the antlers are growing, they are covered with a sensitive skin called the “velvet”. The velvet is filled with blood vessels which helps the bone to grow. When the antlers reach their full size, a ring is formed at the base of the antlers which cuts off the blood supply to the velvet. With no blood supply, the velvet withers, dries up and finally falls off. Whatever is left is rubbed off by the deer on the branches of trees.","keyword":"[\"antler\", \"deer\", \"velvet\", \"pedicle\", \"branch\", \"grow\"]","ALS":"22.31578947368421"},{"english_id":"480","id":"481","level":"4","topic":"7","title":"Are Fish Dumb?","article":"There was a time when people thought that fish were dumb creatures.

The fish explode after coming up as if they have little crackers bursting inside their stomachs. These are the redfish, or the ocean perch as they are called.They live in very deep waters — as deep as 400 metres. That would be like living 135 storeys below water!There is a very simple explanation about the explosions in their bodies. These fish have a gas-filled swim bladder which helps them float. They adjust the size of this bladder when they want to rest on the water’s surface.The problem arises when these fish are suddenly pulled out of the water by the fisherman’s hook or net. They do not get enough time to expel the extra amount of air in their bladders. As the water pressure decreases, the bladder expands and sometimes explodes. If the bladder doesn’t explode, the fish’s shape gets distorted. Often, the stomach is thrust out of its mouth.Fish that stay even 10 metres below the surface can also get injured if they are suddenly pulled up by a fisherman’s net.","keyword":"[\"bladder\", \"fish\", \"explode\", \"fisherman\", \"talk\", \"suddenly\"]","ALS":"19.4375"},{"english_id":"481","id":"482","level":"4","topic":"6","title":"Beautiful Flowers that Stink!","article":"A blow-fly was looking for an ideal place to lay eggs.

But have you ever heard of a bird eating its own feathers?It is a bird which lives in water and is called the great crested grebe. It eats its own feathers and feeds them to her young ones too. And, it always prefers soft feathers, which it sheds throughout the year.Scientists believe that its feather-eating habit is linked to the process with which it throws waste.The grebe has a unique excretory system. It throws out one or two balls of excreta through its mouth on every alternate day. The staple diet of grebes is fish. So, the ball of waste has indigestible fish bones and scales apart from gastric parasites.It is important for the grebe to throw these parasites out. If it didn’t, they would attack the grebe’s intestines and make him sick.According to scientists, the feathers add roughage to its waste. It makes it easier to form the ball of excreta, to throw it out.The grebe’s feathers are silky to touch and are black or gray in colour. Sometimes, it may be reddish on top with white underparts. It is usually 7 to 10 inches long, has short wings and a pointed bill.Another unique feature of the bird are its toes. They are united to form a web near the base, while the remaining portions are rounded flaps. The shape of its toes help it to swim. In fact, the grebes are excellent swimmers and they use their feet only for propulsion under water.When preening, grebes eat their own feathers, and feed them to their young.The grebe makes its nest on floating leaves or plants and lays about two to 10 eggs in it. Although the eggs are white in the beginning, they begin to get stained as the leaves on which the nest is made begins to decay.Both the male and female grebe incubate the eggs and care for the young ones. The young grebes have stripes on them.There are 18 to 20 species of grebes living around the world, some of which are endangered.","keyword":"[\"grebe\", \"feather\", \"throw\", \"excreta\", \"ball\", \"bird\"]","ALS":"24.1875"},{"english_id":"490","id":"491","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"Chimp Traits","article":"Do you think chimps are chumps? If the answer is yes, then you are in for a surprise – because chimps or chimpanzees are actually very, very intelligent. Chimpanzees are the most intelligent of the ape family. It was known that chimpanzees use tools intelligently to obtain food. They use rocks to crack open nuts or use sticks to dig the earth for choice insects and termites.Once a chimpanzee learns a certain method he\/she teaches it on to all the other chimps in the area. Scientists say that different groups of chimps follow different customs or styles related to eating, grooming and courtship. So this teaching one group’s ‘customs’ to another group is an act of ‘culturally transmitting a ritual’.Chimpanzees at the Madrid zoo in Spain are a step ahead. They are now puréeing (mashing) up their food themselves. This has amazed both visitors and researchers alike for this is the first instance of an ape transforming food to improve its taste and quality.A contemplative bonobo?It all started with Linda, a chimp who had lost all her teeth. Linda could only eat mashed up fruits and vegetable as she could not chew her food without teeth. One day, Linda was seen eating hard apples. She first rubbed the fruit against a sharp corner of the wall. Then she licked the mashed fruit bits off the wall. Soon other chimps in Linda’s cage began imitating her unique method of mashing up fruit. The clever chimps now were eatting apples, carrots and oranges the same way.Primatologists (scientists who study the behaviour of monkeys and apes) agree that chimps are clever in using tools to open nuts and dig up insects. But they have never been known to pulp the food or mash or grind it before eating. Mashing or pulping food changes the quality adding taste and flavour to the food item.Although chimps are known to have learnt nearly 40 other behaviour methods in this way, researchers are still trying to understand how and where Linda learnt to mash food. Scientists are also not sure if chimps in the wild also mash their food in a similar way.Most scientists say that only captive animals display such human-like methods because the animals are bored and have the time to experiment. Adult animals, in the wild, cannot afford to waste time – they are too busy searching for a meal. On the other hand, young chimps have time to play around and are therefore, more inventive.It is amazing how much chimps and humans have in common. Over 90 percent of our genes are similar. Both humans and chimpanzees belong to a group of tropical animals called primates (which include monkeys and apes). Apes can easily be distinguished from monkeys, for they lack tails. Apes are larger than monkeys and have a more complex brain. Apes are also known as hominids – which means humanlike.Orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees are known as great apes because they are larger and heavier than the lesser apes like the gibbon. The Orangutan is also the only great ape found in Asia in the islands of Sumatra and Borneo.","keyword":"[\"chimp\", \"mash\", \"chimpanzee\", \"linda\", \"monkey\", \"food\"]","ALS":"22.153846153846153"},{"english_id":"491","id":"492","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"Cigarette Packs that Talk","article":"Cigarette smoking is injurious to health – everyone knows that. Well, till a few decades ago, people were unaware that smoking could cause lung and heart diseases and cigarette packs never had a warning on them, like they do now.In recent years, research has shown that smoking is dangerous and it has now been made compulsory for all cigarette manufacturers to have what is known as, a ‘statutory warning’ printed on the cover. It states that ‘cigarette smoking is injurious to health’.However, cigarette manufacturers do not want people to stop buying their product by reading the warning. So, they have found a convenient way of dealing with the problem. They print the mandatory warning in such small letters that one can barely read them.While European health authorities are now insisting that the size of the letters used in these health warnings should be increased, one British engineering firm, Molins, that supplies machines to make cigarettes, has gone a step ahead. The company wants to patent a talking cigarette packet that recites a health warning every time you open it.A patent is a document issued by the government giving the company the exclusive right to the invention. Making it impossible for any other person or company to manufacture the product.How does it work?The talking packet uses a technology similar to the one used in musical cards. A stiff plastic strip is attached to the lid of the cigarette packet.When the pack is opened, the strip comes into contact with a tiny battery cell (the kind used in watches), which is wired to a small speaker on the base of the pack. This triggers a playback of the health warning.Will cigarette manufacturers opt for these talking packets?Anti-smoking organisations are thrilled with the invention and are insisting that all tobacco manufacturers should use these packs. However, without government intervention, cigarette manufacturers will pay no heed to the request and continue to use tiny-lettered health warnings on their packets.","keyword":"[\"cigarette\", \"health\", \"warning\", \"manufacturer\", \"packet\", \"pack\"]","ALS":"36.1"},{"english_id":"492","id":"493","level":"4","topic":"6","title":"Dangerous Red Tide in HongKong","article":"Sea beaches around HongKong have a problem. They regularly face the threat of a ‘Red Tide’.The ‘Red Tide’ kills fish in sea farms and in the open seas. Actually, the ‘Red Tide’ is reddish brown algae that floats on water near the coastline. It enters the gills of the fish swimming about in the sea and kills them.The gills are like noses of the fish. They help the fish breathe. When the algae enters the gills, it creates havoc.The algae-infected gills fills with mucus and the fish die because they cannot breathe. Their noses do not get any oxygen.Algae can live in water and in moist soils. Like any other plant, they also use the green pigment chlorophyll to make food. But sometimes, the green pigment is covered by another coloured pigment. So algae may have various colours, like blue-green, red, yellow-green and brown. They make their own food and are a source of food for fish.But when fish approach them for food, some of them enter the fish’s gills, leading to disaster.Nearly 1,500 tons of fish have died in sea water fish farms in the recent past. As a result bodies of dead fish often float near the coast of HongKong.Initially, the Hong Kong authorities were not concerned about the algae menace. They thought it was because of sewage pollution.Sometimes, chemicals thrown into the sea brings about the growth of algae. If this happens in lakes and ponds, fish die as algae remove all the oxygen from the water by their rapid growth.Now the evergrowing reddish brown algae has left the authorities worried. Because it is not connected to sewage. And it could prove to be a health hazard too.

They are trying to make the world agree to a standard procedure to deal with such a possibility.They propose that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (an US organisation that manages emergency situations like hurricanes or floods) should also recognise a meteor impact as a potential danger and respond to it the way it responds to floods, hurricanes and earthquakes.They want to make people and the government believe that the threat, though remote, is massive enough to lay down disaster management strategies for.An attempt has been made to identify objects that can strike the earth.

Scientists propose attaching the comet with a huge rocket to nudge it away or striking the comet with a nuclear warhead in an attempt to smash it to pieces.However, the scientists believe that such an operation would require space observatories, scientists and the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) to work together.One such threat was cited when astronomers announced that an object, known as 2000 SG344, had a 1-in-500 chance of hitting the Earth in 2030.

Some plants produce chemicals that give the leaves and stem a strong taste or smell of chillies, spices and herbs used for cooking. These substances either discourage or even kill insects and other animals that might try to eat the plant.Since plants cannot escape from creatures that feed on them, many have evolved features to protect them against herbivorous or plant eating animals.

There are people who lose the ability to understand or use words due to brain damage. But they become extremely good at something else. They become experts at spotting liars. By the changing expressions of people’s faces and the tone of their voice they can make out lies from truth.The condition in which people lose their power to understand or words due to brain damage is called aphasia. A study conducted in Massachusetts, USA, has clearly proved that aphasics make good lie detectors.In the last 100 years, many neurologists, or doctors studying the brain, have mentioned examples of this amazing power of patients suffering from aphasia. Some have even compared an aphasic’s powers to that of a dog with an ability to sniff out people who are faking.Recently, scientists conducted tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied the powers of a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasic. And it was proved clearly that the normal volunteers still got fooled by words. The aphasics were far ahead of them in recognising false speech. The results of the study were reported in the magazine ‘Nature’.Fourteen years ago, famous American neurologist, Dr Oliver Sacks, wrote about his experiences with aphasic patients in a book. The book’s name was equally interesting: ‘The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat’.Dr Sacks remembered a particular incident in a hospital. Patients from the aphasia ward were watching TV. Their president, Ronald Reagan, was giving a speech. Since he had been a film actor earlier, making a flashy speech was no problem for him. He was trying to put feelings into each and every word of his speech.Cogs in the shape of a thinking mind illustrating brain injury and neurological memory loss .But his speech had an opposite effect on the patients.

The President was lying!Many doctors have always seen aphasic patients as people who are not totally normal because they lack the ability to understand words. Dr Sacks saw aphasics as more gifted than normal people. Normal people get carried away by words. An aphasic cannot understand words. But he or she can still understand what is being said. For Dr Sacks, that was an indication of their superior sensitivity.He said most of the aphasics had this superior understanding.

They domesticated plant species by cultivation, ploughed the land and harvested the grain. That was the beginning of civilisation as we understand it.But, do you know that certain ant species were actually farming fungus years before humans learnt how to farm?For many millions of years, ants belonging to the attines group were farming and cultivating fungi in their anthill nests. They had actually domesticated various wild fungi!How did it all begin? The first ant to pick up a fungus perhaps accidentally discovered that the fungi growing on the bits of food were more nutritious than the food itself. The ant then started bringing in decayed leafs to feed the fungus and then to eat the fungus.Under the attini genera or group there are around 200 species of gardening ants. They are found largely in Central and South America.Illustration of ants on fungiThe attines are divided into lower and higher categories. The fungus-growing ants come in the lower category while leaf-cutter ants and several others form the higher category.The lower attines generally have smaller nests with a few hundred workers. They pick up dry and dead vegetation and use it grow their fungus. These include grasses, leaf-litter, the fæces of other insects, and dead insects themselves.The higher attines, on the other had, actually cut leaves from plants and feed their fungus garden. Their nests are larger, with thousands to millions of workers and they live in intricately designed nests.Both categories of the attines continue adding bits of fungus to their garden. The fungus growth in the garden may be as small as a golf ball or as large as pumpkins. Within a few weeks, they have fresh mushrooms (mushrooms, too, come in the category of fungus). These are not the actual mushrooms you see under trees, but are fungal tissues which are eaten by the ants.Just as humans develop new crop strains as the old ones get diseased, ants too gather new crop strains. They do it by going back to the original wild varieties of the crops and experimenting with them. These wild crop relatives help them survive in changing conditions.After an ant domesticates a fungus, that fungus changes genetically and becomes different from the wild variety. Sometimes the fungus dies or changes its genes, and when the ant disperses it, a new variety is formed. From the number and variety of genetic differences, scientists are able to predict how far back ants have been farming. And they have traced it to 15 million years ago!The attines and the fungi form a great relationship that is called symbiosis. Each is beneficial to the other. The ants provide food for the fungus, which they can’t eat themselves. The fungi feed on the plant parts, which get converted into proteins and sugars. These are in a form that the ants can eat. Thus the fungus is the attines’ best friend.Inside the garden, the ants chew leaves to make them softer and speed the growth of the fungus by adding decayed matter that acts like manure. They also weed out any rival fungi that sprout in the garden. Finally, the ants even help disperse the fungi. When a new queen leaves the nest to start her own nest she takes some fungus with her to create a new garden.","keyword":"[\"fungus\", \"attines\", \"fungi\", \"garden\", \"farm\", \"crop\"]","ALS":"23.444444444444443"},{"english_id":"502","id":"503","level":"4","topic":"3","title":"Do Whales and Dolphins see Blue?","article":"Dolphins and whales live in the deep blue sea, but strangely these animals are not able to see the colour blue!Leo Peichl of the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt and his colleagues discovered during routine tests that seals do not respond to the blue colour.

So, these lovable aquatic animals are not just seafarers’ friends, but they are also aware of their bodies – almost like humans!A Reuters news agency report in The Telegraph newspaper reports says that Presley and Tab stay in a pool with reflective glass walls in the New York Aquarium.Researchers in the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Osborn Laboratories of Marine Science noticed that when Presley and Tab saw their own reflections, they did not seem to think that they were looking at another dolphin.Dolphins are very social creatures, and are friendly with humans as well as their own kind. This got the researchers thinking. Perhaps the dolphins recognised their own images? So they decided to find out.Using non-toxic ink, they made marks on different parts of the dolphins’ bodies, changing the place every week. Every time their bodies were marked, the dolphins made more trips to the mirror than usual. If the ink mark was on their tummy, they would expose their tummy to the mirror and look at it for a long time.Now doesn’t that sound familiar? Imagine the dolphins wondering – “Now where did that mark come from? I wonder how long it’s going to stay?”Till now, only the great apes like the chimps, the gorillas and the orangutans have displayed this quality of recognising their images in the mirror. All other animals have failed this test.The researchers feel that these findings may increase human sensitivity towards dolphins, which are being hunted and slaughtered in great numbers. Dolphin fins are considered as delicacies in several South-East Asian countries.","keyword":"[\"dolphin\", \"mirror\", \"presley\", \"mark\", \"tummy\", \"recognise\"]","ALS":"26.928571428571427"},{"english_id":"508","id":"509","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"Elevator Physics","article":"You get into an elevator (or a lift, as we sometimes call it) and for a second or two, just as the elevator moves down, we feel weightless. On the other hand, if we go up in an elevator, we suddenly feel heavier just as the elevator lurches upwards.To understand this feeling of weightlessness, we need to understand a few basic things first.Mass: The amount of matter that constitues us results in our mass. Mass is the property which “resists” a change in acceleration (linear or angular). It is this “resistance” that results in inertia.Elevator PhysicsWeight (or Actual Weight): When gravity acts on matter (our body), you have a weight (actual weight). But this, theoretically, means that actual weight can only be computed when you consider all the gravities from all the different bodies in the universe acting on the mass. The sum of all these gravities is equivalent to the net gravitational force or the gravitational field (which is not necessarily the same as ‘g’ of the ‘free fall acceleration’). Actual weight only depends on the net gravity and the mass it is acting on.Apparent Weight: As opposed to actual weight, apparent weight is what your weighing machine shows you. When you are standing on a platform, and that platform is neither going up nor down with respect to the earth (whose gravitational field basically dominates every other graviational field), the platform pushes up against your feet in the opposite direction of the earth’s gravity. This “pushing you up” by the platform is what enables you to stand “on” the platform. Your actual weight is — always — gravity acting on your mass. But your apparent weight is the “opposite, pushing-up force’ applied by the platform. Therefore if you are standing on a weighing scale, this opposite force is what the weighing machine can measure.Weightlessness: This is actual weightlessness, and corresponds to actual weight — and this occurs when no gravity acts on your body’s mass, which is an impossible situation in the universe.Apparent Weightlessness: As opposed to actual weightlessness, apparent weightlessness occurs when your apparent weight zeros out. Now, if you remember, apparent weight was the opposite, pushing-up force applied by the platform or the weighing machine on which you were standing.However this opposite force is not always equal to the actual weight. When does such a strange thing happen? Here are two examples. Suppose you are floating in a tub full of water, and try to stand on a weighing machine on the floor of the tub. Though your actual weight remains unchanged, since the buoyancy of the water in the tub exerts an upward force on your body, you can no longer “press” down with as much force as earlier on the weighing machine. This is why the weighing machine will register a lighter apparent weight.In the second example, consider that the platform, on which sits the weighing machine, on which you are standing, begins to fall down at terminal velocity, so that you, the scale and the platform are all falling at the same velocity towards the earth. (For a definition of “terminal velocity”, please go to the end of this article). Now you can no more practically “press” down on the weighing machine, therefore it will register nothing. Your apparent weight has zeroed out and you are in apparent weightlessness. This is what happens to astronauts too in a spaceship orbiting the earth. However you still have actual weight.Conversely had the platform suddenly started climbing upward away from the earth, then you would “press” down harder on the weighing scale for a moment before all the velocities equalized, and the weighing scale would register a higher apparent weight. It’s not as if you really gained a couple of pounds by stepping into the elevator!!So the key concepts to grab are the definitions of weight or actual weight, and the meaning of apparent weight. An experiment on an elevator with a bathroom weighing scale can drive the point home.To conclude (quoting from wikipedia: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Apparent_weight ):An object’s apparent weight is equal to its actual weight, except if:• The object has an acceleration, as in a lift, a rocket or a rollercoaster.• Some force other than the earth’s gravity and the normal force is acting on the object. This may be buoyancy, magnetic force, or the gravitational force of another body.Terminal Velocity: The velocity when a falling object is no longer accerlerating; the force due to gravity is equal to the opposing force of air resistance.. When an object continues to fall steadily until air resistance becomes so great that it equals with the pull of gravity and the object can fall no faster.","keyword":"[\"weight\", \"platform\", \"gravity\", \"weighing\", \"weightlessness\", \"force\"]","ALS":"32.464285714285715"},{"english_id":"509","id":"510","level":"4","topic":"7","title":"Evergreen Clothes","article":"There is good news for those who love splashing around in rain puddles and don’t want to get their clothes dirtied. Or those who play soccer but don’t want their shirts to get soiled or wet with sweat. British scientists have created a fabric that never gets dirty or wet!The cloth is treated with a special non-sticky chemical that repels grease and water. This ensures that the clothes remain squeaky clean. But the scientists are not yet ready to make public the formula of this “miracle” chemical, says a report in ‘The Times of India’ newspaper.A well known French company recently launched a new range of jackets that have Teflon in them. Teflon is the plastic coating on non-stick pans that we use in our kitchens. The material has a special characteristic: it does not react to anything. It does not form bonds with other molecules, like grease or water. As a result, dirt and water slip away from the teflon fabric, as easily as a parantha slips out of a Teflon-coated pan.American scientists have gone a step further. They have integrated insecticide in the textile fibre that kills mosquitoes on contact. This new anti-mosquito fabric found immediate buyers.

Simple, put a teaspoon of tea into a boiling cup of water. Strain the water, pour some milk and sugar to taste and the tea is ready! Interestingly, everything that we prepare has a recipe and is made up of simpler ingredients.For example, what is sugar made of? It is made of sugar molecules, which in turn, are made up of atoms. The atom is the building block of all substances.The concept of the atom was first introduced by the Greek philosophers Democritus and Leucippus around 450-420 B.C. The word ‘atom’ comes from a Greek word that means ‘indivisible’. Infact, until recently, the atom was considered to be indivisible.3d model of an atomHow small is an atom?Atoms are very tiny, with diameters like one ten-thousand-millionth of a metre. So, approximately 50,000,000 atoms of solid matter like iron, lined up in a row, would measure one centimetre (0.4 inch).However, Carl Sagan in his book Cosmos says that if you cut an apple-pie into equal halves and further divide each half into smaller and smaller pieces, in about 90 cuts you will reach a single atom. But, there is no knife that can cut so fine. And the apple-pie would become invisible to the human eye in about 20 cuts.How do atoms create other substances?Two or more atoms join together to form a molecule. The molecule is the smallest part of a substance known as a compound. For example, when two atoms of oxygen combine with one atom of carbon, it forms carbon dioxide gas.These compounds group together to form bigger complex substances.What are atoms made of?Is there a recipe for the atom? Yes! As with every other thing, even the atom is composed of smaller particles. These particles are called neutrons, protons and electrons. They are necessary ingredients to make an atom.Scientists have also found substances which make up electrons and protons. So we have a recipe for electrons and protons as well.Everything around us is actually made out of something else, in an unending chain of ingredients and recipes.","keyword":"[\"atom\", \"recipe\", \"proton\", \"electron\", \"sugar\", \"molecule\"]","ALS":"21.944444444444443"},{"english_id":"513","id":"514","level":"4","topic":"14","title":"Footprints on Earth","article":"Have you ever been to a national park? If so, you must have tried to trace or locate a wild animal by trying to see its footprints on the soil. For example, people who go to Jim Corbett National Park, in Uttar Pradesh, India, spend most of their time looking for tigers. They do so by trying to look for its pug marks on the soil. If they find even one, they return happy and spin tall tales of adventure to their friends, about “How I saw a tiger”. We know because we have done it.Footprints on EarthWhile we humans try to locate wild animals through their footprints, Planet Earth quietly keeps a record of our footprints. Human footprints – of every individual, every community, every country. How, you may ask. Simple. The earth provides us almost everything that we need to live, eat, sleep, work, play, travel and entertain. Many of us manage to do all this in great comfort, especially in the cities. Of course, one has to have money to do all this, which more people in the cities have more of than anywhere else. The poor have a bad time even in the cities, be it regarding food, drinking water, sanitation, or shelter.To do all this, one uses up the earth’s resources – its land. Because some of us have more buying power, we end up using more resources than we actually need. We do it because we have unlimited desires and wants. What we need to ask is how much of the earth’s resources are we using up. We also create a great deal of waste and pollution. So we need to think how much land we use to dispose that waste.Two things happen. Vast sections of the world’s population get much less resources than they need to live with dignity. They live surrounded by dirt, disease, drought and famine, as Indians living in Rajasthan and Gujarat are experiencing. Secondly, the earth also undergoes a lot of wear and tear.Paw print of a royal bengal tiger at Sundarbans National Park, West Bengal, India.The amount of resources we use are like footprints. They show whose lifestyles are a burden on the earth and whose aren’t. The lifestyles of individuals as well as countries. For, the earth does not have unlimited resources. Because of the few who eat up most of the earth’s resources, the majority has to bear the consequences – like pollution. This is the ecological footprint that the earth keeps in its memory.Some years ago, a distinguished expert, called William Rees, developed this technique of the ecological footprint. Today, this technique has become like a magnifying glass. It allows us to see whether we are living lives in a way that keeps the earth in a reasonably good shape. Once the earth goes out of shape, there is no hope for living beings.Countries like the United States and Canada are the big gobblers and they have big ecological footprints. Rees calculated that the average amount of energy and materials consumed by a Canadian is the same amount as an area of 4.3 hectares can produce.India has a footprint of 0.4. This means that the energy and materials consumed by an Indian is the same as what 0.4 hectares of land can produce. But if we look carefully, we will find that within India, the footprints of the city Indian are much larger than the rural Indian. And if we look carefully, the urban rich Indian’s footprint may be even larger than the entire size of the poor Indian.","keyword":"[\"footprint\", \"resource\", \"earth\", \"indian\", \"ecological\", \"tiger\"]","ALS":"20.666666666666668"},{"english_id":"514","id":"515","level":"4","topic":"14","title":"Fox","article":"If there is one animal that lives by its wits then it is our very own Fox. Sheer ingenuity has made him a survivor literally. And it is due to its own dexterity that the Red or common fox is doing very well in Britain, North America and North Africa unlike it’s cousins the wolf and the wild cat. Man is his only enemy. Ironically though, he still prefers to stay close to humans.The fox is the smallest member of the dog family, Canidae. They are agile predators that usually weigh under 7kg. They scavenge carrion, wild fruits and hunt small rodents, rabbits, birds and invertebrates. They hunt small prey sufficient to feed only one animal and hence are solitary predators who do not hunt in packs.The male or dog fox marks out his own area and regards it as his own.Nocturnal by nature, foxes come out of hiding in the night after sleeping through the day in a hole in a sandy bank or some other hiding place under brambles and bracken. With a keen sense of smell, they can figure out the slightest movement.The dog fox and the vixen (female) look exactly alike. Their coat is thick and reddish or yellowish brown with creamy white hindquarters and underparts and a fine tail or brush which often has a white tip. Their ears, legs and feet are almost black. The cubs have shorter muzzles, dark brown wooly coats and little pointed tails. At three months old, they begin to look like their parents and before long wander off to find hunting grounds for themselves.The breeding season usually falls in winter. The vixen with her weird calls (which sounds like the scream of a peacock) announces the arrival of the season. This is a signal to all the dog foxes in the neighbourhood, who quickly make their way to her patch and fiercely fight one another, vying for the vixen’s attention. She may mate with more than one, but the courting season is brief.The vixen ceases to call and the dog foxes depart. The dominant male may stay in the area for a while, without sharing the earth or taking much interest in his mate.In about two months time, three, four or perhaps five cubs will be born, blind at first, snub-nosed and tiny, more like kittens than foxes. Their mother tends and suckles them at least for four weeks, leaving the earth only to find food. Then they begin to come out from the hole, to romp and play near the entrance while the vixen watches. Their mock fights are a good practice to hone their skills that they will soon need in the wild. The vixen brings them mice, beetles and worms to eat and at three months old they try catching things for themselves.Luckily for fox, his sense of smell is so keen that he can catch the scent of a man a long way off. Both sexes leave their own scent everywhere as well, partly by urinating on bushes and posts, partly through scent-glands in the pads of their feet. These scents enable hounds to follow the fox through fields and hedges, often for great distances. Without them they would never find his private paths and lairs, which he knows like a map and which are well hidden.The fox uses his wits, as usual, and as human populations increase and towns grow bigger he has discovered that that he can live quite well in the suburbs, where there are neither hunts nor gamekeepers and food can be snatched from dustbins and rubbish heaps.Many people living near towns or villages would be astonished to learn that the fox could be their friendly neighbour. He is so clever at keeping out of sight, so quiet, so cautious, that they would never believe that he goes through their dustbins in the dark, catches rats by their chicken run and spends the day in a secret lair not a stone’s throw away, curled up like a cat with his thick soft brush tucked snugly over his nose.","keyword":"[\"vixen\", \"scent\", \"foxes\", \"lair\", \"hunt\", \"dustbin\"]","ALS":"29.92"},{"english_id":"515","id":"516","level":"4","topic":"18","title":"Ginger, the New Wonder Medicine","article":"Ginger has always been an essential part of most Indian kitchens and grandmothers’ medicine boxes.

That is because it is on a region which has the highest altitude in the world. The Himalayan mountain range merges into the Tibetan plateau to form this region known as the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau.Besides being the roof of the world, this plateau also has a deep impact on the climate of the world, says a report published in the May, 2001, edition of Nature, a science and environment journal. How the scientists made this connection is a very exciting story.Winds and storms carry huge amounts of sand and dust from one region of the earth to another. Over millions of years, layers of such deposits gather on the earth’s surface, each distinguishable from the other.Yaks in the Tibetan plateau – Himalayas Have a Deep Impact on the Climate of the WorldSince the dust and sand carry the unique properties of the region it is carried away from, it can be studied to find out more about the region, such as its climatic conditions.These deposits provide a record of climate that can be read like the pages of a book. “You can dig down into these deposits and read the story of past climate,” says John E. Kutzbach, a climatologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Center for Climatic Research and a co-author of the paper published in Nature.By studying ancient dust deposits in China, the North Pacific and Indian Ocean, scientists from China and the United States have constructed a detailed portrait of the effects that Himalayan mountains and the great Tibetan Plateau have on the climate of Asia.They have established that the rise of the towering Himalayas and the adjacent Tibetan Plateau, were the primary driving force behind the Asian monsoons, which originated about 8 million years ago.They also suggest that this high altitude region may also have helped set the stage for the Ice Ages that began about 2.5 million years ago.Using a computer model, the scientists showed how the formation of the mountain and the plateau enhanced both the winter and summer Asian monsoons and gave rise to a drying trend in central Asia.The mammoth mountain chain has created a wall that has blocked rain from the central Asian plains of Mongolia for the past 8 million years. This has helped create the Gobi and Mongolian deserts. This drying up allowed loose and fine dust to be carried on prevailing winds from the deserts east to China and beyond where it left a record in both land and ocean sediments. These are the sediments that the scientists have used to piece together the sequnce of events during this period of Earth’s geological history.","keyword":"[\"plateau\", \"tibetan\", \"deposit\", \"region\", \"climate\", \"dust\"]","ALS":"53"},{"english_id":"520","id":"521","level":"4","topic":"11","title":"How Bad is the Sting of a Scorpion?","article":"Ever seen a scorpion scurrying across with two crab-like claws and its tail high in the air? Well this tail is what has to be watched out for! The zing in the scorpion is in its tail for it has a sting.Scorpions are poisonous animals. They are arthropods belonging to the class Arachnida and are relatives of the spiders and ticks. Though they are considered creatures of the desert, you can find them in most climates, hot or cold. They can be found in snow-covered peaks, in caves, in grasslands and forests. You can even find them in your homes.There are approximately 1,300 species of scorpions in the world. Scorpions have a long thin body and a tail that is marked by segments. At the tip of the tail is a tiny hooked sting. Just before the sting is a bulb-shaped structure that contains the venom or poison glands.Scorpions are nocturnal animals. They feed on a variety of insects, spiders, centipedes, and other scorpions. The larger scorpions occasionally feed on animals, such as smaller lizards, snakes, and mice.Scorpions have two pairs of pincer-like claws and four pairs of legs like other arachnids. The claws are called pedipalps. The claws are used to hold the prey while the scorpion lifts its tail and stings the prey.The sting is connected to the poison gland. The poison is used to stun and paralyse the prey and sometimes even kill the prey.How bad is the sting of a Scorpion?The pedipalps are also used for self-defence. The body of the scorpion has a carapace or head shield that bears a pair of main eyes and two or more pairs of lateral eyes. Scorpions detect their prey through vibrations. Fine sensory hair on their pedipalps and on the tips of the legs detect vibrations in the air and on ground.Depending on the species, scorpions give birth to live young ones within four months of mating to sometimes after a year. A female may give birth to between 20 and 30 baby scorpions. Once they are born, the mother assists the babies to climb on to her back.A week after birth the young scorpions get off the mother’s back and live on their own. The average scorpion lives for three to five years, but some may live longer.Despite their murderous reputation, few scorpions are truly dangerous to humans. Only 20 species across the world have venom dangerous to humans. Scorpions use their venom to stun and kill their prey or in self-defense. The venom is a complex mixture of poisons that affect the victim’s nervous system.Normally a scorpion sting produces severe pain and swelling at the site of the sting. The area becomes numb and sometimes leads to frothing from the mouth. Since it affects the nervous system, respiratory paralysis and convulsions follow. The cure for it is anti-venom.Although they are equipped with venom, scorpions themselves are preyed by other creatures, such as insectivorous lizards, owls and mammals like shrews and bats.","keyword":"[\"scorpion\", \"venom\", \"tail\", \"pedipalps\", \"poison\", \"claw\"]","ALS":"20.22222222222222"},{"english_id":"521","id":"522","level":"4","topic":"8","title":"How Can We Correct Crooked Teeth?","article":"Smile! A smile actually brightens up your entire face and is the most striking part of your face. But sometimes you are ashamed to smile. Why? Because you have buckteeth? Your teeth are crooked, stained? Have you seen some kids with a mouthful of metal? These are called braces.Today, doctors can work wonders with your teeth. They can straighten your teeth and put a sparkle on it. All this without dentures, mind you!Just as you go to a doctor with an upset stomach or an eye doctor to test your eyes, your teeth also requires attention and care. Teeth help in chewing.Mom and son smiling to show their colorful bracesCrooked teeth will not allow you to chew food properly so partially unchewed food will go down to your stomach. Crooked teeth are also hard to clean and they also hurt the gums. Gaps between the teeth are also dangerous.Sometimes food morsels get stuck between the teeth. If they do not get dislodged with a normal brushing they tend to decay the teeth and form cavities.The best way to correct these problems is when you are a child and your permanent teeth haven’t set. The dentist corrects the teeth by stretching your mouth so that the teeth fit in correctly in its place. This is done by means of braces.Treatment works best between 8 to 14 years of age. By 12 or 13 years of age the milk teeth falls out and permanent teeth come in. It is also at this age that the jaw is growing so it is usually the best time to get treatment.As a child is growing his jaws are still weak and reshaping is easier. Applying pressure to the jaw makes the jaw grow in the direction of the pull. Putting braces thus helps change the shape of your jaw.What are braces? These are metal pieces fitted into the mouth around the teeth to set them in order. They are attached to the teeth by means of bands, which are tightened periodically by the doctor.Braces or orthodontical brackets were first constructed by Pierre Fauchard in 1728. These braces consisted of a flat strip of metal, which was connected to teeth by pieces of thread. In 1841, bands were invented that consisted of a strip of metal with an adjustable screw.In 1915, a doctor called Edward Angle invented the orthodontic brackets. The brackets consisted of little hooks of metal attached to bands that covered the teeth. In 1928, the design was modified to made the edgewise bracket.Sometimes one of your jaws, mostly the upper one, is small and the lower one protrudes out. A special device is then fixed to make the jaws fit together.A closeup of dental bracesThe dentist uses a device called the palatal expander so the teeth and jaw fit together. Buckteeth are corrected by means of a clip-like device called a facebow. Other devices can correct irregular canines, teeth growing over another, etc.Teeth can be corrected at any age. However, as you get older the treatment takes longer and hurts more. The older you are the more painful it gets as the jaws and permanent teeth have set in. Certain people may even need corrective surgery.","keyword":"[\"teeth\", \"correct\", \"smile\", \"bracket\", \"metal\", \"brace\"]","ALS":"18.21875"},{"english_id":"527","id":"528","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"How Does Ice float?","article":"A cool glass of water topped with huge chunks of ice is sure to quench your thirst on a hot summer day. But, before you guzzle the water, look at how the ice floats on the water surface. How do these large ice pieces manage to stay afloat?Ice floats because it is less dense than water. (If you take a one-litre container with ice and weigh it, it will be lighter than a similar container with water.)How Does Ice float?Density : How dense it isAll materials are made up of molecules. These molecules are either bound tightly to each other or are loosely bound. This packaging of molecules is called density. The tighter the molecules, the higher the density of the material.Water flows because the molecules are loosely bound. When you heat water, the molecules go farther apart, converting water into a gas called water vapour.When you freeze water, the water molecules come closer and increase the density. But, this process stops after a point. If you freeze water beyond four degrees Celsius, the water molecules stop contracting and start moving apart. This is called the anomalous expansion of water.You can check this by filling a plastic jar with water and putting it in the freezer overnight. The next day, you will see that the jar has stretched (or even cracked) and the ice has extended beyond the point till which you had filled water.This happens because at four degrees Celsius, water molecules are packed as tight as possible and any attempt to push them closer (by lowering the temperature) only causes strain – the water molecules begin repelling each other and move apart.At freezing point, the molecules form a type of structure that has a lot of air gaps – making the ice much less dense than liquid water.  In other words, the density of water reaches a maximum at four degrees Celsius and lowering of the temperature only decreases the density.Since water freezes well below four degrees Celsius (at zero degrees Celsius), ice is less dense than water and so it floats.","keyword":"[\"molecule\", \"density\", \"celsius\", \"dense\", \"water\", \"degree\"]","ALS":"27.5"},{"english_id":"528","id":"529","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"How Does Satellite TV Work?","article":"Nine ‘o’ clock. It’s time for your favourite serial on television. Have you ever wondered how the same serial can be viewed by millions of people across the world?This is possible because of satellite television technology. It uses man-made or artificial satellites to send your favourite serial to your television set. But why do we need satellites for this purpose?How Does Satellite TV Work?The earth is roundTo understand this, we have to first take a look at the shape of our earth. Indeed, the earth is a sphere. This means if I were to send signals from one place to another on the earth’s surface, the signals would sooner or later get lost on the curved surface.This is the reason why radio and television towers are very tall. The taller the tower, the farther the signals go. Each tower gathers signals and beams them to the television sets which capture them using their antennas.However, making and maintaining these towers can be very expensive. Also, the area to which a television tower can send signals is small. This is why we need a satellite. It is used to send signals to television sets all over the world.A geo-stationary satelliteA geo-stationary satellite is one which remains fixed over a particular area on the earth’s surface. Actually, it rotates at the same speed as the earth. Hence, it appears to be fixed.These satellites are quite useful things. They can be used to beam a signal to any part of the earth’s surface. When you send a signal to it, it can reflect it back to the earth or transmit it to another satellite. This way, it can reach anywhere on earth.Television broadcasting companies convert television programmes into signals. These are then beamed to satellites, which, in turn, reflect it back to the earth, where they are gathered by dish antennas, installed by the cable operators. The cable operator then transmits these signals through the local cable network to your television.In this entire broadcasting process, satellites behave only as reflectors in the sky that gather and re-transmit television signals.","keyword":"[\"television\", \"satellite\", \"signal\", \"tower\", \"serial\", \"beam\"]","ALS":"20.842105263157894"},{"english_id":"529","id":"530","level":"4","topic":"15","title":"How Does a Helicopter Hover?","article":"It was January 26 and Rahul was terribly exited. And with good reason too. His father, a pilot in the Indian Navy, had been bestowed the rare honour of flying the newly acquired “Pawan Hans” helicopters for the Republic Day parade.Rahul couldn’t sleep the night before. He had already set his alarm clock to wake him up at 4 a.m., He wanted his mother to take him to the venue well before the scheduled time.Soon after the initial formalities of flag hoisting and the entry display of the various tableaus came the march past of troops from the armed forces.Royal Navy helicopter hovering close to land. msaunder1972 \/ Shutterstock.comSuddenly with an ear shattering roar flew the fighter planes, doing aerial acrobatics, amidst thunderous applause from the audience. Then came the moment Rahul was so eagerly waiting for. His father’s name was announced and he could see a helicopter come chattering towards them.The moment it reached above the dais of the President and the Prime Minister, the helicopter stood still in mid-air and showered flowers on the V.I.P guests.“Oh my God!,” thought Rahul, “What is papa doing?. . .He’ll fall down! After all how can something as heavy as a helicopter stand still in mid-air?”However, thankfully a few seconds later, the helicopter flew away without falling down from the sky. But Rahul was very angry with his father. He couldn’t wait to meet his father and ask him why he did that.Later, when his father explained why – Rahul felt very mollified and happy and proud of his father.His father explained that a helicopter is a machine that can fly in any direction: forward, backward, upward or sideward. It can even hover over a single spot. To understand how this is done, we must understand how a helicopter flies.A helicopter has two pairs of propellers – the larger ones at the front, above the cabin and a smaller one at the tail. The larger ones help in flying while the smaller ones stop the helicopter from spinning round when the big blades are turning.As the propeller blades of a helicopter slice through the air, it creates a strong wind. The wind moves downward pushing the helicopter. The air beneath the blades thus, has greater pressure than the air above them. The blades are then twisted slightly so that air is forced downward. This creates a lift.Flaps under the wings of an airplane create a lift in the same way. In fact, the rotor blades of the helicopter are really moving wings. The difference is that the whole airplane has to move forward in order to get lift, whereas the helicopter needs the propeller to fly in the air.This is what enables a helicopter to go straight up or down or hover over one spot. In front of the pilot, is a ‘cyclic stick’. He moves it in the direction he wants to go and the helicopter flies that way. The cyclic stick works by changing the pitch of one blade at a time as it passes the side of the helicopter.This means that one side of the rotor disc has more lift than the other, and the disc tilts. When the disc is flat, the helicopter hovers because all the lift force is straight up, keeping the helicopter in the air. If the disc is tilted, most of the force is still up, keeping the helicopter in the air, but some of the force pushes it and as a result the helicopter moves in the direction it is pushed into.Helicopters can make sharper turns than airplanes and they don’t need a long runaway to take off or land – they can even land on top of a building.In India, the armed forces use helicopters for many different jobs – because of their manoeuvrability, they are ideally used to transport people to places hard to reach easily: people trapped in jungles or mountains; patients to hospitals; or to rescue people in floods and landslides.In certain countries, helicopters are also used to monitor traffic conditions and by the police to catch criminals!That was it!

But it looks so very big. Is it the biggest star? No. The only reason the sun appears so big is because it is closer to us than any other star.The sun is just 93,000,000 miles (or 14,88,000,000 km) away from the earth. That seems an awful lot of distance, but light can travel so quickly that the sun’s rays reach the earth in a little more than eight minutes! That is the wonder of light.Many of the stars that we see at night, are more than 1000 times farther away than the sun. Obviously, this means that their light, too, would take 1000 times more time to reach the earth. And most stars are so far away that their light takes hundreds or even thousands of years to reach us.The distance travelled by light in a year, is called a light year (for those who have a head for figures, one light year is 58,780,000,000,000,000 miles).Therefore, if light takes 100 years to travel from a star to the earth, we say that the star is 100 light years away (100 x 58,780,000,000,000,000 miles.)Some of the stars we can see in the night sky are so far away that it takes thousands and thousands of years for their light to reach us.Scientists have only been able to see some nearby stars. One of them is Alpha Centauri, which is 4.35 light years away.Yet another star, Alpha Canis Majoris, or Dog Star, which is the brightest star in the sky, is 8.48 light years away.Giant spiral disk of stars, dust and gas is 170,000 light-years across. The spiral galaxy M101 is estimated to contain at least one trillion stars. [Cleaned and retouched image, original by ESA-Hubble]A look into the heavens or a plunge into the pastHere is something interesting to think about. If it takes 8.48 years for us to see the Dog Star, then doesn’t it mean that we are looking at it the way it looked 8.48 years ago? So, in that sense, aren’t we looking back into history?By this logic, if the Dog Star were to die today, when would we come to know about it? Only 8.48 years later, as we humans would continue to see the star till then.The deeper we look into the universe, the farther away we go both in time and space. And that is why scientists believe that if they could see the centre of the universe, then they would actually be able to see the events that led to the creation of the universe.So the next time you watch a movie by the name of Back to the future, you would surely know time travel is as simple as a peep into the night sky!","keyword":"[\"star\", \"alpha\", \"night\", \"spiral\", \"universe\", \"mile\"]","ALS":"31.41176470588235"},{"english_id":"536","id":"537","level":"4","topic":"16","title":"How Will our Sun Die?","article":"Everything that is born must die. Not only living beings, but inanimate objects like stars too.The birth of a starThe universe has massive clouds of hydrogen floating around. Sometimes, these clouds come together and form very dense and huge balls of hydrogen gas. As the clouds come close, their temperature increases. This is called a proto-star (original star).The increase in temperature triggers off nuclear reactions at the core of the star. Nuclear reactions inside the star occur when the nucleus of two hydrogen atoms fuse to produce a helium atom. This reaction which is actually the same as that inside a hydrogen bomb, release huge amounts of heat and light. This is what makes a star glow.Our sun is also a star and the heat and light we see is actually the burning of the hydrogen fuel in its heart.Like all things that are born, a star also dies. It dies when it runs out of fuel. It is a little like a car without petrol. But, the petrol tank in a car can be refilled. The star usually does not get a refill.And the death of a star is much more dramatic than a car without petrol.Solar Eclipse ‘Elements of this image furnished by NASA 'How will our sun die?Once the hydrogen inside the sun’s core is used up, the sun will expand rapidly. It will grow and grow till it reaches the earth’s orbit. And by then, it will be so hot, that it will consume the earth too.Such a huge star is called a red giant. Our sun will eventually become a red giant star some 5 billion years from now. And this will be the beginning of the final stages of its death. Slowly, the outer surface of the red giant will dissipate leaving behind a tiny, white and shimmering core called the white dwarf star.As the white dwarf star cools down, it will reach the final stage of its evolution and become a cold and inert heavenly object. This is often called the black dwarf and will be the final stage in the life of our sun.Whenever something dies, it creates something new. The death of the sun will create new substances which will form newer stars and newer planets. The entire universe is actually made of the ashes of dead stars.","keyword":"[\"star\", \"hydrogen\", \"dwarf\", \"core\", \"stage\", \"final\"]","ALS":"21.5"},{"english_id":"539","id":"540","level":"4","topic":"14","title":"How are Frogs Different From Toads?","article":"If you travel back tens of millions of years to the age of dinosaurs, you may possibly hear a rhythmic musical croaking from marshy ponds or even under your feet. And if you look closely you would probably find the common frog goggling away at you.Amazing isn’t it? Not many people know how ancient frogs are. Scientists have traced their ancestry to 200 million years and found that these animals haven’t changed in the least!Frogs are amphibians. That is, they can live both in water and on land. This gives them an advantage over other animals. If there is food scarcity or predators on land, they can jump into the water and if they want to catch juicy flies they can hop back on to land.Like other amphibians, frogs are cold-blooded and prefer to live in moist climates. This means that they can regulate their body temperatures with the surrounding temperature. If it becomes too cold, some frogs burrow underground or in the mud at the bottom of marshy ponds. They can survive in a frozen state for weeks and months.The red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) is native to rainforests in Central America.But is there a difference between frogs and toads? Technically, toads are frogs and both are classified under the order Anura. Under this group, animals with a dry warty skin with short hind legs are called ‘toads’, while animals with a moist skin and long strong hind legs for swimming and jumping are called ‘frogs’.However, scientists refer to this group as frogs as there is a very thin line separating the two. For instance, there are certain frogs with a warty skin while some toads have a slimy moist skin.Both have adapted themselves admirably to their environment. They are found in all continents, from deserts to mountains to the coldest region in the Arctic. Everywhere except Antarctica. The Indian Common Toad has been found in the Himalayas at a height of 8,000 metres (26,000 feet) and the same species has also been spotted inside a coal mine at a depth of 340 m (1,100 ft).On an average, a frog is more adapted to living on water. They have strong legs with webs between the toes to help them swim. Their two front legs have four toes each, while the hind legs have five toes each. Land dwelling and tree dwelling frogs have shorter hind legs to help them in walking or climbing. Tree frogs have large, round toe pads that have suction cups like lizards, to help them cling to branches or to wet and smooth surfaces.Some frogs can fly. Well, not exactly fly, but glide. The Malayan flying frog and the Indian flying frog use their webbed feet as a parachute to glide from a treetop to the base of another tree.Frogs are voracious eaters, eating anything they find from insects and shrews to worms and smaller fish. Some frogs are vegetarians like the Indian Green Frog that eats leaves or vegetable matter, while the Indian Bull Frog is reported to eat mice, birds, other frogs and even snakes!Both frogs and toads try to blend into the surroundings they are found in. And become near invisible among the leaves and marshes unless you look very closely. However, some frogs of Central and South America do not want to camouflage themselves and instead are brilliantly coloured in yellow, orange and red. This colouring is a warning to their natural enemies to avoid eating them, as they are sometimes poisonous.It is interesting to note that there are many non-poisonous frogs that try to bluff their way through with similar colouring. Since predators avoid attacking the poisonous frogs, these non-poisonous animals too escape.Though these creatures look ugly and repulsive, frogs are very useful to mankind as they eat insects, particularly mosquitoes and flies, that we consider pests. However, their most important contribution is the secretion of certain chemical compounds from their skin.Some chemicals were recently isolated from the skin of a South American frog which led to the discovery of a painkiller that is more powerful than morphine but less addictive.","keyword":"[\"frog\", \"toad\", \"moist\", \"warty\", \"dwell\", \"marshy\"]","ALS":"27.071428571428573"},{"english_id":"540","id":"541","level":"4","topic":"18","title":"How are Stars Named?","article":"Till now we have only seen roads, railway stations, airports, places etc. being named after famous people.

All you have to do is – go there, fill out the long, detailed form that they give you and buy star names or name stars after someone.However, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in France disapproves of this. It says that this practice is neither valid nor ethical. The IAU also dislikes these companies “selling” fictitious star names or “real estate” on other planets or moons in the Solar System. It says that though some stars have traditional Arabic names, most other stars have just catalogue numbers and positions on the sky.How are Stars Named?IAU explains that naming small groups of well-known bodies, like the planets or stars that can be seen by the naked eye, is fine. But there are hundreds of millions of stars. How can all be named? If they were all named, then finding any one star would be like trying to find Bank Street in India or Queen’s Road in Britain.

These gases are the main culprits behind the phenomenon of global warming and other climatic changes.In order to find cleaner fuels, scientists around the world are trying to find a fuel or source of energy which produces little or no pollution on being burnt.Quite amazingly, a new technology points out that water can be used to generate electricity. But burning water? How is that possible?How can We Use Water to run Cars?Split water, burn water, get waterActually, the idea is amazingly simple. Water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen. Scientists plan to make a cell (gadget which produces electricity by chemical reactions), which will break water down into its two components.Take a close look at any cell, you will see that it has two sides. One side is marked with a ‘+’ and the other with a ‘-'. The side with the ‘+’ is called the anode and the other is the cathode. The fuel cell is also like that. In this, the hydrogen is passed though the anode and oxygen through the cathode. With the use of a catalyst (something that enables a chemical reaction), hydrogen produces a stream of electrons. This stream of electrons is nothing but electricity.That is not the end of the story. When hydrogen reunites with oxygen it forms water all over again. Hence the end product of the electricity generation is pure clean water.Scientists plan to create a cell which will be able to convert water into water and in the process create electricity as well. They have named this cell, the fuel cell. Along with other uses it can also be used to drive vehicles. In fact General Motors has unveiled the Precept concept car which works on a fuel cell.Does that mean that we will soon be driving around in a vehicle that uses water instead of petrol to run it?

Actually, the pineapple is a group of tightly packed small fruits!How did the Pineapple get its Name?The pineapple is native of southern Brazil and Paraguay in South America. Native Indians spread this fruit, called Ananas, through South and Central America to the West Indies. In 1493, Columbus, on his voyage to the Caribbean, found the fruit on the island of Guadaloupe.To the European eye, this curious new fruit had an abrasive, segmented exterior like a pinecone and inside the fruit had a firm interior pulp like an apple. So combining the two they called it ‘pineapple’.In Europe, sweets and fresh tropical fruit were not common. These were imported at great cost from various voyages and expeditions. In such circumstances, this ripe yellow fruit, which was bursting with natural sweetness, made the pineapple a coveted fruit. It was such a luxury that King Charles II of England posed for an official portrait where he is seen receiving a pineapple as a gift! For many years after, rich Europeans carefully grew the pineapple in private greenhouses.Today pineapple fields exist in many parts of the world, including the West Indies, Florida, Northern Africa, Hawaii and Australia. The pineapple plant grows about 2 meter high with a spread of 3 to 4 ft. It is essentially a short, stout stem with a rosette of waxy, strap like leaves and bears its fruits at any time of the year. The leaves of the pineapple plant are also useful for they contain a fibre that can be made into cloth.Pineapples are grown from new vegetative growth. Home gardeners prefer the top or the crown of the fruit. The crown is removed from the fruit by twisting until it comes free. The bottom leaves are removed and the crown is left to dry for two days, then planted.Next time your Mom makes the “Oh!

Small fish use the tactics of the game to hide from bigger ones, while moths and butterflies use them to hide from birds and other attackers.A well-camouflaged rockfish is hard to discern from the backgroundSome creatures have colours that help them to merge with their surroundings, while others change their colour to do the same. This is known as camouflage.Butterfly camouflage: this butterfly merges with the bark of the treeThe wings of some butterflies, like the curve-toothed geometer, look like leaves. They even have leaf-like veins on them. This allows the butterfly to blend into the foliage on a tree without a trace. Similarly, a goatweed butterfly fades seamlessly into a leaf litter. Some species of tree frogs can change their colour to match the colour of the trees they are sitting on.Snake camouflage: A copperhead snake is hard to see when coiled among leaf litter on the forest floor.How does an animal change its colourAll living organisms are made up of tiny building blocks called cells. All the organs of our body like the heart, lungs and even the skin, are made of these cells. A certain type of these skin cells called melanophore cells carry small packets of colours called pigments. These impart colour to the skin.Chameleons are known for their quick color-changing abilities. But it is not necessarily for camouflage. Thy also use their color changing ability to signal their intentions to others and also to regulate their temperaturesThe green garden lizard owes its colour to the green pigment in its skin. These cells are controlled by the nervous system, which changes the concentration of pigments whenever needed. The colour changes depend on several factors such as the presence of light, temperature of the atmosphere, emotions like fright and a sense of danger.So, the next time you see a war movie and find the soldiers wearing green uniform and have leaves stuck to their uniform, you will know what they are trying to do.","keyword":"[\"butterfly\", \"colour\", \"cell\", \"camouflage\", \"pigment\", \"hide\"]","ALS":"26.5625"},{"english_id":"549","id":"550","level":"4","topic":"12","title":"How do Animals Communicate?","article":"Humans have invented new and advanced ways of communicating with each other.

Elephant researchers have discovered that there is more to such a mock charge than obvious to the eye.Foot stomping and low-frequency rumbling generate waves in the ground that can travel nearly 20 miles along the surface of the Earth, the article said quoting a study in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA).It is even more surprising to know that elephants may be able to sense these vibrations through their feet and interpret them as warning signals of a distant danger.

Well, this small reptile with a foot long body has an extremely long tongue. Its nearly three-fourths the length of its body!A chameleon can launch its tongue out at targets up to two body lengths away. It flicks its tongue and can snap its prey in 1\/25th of a second! This is faster than you can blink your eye!Once the tongue makes contact with a prey, the prey gets attached to the sticky tongue like glue. The chameleon then withdraws its tongue, with the prey firmly attached into its mouth. The chameleon’s sticky tongue is capable of gripping anything – sometimes even lassoing lizards nearly the same size as itself.How do Chameleons Latch on to Prey Using Just Their Tongue?Biologists have often wondered how chameleons manage to latch on to larger animals using just this sticky adhesive power. Chameleon tongues aren’t big enough, or for that matter, sticky enough, to bag big prey with mere adhesion.Recent research has revealed the secret of how a chameleon’s tongue sticks and grips its prey – the tongue latches itself on to its victims with suction. The muscles beneath the tip of a chameleon’s tongue, forms a flat pad at rest, but turns into a conical depression when in flight acting like a suction cup.A study carried out over an extended period of time was recently released in a Biology journal – the reaction of the chameleon’s tongue on a hollow straw and a sealed straw were observed.Since the former allowed air to enter – the suction effect was less obvious, however the chameleon clung with two-and-a-half times the strength to the sealed straw, due to airtight conditions.Ten species of chameleons from Africa and Madagascar were put through this test and the team of international scientists arrived at the same conclusion. Since the chameleon is not a very fast moving animal, its tongue’s ability to adhere to objects is essential for the survival of the species.Chameleons belong to the lizard family and are well known for their ability to change colours. This sudden change in skin colour occurs when the reptile is frightened, or in reaction to light and temperature changes.Hormones that affect special pigment-bearing cells in the skin cause the chameleons to ‘change colour’. Contrary to popular belief, the colour-change does not always match the surroundings.","keyword":"[\"chameleon\", \"tongue\", \"prey\", \"latch\", \"straw\", \"sticky\"]","ALS":"36.666666666666664"},{"english_id":"551","id":"552","level":"4","topic":"15","title":"How do Ducks Stay in Water and not Get Wet?","article":"When you get out of the swimming pool or bathtub, you are soaking wet.

At first it releases saliva and digestive juices over food and then sponges up the resulting solution. One can well imagine what we are eating after a fly are taken a ‘sip’ of our food.Because of the way they eat, flies contaminate large amounts of food.

A person enters a huge cannon and when the fuse is lit, he comes shooting out with a bang, flying in the air before landing on a net!My god! I thought that was the most horrifying thing I had ever seen. What a crazy thing to do. How does he do it without being blown to pieces, I would wonder.Though scary, it was one of the most captivating items for me, and the hundreds of children and adults who would watch the circus item with their mouths open.Then the questions came cannoning into our minds: how does the human cannonball fly? How can this man not be blown to pieces when that cannon fires? Was there a catch somewhere?Yet, the cannon was real as we kids went and touched it. It was only recently that I interviewed a circus clown and got the answer to this childhood mystery.The cannonball run is more or less equal to the girl who is cut into two by a knife in a magic trick. The danger of a mishap is there but hours of practice have made the trick perfect.For trick is what it is. Human cannonballs are not blasted into space from the cannon with gunpowder. They’re shot into space, catapulted with the help of compressed air. The loud bang, flash and smoke are supplied by fire crackers that makes you believe that the cannon was fired!How do human cannonballs fly?The first human cannonball was a woman called Zazel who performed this trick on April 2, 1877 in London. Zazel used hidden coils of springs and enthralled the audience. The released springs propelled the ‘ball’ in the same principle that works with the pogo stick.Soon, others, too, caught up and various devices were tried out and used.Today, those who do the trick prefer to use compressed air to propel the human cannonball. The ‘cannonball’ climbs into the cannon. Inside the cannon, at the bottom, is a cylinder holding compressed air.When compressed air is released, the cylinder moves forward, propelled like a bullet that stops just short of the mouth of the cannon. The ‘ball’ is shot forward due to the momentum of the cylinder and lands about 100 feet away on to a net.This is an extremely dangerous sport and like any other risky action venture, it has a high accident rate. Though the distance that the human cannon is estimated to travel is measured and a net is tied across, sometimes the ‘ball’ does overshoot or fall short due to human error.It happened once with two human cannonballers. They were launched simultaneously from two opposing ends. However, instead of passing each other by in this daredevil act, they collided in mid-air and one of them ended with a broken back.Even if accidents can be avoided with excess precaution, the force at which the person is projected at such speeds cause blackouts that doctors worry may lead to brain damage.This sport is still popular in the United States as seen from the Discovery channel coverage. Stuntmen perform at select venues and even try to set world records in how much distance they can cover.","keyword":"[\"cannon\", \"cannonball\", \"trick\", \"human\", \"circus\", \"propel\"]","ALS":"28.285714285714285"},{"english_id":"556","id":"557","level":"4","topic":"2","title":"How do Humans Balance on Two Legs?","article":"Four-year-old Rohit couldn’t understand why his parents and grand parents were so happy on seeing his 10-month-old sister, Ruchi, take a few unsteady steps towards her favorite toy.

That is one reason why we get tired when we stand for long. Our muscles are constantly at work. In fact, standing is work.While walking, we not only use our balancing trick, but we also make use of two natural forces to help us. The first is air pressure. Our thighbone fits into the socket of the hip joint so snugly that it creates a sort of vacuum. The air pressure on our legs helps keep it there securely. This air pressure also makes the leg hang from the body as if it has very little weight.The second natural force we use while walking is the pull of the earth’s gravity. After our muscles have raised our leg, the earth pulls it downwards again, and it keeps swinging like a pendulum.So next time you see an acrobat walking across a tightrope and balancing himself, remember he is doing a more difficult trick of balancing than you do every day. And like you, he had to learn and practice it for a long, long time.","keyword":"[\"balance\", \"trick\", \"teach\", \"rohit\", \"walk\", \"stand\"]","ALS":"28.4"},{"english_id":"557","id":"558","level":"4","topic":"2","title":"How do Nails Grow?","article":"Put your hands face down and look at the fingernails on your hand. Are they long or short? Dirty? Covered with polish? And the nails on your toes? Are they tearing up your socks? When my nails do that to my socks I know that it is time to get hold of a nail trimmer to cut them down to size.Meanwhile, my sister wants to show hers off. So she spends hours every day polishing her nails endlessly. She wants to look different. But whatever people do to their nails – paint them, cut them, grow or colour them – yours, hers, mine and everybody else’s nails are made of the same material called keratin.Keratin is the same protein that makes up hair and the outer layer of the skin. Nails look as if they grow only from the tips of the fingers or toes and this is the portion, which we cut or trim.But in fact, nails start growing from the nail bed, a small surface that is just below where your nail disappears into your fingers or toes. Like hair, nails, too, are attached to tiny blood vessels that feed it.The anatomy of a human nailThe blood gives the nail the pale pink colour and when you press the flesh of your fingertip, you can see the nail becoming pinker and pinker as blood rushes in below it.Nail cells multiply under the skin. Each cell keeps dividing and creating more cells. The new cells push the old cells above the skin surface.Once the nail cells are out on the surface, they are pushed from below by new nail cells, towards your finger or toe. However, once they come out they lose the ability to multiply. They become dead cells.Nails grow very slowly – and fingernails grow faster than toenails. The root of the nail where it appears on your skin is called the cuticle. Cuticles help to protect the new formed nail and the nail bed. At the tip where the nail comes out of the skin is a whiter half-moon shaped structure called the lunula.Nails protect the fingertips and toes and help you grab things.Multicoloured nails of a young woman.They need to be trimmed weekly. When you play or scratch, tiny particles of dust and dirt get under the nail and skin. This may mix with your food if you do not clean your hands properly, and cause diseases.Biting or chewing nails is a common habit, but it could lead to an infection. Sometimes people are forced to work with paints, chemicals, or oil. They should be careful as chemicals weaken the nails.Similarly, the nail polish removers that are commonly used can also weaken the nails, so one must always be careful when using them.When trimming nails, one must be careful to trim it straight. If nails are cut in a curve, the edges tend to poke through the skin and flesh. This causes a painful condition especially in toes called in-grown nails. When this happens surgery may be necessary to help ease the pain.Nails normally get broken off if grown over a certain length. However, the record in nail growth is held by an Indian from Pune, called Shridhar Chillal. The nails of his left hand measure a total of 242 inches.Chillal’s thumb nails are the longest at 56 inches! He hasn’t cut his nails since 1952 and takes great care to see that they remain unbroken.","keyword":"[\"nail\", \"cell\", \"polish\", \"trim\", \"careful\", \"nails\"]","ALS":"21.79310344827586"},{"english_id":"559","id":"560","level":"4","topic":"6","title":"How do Spiderwebs Help Skydivers?","article":"While dusting the house have you ever cross jhalis (webs) in the corners of the wall? Sometimes you may come across them under table corners or at rarely used places. Yes, the webs are woven by spiders.It’s a nuisance clearing them for just when you manage to remove one sticky web, the spider scurries off to a corner to spin yet another!But before you destroy these webs with a sweep of the broom, here’s some food for thought – you are about to dismantle one of the strongest structures in the natural world!Once caught in a spider web, even insects that are larger and stronger than spiders cannot escape from these silken threads. Spiders are very useful creatures around the house as they trap flies, mosquitoes and other pests in their webs and eat them.However, when a web gets wet it can shrink to as little as 55 per cent of its original length. Now, for a spider that is good news since old droopy webs will self-tighten when it rains.Scientists and researchers have tried to work on the same principle to design parachutes of super strong spider silk. But they were going nowhere, for while such a parachute would be incredibly strong but at the same time lightweight, a jumper unfortunate enough to get caught in stormy weather would plunge to his death as the silk would shrink!Dew drops on a spiderwebMeanwhile, new research by American scientists doing a chemical analysis of spider silk revealed that the most probable cause of shrinkage was a certain arrangement of 11 molecules known as amino acids.The team then managed to figure out a similar string of molecules that could replace the amino acid block, thus resulting in a silk that’s just as strong but not as water sensitive as to shrink.Skydivers in mid air formationBut this is rather complicated and will involve inserting the required arrangement into the spider – a process known as genetic coding.Perhaps in the near future we shall soon see spiders and humans working together, the spider spinning its silk and the human weaving it to make a parachute.","keyword":"[\"spider\", \"silk\", \"parachute\", \"corner\", \"shrink\", \"amino\"]","ALS":"64"},{"english_id":"560","id":"561","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"How do they Make an Igloo?","article":"To many of us, building a house of ice doesn’t sound too good. One might wake up from a good night’s sleep to see it melted. All these things don’t matter to Eskimos, who live in north Canada, Greenland and Alaska. They build igloos or houses of ice knowing that they will not melt. At least, not till winter passes by. The reason is that the walls are made in a special way so that they become rock hard.How do they Make an Igloo?Building an igloo takes about a couple of hours. It is made in the shape of a dome. First, they cut a trench or pit. It is about 1.5 metres long and 50 centimetres deep in the snow. Then they cut blocks of snow from the trench and place it around the trench in a circle. These blocks are shaped in such a way that they lean inward when one is kept on the other. Their edges are trimmed so that the circumference slowly reduces, forming a dome-shaped structure. The blocks are cut from the inside of the house as the man works. Then a big block, which is wider than the rest, is put on top. All the cracks are filled with soft snow.After the main structure has been built, the woman gets into the house and lights a lamp. She lets it burn till it is really hot. Then she closes the door with a block of ice making the structure airtight. This way the lamp’s heat is trapped inside and the snow begins to melt. But, because the dome’s roof is curved, it does not drip. Instead, it gradually soaks into the blocks so that they become wet.How do they Make an Igloo?When the blocks are sufficiently wet, she puts out the lamp and opens the door, letting in a gush of cold air. This draught of biting cold air freezes the melting snow and the fragile structure made of ice blocks becomes a strong dome of ice. It becomes so strong that a polar bear can crawl on it without breaking it.","keyword":"[\"block\", \"igloo\", \"snow\", \"dome\", \"trench\", \"lamp\"]","ALS":"18.136363636363637"},{"english_id":"561","id":"562","level":"4","topic":"7","title":"How does a Juggler Juggle?","article":"Yesterday, after seeing a circus show, I made up my mind about a career. I was at home busy throwing an orange in the air with one hand to catch it while the other hand was passing me a second orange. I wanted to juggle oranges the same way a clown juggles balls.I could manage it with two. But my hand started to fumble when it came to the third. The clown we saw yesterday was throwing plates in the air and I knew my mother would kill me if I broke any!A clown juggles ballsJuggling is something one sees at a circus. It is a performing art and quite difficult as I soon found out. So how do people master this art? Down the ages, there have been jugglers. In fact ancient Egyptians used to have jugglers. In a tomb unearthed at Egypt, there are pictures of a juggler dating to the Middle Kingdom period, roughly 1994 BC to 1781 BC (more than 3,700 years ago.)In the 20th century, studies have been conducted to understand the art of juggling. In the 1970s, researchers at the world-famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in America, investigated how people master the art of juggling. The MIT juggling club, one of the oldest organisations devoted to juggling, was established.A juggler juggles large knives while another artist lays flat in the path of a possible miss. Avignon Theater Festival in Avignon, France. sansa55 \/ Shutterstock.comAll amateurs start with juggling two or three balls in a “shower” or circle pattern with one hand throwing and the other catching. However, it is far easier to learn juggling if they attempt it by throwing the balls alternately with both hands in the “cascade” or the figure eight pattern.Depending on one’s skill, it may take hours or days to learn to juggle three balls. The time increases to months to move on to four balls and years to master five or more object!Someone has even set a world record in juggling: 12 rings, 11 balls and eight clubs. Actually it is easier to juggle rings and balls than clubs as the weight and grip also affects the rhythm of the thrower.The main drawback is gravity, which limits the number of objects one can juggle at a time. Each object (ring, ball, club, plates, knives, etc) must be thrown high enough to allow the juggler time to deal with the other objects. The more the objects, more the height and speed necessary to keep it in the air.Errors in timing the object or in throwing are the most common mistakes a juggler makes. If thrown low, the catch must be quick and it doesn’t leave time to correct mistakes. A higher throw does give more time but it also effectively shows up the mistakes you make to the audience.Professionals use the low-throw technique. These jugglers also tend to concentrate on the object at its highest arc of the throw. They are thus, able to judge where and when the object would land. Any subsequent errors in the throw must therefore be anticipated in the catch.To start with, one can start with bounce-juggling. You can bounce balls off the floor and catch it rather than throw it in the air. This is easier as the balls are caught at the lowest speed.So, now that you are better informed on juggling, try it out. You only stand to miss a few balls. However, don’t try oranges as I found to my cost.

This makes the mug float. Similarly, a submarine has huge tanks called ballast tanks. The air in them allows the submarine to float.How does a Submarine Work?When a submarine has to dive, the ballast tanks are filled with sea water. This makes the submarine heavy and it sinks.When the submarine has to resurface, the water is pumped out of the ballast tanks and compressed air is forced in.

It has about 500 different varieties. They all have smooth, hollow jointed stems with a strong watertight partition at each joint. While most flower every year, there are some that flower only three or four times in a 100 years.Their flowers are like that of grains or grasses.

In certain parts of south Asia and south east Asia, tender bamboo shoots make an important food item.**House of bamboo** The matured bamboo stems are used to build entire houses.

This is almost half of the total amount of solar energy (heat of the sun rays) falling on such an area in a year. So New Yorkers, in effect, live under a sun-and-a-half.In addition, paved areas, walls and the roofs of buildings absorb and re-radiate more heat than soil or plant-covered ground. Water runs off these surfaces more rapidly, allowing little cooling by evaporation. And the heat is produced by the bodies of the people themselves and leaks out of every building.This interesting fact comes from the ‘Woodpecker volume 2000’, which carries interesting facts on the state of the planet and is brought out by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehradun, in north India. Creating environmentally sustainable technologies at the local level is its main concern.Aerial view of skyscrapers at night around Times Square, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.On a normal day, the air temperature in a city like New York is higher than its surrounding areas, says the Woodpecker volume. Scientists call these cities “urban heat islands.”If New York becomes this hot, it should have been burnt to a cinder long ago. What saves the city year after year from cooking itself to death?To find an answer to this, let us try and understand the way our body keeps itself cool.Our bodies are like hot electric irons, without an electric supply of course! Our bodies absorb heat from the sun and the environment. The process of digestion heats up the body further. And just like any other body, overheating can be dangerous.So what does our body do to counter this heat? We sweat. The evaporation of sweat, caused by the wind blowing over the surface of our skin, takes the heat away and cools our body down.The city of New York keeps itself cool by using the same phenomenon. What saves the city are strong winds. As the city becomes hot, the air also heats up substantially. Since hot air is lighter than cold air, it rises up, leaving behind a space with low air pressure.All it takes is a Force 6 wind once in a while to eliminate the heat island effect altogether.A Force 6 wind, according to the Beaufort Scale that measures wind velocity on a scale till 12, is a strong breeze that blows 40-50 kilometres per hour. When the wind moves over the seas, it get cooler and replaces the hot air of the city.In effect, these winds act as giant coolers that drive cold air of the seas to replace the hot air over the land. This makes the city cool and hence habitable.","keyword":"[\"heat\", \"york\", \"wind\", \"city\", \"cool\", \"evaporation\"]","ALS":"28.055555555555557"},{"english_id":"571","id":"572","level":"4","topic":"6","title":"Is Tomato a Vegetable or a Fruit?","article":"We think the tomato is a vegetable, but it is actually a fruit.

Astronomers seem to think it does.Last year, astronomers at the University of Arizona and a Massachusets Observatory discovered what looked like a new moon around Jupiter. They had been scanning the skies for comets and asteroids as part of a spacewatch programme. In fact, when they saw the new moon, they thought it might be a comet or an asteroid.A comet is a small body of ice and dust that orbits the Sun. When it approaches the Sun, the ice in it vaporises and forms a head and a tail. This object around Jupiter looked nothing like one, though it moved in an elongated orbit like a comet. It looked even less like an asteroid, which is a small rocky body that orbits the Sun. In the solar system, asteroids exist in a wide belt between Mars and Jupiter.Jupiter’s New MoonIf the new object was neither a comet nor an asteroid, what was it? The scientists were in a fix. They realised what it was only only last month when they observed its orbit.The orbit is the path that every object in the solar system takes while revolving around another object. And every object has a particular kind of orbit. Asteroids have one. Moons have another. Planets have yet another. It is possible to say what exactly an object in the solar system is by calculating the number of days it takes to go round its orbit. When the scientists made the orbital calculations of the new object, they realised it was not an asteroid, nor was it a comet. It was actually a new moon around Jupiter that had not been noticed before.But, the scientists are still not sure, and they will not be for a few more months. For, Jupiter and its moons are too close to the Sun right now. And, that is why the scientists have not assigned a permanent name for the moon. It is still known by the number it was allotted when it was first discovered — S\/1999J.The new moon has a diameter of only 5 km, which means that the walk from one end of the moon to the other is only 5 km. It is Jupiter’s smallest moon. Actually, it is the smallest moon in the solar system.Before the new moon was found, the Jupiter’s smallest known moon was Leda, which is about 8 to 16 km. in diameter.This is not the first time that one of Jupiter’s moons is causing a stir. Some time ago, it was found out that one of its biggest moons, Io, actually does a lot of stirring and shaking. In the entire solar system, it is the only moon which is more volcanically active than earth.For all we know, the new moon may not be the last of Jupiter’s moons.

The name mango comes from Tamil. From man-kay or man-gay, it changed to manga. The people who gave it the name manga or mango were the Portuguese. They first came to India, across the oceans, about 500 years ago. As they settled down in parts of India, they discovered the mango. They seemed to want more of it so they started experimenting with new varieties of mango — the famous Alphonso or Mulgoa that we cherish today, is the result of their hard work.And then they decided to introduce the fruit to the rest of the world.A fruit enjoyed since 3000 yearsImagine, while Indians have been talking excitedly about the fruit for 3000, yes 3000 years, the western world has savoured it for only 300 years!But how do we know that Indians have enjoyed the mango for 3000 years? Simple, they were excited enough to actually write about its good qualities in books. Not any other book, but the Upanishad — the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad. (Today we all know that the mango is rich in vitamin A, C and D) . It was mentioned by various names such as amra, chutha, rasala and sahakara.Down the ages, several qualities have got attached to the mango. It is seen as a symbol of good luck and in many parts of west and south India, mango leaves are put up at the front door. It is a belief that the mango tree has the power to make wishes come true. The mango tree is also associated with the god of love “Manmatha’; its blossoms are considered to be the god’s arrows.

Based at the University of California, SETI’s goal is to examine the radio signals coming from nearby stars. Researchers involved in the project believe that a large number of stars in the universe could have planets orbiting around them. And they want to know if these planets have conditions suitable to sustain life forms.How does the project work? There is a huge radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. It catches these radio signals, which are then fed into SETI computers. The telescope has a bowl-shaped dish which is 1000 feet in diameter. That makes it the world’s largest stationary radio telescope. The researchers have to analyse thousands of radio signals daily. They are looking for signals whose patterns would show the existence of hydrogen or water molecules that sustain life on Earth. They could be at it for years before showing a single positive result!Of course, even the researchers know that they cannot do a fast job on their own. So they are distributing the workload.

I crawled under a leaf of the plant. With my head hanging down, I spun a pad of silk and soon fastened myself to the pad.Ah! Look! It was a yellow orange bag that I spun. A warm, cosy and beautiful bag. My mother told me that I was a pupa and must rest at this stage.The very next day the yellow-orange bag turned into a shining silvery one with black trimming. This was my silver cascade.It was the eighth day of my pupal stage. My silver cascade took a blue tinge. Then, it all happened very soon.The silver cascade turned bluish blackAt first, two little feet came out of the cascade. Then two more……and finally two more.Finally, it’s me with six feet and four wings like my mother.My wings looked wet and crumpled. I rested for a while. Then I began to fan my wings up and down. Soon my wings became large and beautiful.Now, I am a full grown butterfly kid. Fluttering my wings, I fly happily saying good bye.I am full grown.First published by National Book Trust, India","keyword":"[\"cascade\", \"silver\", \"flutter\", \"mother\", \"butterfly\", \"pretty\"]","ALS":"15.923076923076923"},{"english_id":"589","id":"590","level":"4","topic":"14","title":"Paris is Bugged by Termites!","article":"Recently Parisians have been facing quite a bit of trouble; bookshop owners live in mortal terror of their precious books disintegrating, while owners of wooden houses are constantly worrying that their homes might collapse into a pile of rubble.Strangely enough, the cause of all this problem is really teeny. In fact the culprit that has most of Paris, France, upset is able to squeeze through an opening as small as 1\/32 of an inch! Not so terrifying after all, but then these creatures live in gigantic colonies – consisting of more than a million members and love munching on wood and paper.Yes, these havoc-causing critters are the common termites. It is estimated that these bugs have now conquered two thirds of the city and the number of termite-infested houses is put at between 1,500 and 2,000. Besides, many of the city’s trees, wooden buildings, and in particular bookshops, are at great risk.Termites have been around for over 250 million years and although they look similar to ants, these insects are more closely related to cockroaches. Unlike the common cockroach, termites lead more complicated lives and have an extended social set-up earning them the nickname, “social cockroaches.”Termites live in colonies or termitaries. These range in size from several hundred to several million individual members. A single colony consists of workers, soldiers and the reproductives (the termites that breed, of which the King and the Queen are the most important).The workers build the nest and provide food for all colony members. The soldiers protect the colony, while the King and Queen ensure a constant supply of eggs.In many species, egg production may approach 30,000 eggs per day. Termite Queens live up to 15-25 years and are capable of laying an egg every 15 seconds! Both the king and the queen are longer-lived than other termites, and the queens are larger than other members of their colony.In certain tropical species, the queen grows to an enormous size, sometimes as much as 20,000 times the size of the worker.Paris is bugged by termites!Worker termites are small, creamy white insects and these are the termites that nibble pages and bore through wood. Incredible as this may sound worker termites never sleep and work 24 hours a day.Phew! Of the 2000 known species of termites, most are distributed in tropical countries and all have soldiers with greatly enlarged heads. The soldiers of certain species have with huge jaws for defence of the colony while in some species, the soldiers have long snouts, from which they eject a poisonous substance to kill enemies.The reproductives are dark-colored males and females with fully developed wings. At maturity, they leave the parental nest to mate. A new colony is established by the male and female who then become the king and queen of that particular colony.The common termites, found in households and buildings, build nests on the ground and construct mud tubes along foundation walls in order to attack nearby objects. These insects can enter buildings through cracks, microscopic gaps between brick and through pipes.So if you have not termite-proofed your wood, look out for mud or sand lining your doors or walls and prepare yourself for an invasion of paper snatchers for termites can destroy all paper and riddle your woodwork until it looks like a sieve.","keyword":"[\"termite\", \"colony\", \"queen\", \"soldier\", \"worker\", \"bookshop\"]","ALS":"35.588235294117645"},{"english_id":"591","id":"592","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"Penguin Sweaters","article":"Oil spills can have a devastating effect on marine life. After an oil spill, one of the most important jobs of rescuers is to fish out oil soaked birds and animals, clean them and rehabilitate them before releasing them into the wild again.Recently, after an oil spill in the Australian waters, environmentalists claimed that the oil slicks were threatening the existence of the little blue penguins in the south of Australia.These tiny, blue-backed penguins are barely 41 centimetres in height – half the height of the world’s biggest, and famous Emperor penguins of Antarctica.A penguin has shiny feathers that are coated in natural oils which make it waterproof and keep the bird warm in the icy waters. Crude oil from a spill destroys these natural oils and the bird fails to protect itself from the cold. And, since it preens its feathers using its beak, it is liable to swallow poisonous oil and die.During rescue operations, after a minor spill, officials at the Phillip Island National Park (South of Australia) hit upon a unique method to keep the penguins warm and prevent them from swallowing the deadly oil.And, all it took were a few knitting needles and yarn. Yes, the rescuers actually dressed up the rescued penguins in tiny sweaters, such that only their heads and flippers stuck out.The designs of these special penguin sweaters were uploaded on the net and countless people from different parts of the world sent sweaters for these tiny birds.Of course, if you visit Phillip Island, you are not likely to see penguins waddling around in sweaters. This clothing is used only when a penguin has just been rescued from an oil slick. Once the penguins are cleaned and dressed in the sweaters, they are put in salt-water pools for rehabilitation.As they swim around and regain their strength, the salt water gradually destroys the wool. By the time, the penguins are ready to return to the ocean, their natural oils are restored and they go home dressed only in their feathers.","keyword":"[\"penguin\", \"sweater\", \"spill\", \"dress\", \"rescuer\", \"slick\"]","ALS":"45.875"},{"english_id":"592","id":"593","level":"4","topic":"8","title":"Peppermint to Chase Mosquitoes Away","article":"Padma Vasudevan, a scientist from India’s capital, Delhi, has made an important discovery.

A recent report in the journal ‘Science’ says that environmental pollution is as old as human existence itself, though industrialisation certainly hastened the process.The report is based on a study consisting of the combined research of 19 scientists across four continents, who found that the diversity of marine life was among the first to be affected. Entire species of animals were killed. This created an imbalance in the ecological chain as certain species decreased rapidly while some other species increased their numbers.The list of hunted sea creatures as far back as 10,000 years ago, is impressive: sea turtles in the Caribbean, sea cows off the Australian coast, and sea otters near Alaska. Since the sea animals came ashore regularly to lay eggs, they were an easy catch.Pollution – an old ancestral legacyWhile there’s no getting away from the fact that “modern” forms of waste and pollution have led to much higher levels of environmental degradation, today’s generation can take heart from the fact that they are only following in their ancestors’ footsteps – and learning to be a step ahead of them!The extent to which we have overtaken our predecessors becomes evident from these alarming facts:Over India, dust particles are found at a height of over 20,000 feet above the ground.In the bodies of Indians, DDT is present in almost twice the quantities present in those of Americans, which in turn is twice the level found in those of the British.Lead is present in the Pacific Ocean as well as in the air above it, in amounts many times the pre-industrial level.It is impossible to take a 50-gallon sample of water from the sea anywhere in the world without finding measurable amounts of man-made radioactivity.","keyword":"[\"environmental\", \"pollution\", \"waste\", \"level\", \"industrialisation\", \"hasten\"]","ALS":"68.8"},{"english_id":"596","id":"597","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"Roach Sense","article":"Have you ever caught a glimpse of a cockroach scurrying across your kitchen floor? Well, by the time you manage to get your hands on a roach repellent, the cockroach would have disappeared. Not surprising really, considering you are dealing with one of the greatest escape artists in the insect kingdom.Yes, cockroaches or roaches for short, are adept at wriggling out of tight spots. Whether it is a frog lurking behind a bush, or a descending broom, these creatures have an uncanny ability to scent danger. That’s how they have survived on earth for the past 320 million years!There are about 3,500 known species of roaches found worldwide, yes, even in the North and South poles. Of these, only 30 species have an inclination to live with people. These include the American, German, Oriental, brown-banded, and Madeira cockroaches.Cockroach scurrying acrossBut how do they sense danger? Is it with their antennae or is it something like a sixth sense? A recent study carried out by American scientists shows that roaches use something more tangible to detect danger – their hair. According to scientists, tiny hairs on a roach’s back act as sensors and are designed to bend easily. These hairs are oriented in all possible directions and can sense changes in wind movement – from all sides.Cockroaches are very, very sensitive to minute changes in air movements. Subtle shifts in wind patterns bend the hair in a particular direction. This signal is sent to the nerve cells. The cells process the information and guide the cockroach to take evasive action. All this takes place almost instantaneously.The cockroach differentiates between regular wind patterns and the kind of slow-moving air that signals the approach of an attacker. Normal wind flow creates mixed-up swirl patterns. However, the movement of a foot, (or the approach of a frog) generates a smoother, slower wind pattern.For example, the moment you take aim with a shoe from behind a roach, the insect senses a slight change in the wind pattern from behind, as the hair on its back is pushed forward. It immediately darts off in the opposite direction.However, vacuum cleaners have even smart roaches fooled. Vacuum cleaners suck in air, so when the vacuum nozzle is pointed at the back of a cockroach, the air blows from the roach’s head towards its back and into the nozzle – causing the hair to get pushed backwards. The roach thinks that the wind is blowing from the front (towards it) since the hair sensors are being pushed backwards and quickly turns around and runs straight into the nozzle!Most roaches are sensitive to light and try to hide. However, certain Asian species and the American cockroach are attracted to light. Roaches may be winged or wingless, but not all winged species fly.Cockroaches can live without food for a month, but can only survive a week without water. As such, a cockroach can live a whole week without its head! Without a mouth the roach can’t take in water and finally dies of thirst.Cockroaches can eat anything, including other cockroaches. They play an important role in the decomposition of forest litter and excreta. But because they breed rapidly, soil things, and are potential disease carriers, cockroaches are the most misunderstood creatures in the insect kingdom.So even as they continue to be targeted by shoes, brooms or vaccum cleaners, chances are that they will, finally, outlast humans.

It will be 24 kilometres long.The scientists at the centre say the road will be stronger than normal roads. They can talk with such confidence because they have tried it out earlier. And, the road they made was indeed stronger. It did not develop holes after the monsoons got over.Most of the roads in the country need repairs after the rains. They actually look like they have broken bones after the beating they receive at the hands of the monsoons.NIRJAFT made a road in a village called Guptipara, which is about 100 kilometres from Calcutta. When they were making the road, they used a thin layer of jute between the gravel, or small stones used in making roads, and the soil. This ensured that the rainwater, which collected by the roadside, was drained much faster than usual. As a result, the road lasted much longer.The scientists say the thin layer of jute also helps keep the gravel in place. This was reported in the The Times of India recently.The report mentioned a scientist as saying that by using jute, a road’s life can be increased by three to four years.The research centre is planning to make wide rolls of jute, which will be used to make these roads.

The soft sand that we sink into on the beach is actually rock? Sand is what a rock becomes after years of being worn down by rivers. Years of sea waves crashing against huge rocks and cliffs makes rocks break into small particles. And ultimately, they end up as sand. The colours of sands — yellow, red, grey, black — depend on the kind of rock it comes from. Sometimes desert sand is carried by winds across great distances, to seasides, increasing the amount of sand in the sea.Cracked lava rocks from Mauna Loa volcano, one of five volcanoes that form the Island of Hawaii. It is the largest active volcano on Earth.The earth has more than 600 active volcanoes. Many of them are to be found on what is called the ‘Ring of Fire’ on land and under water around the Pacific Ocean. The largest active volcano on the Earth today is the Mauna Loa, which is about 4168 metres (13,677 feet) high. It is on the Hawaiian islands. One volcanic explosion in Mauna Loa lasted for more than a year. Among the other volcanic areas in the world are Indonesia and Iceland. While the former has more than 600 of them, the latter boasts of having about 200 volcanoes. Many people have died due to volcanic eruptions. It is believed that the ancient city of Pompeii was destroyed completely because of a volcanic eruption. If volcanoes are so destructive, why do people live near them, one might ask. That’s because the ash that covers the land after a volcanic explosion makes the land very fertile. So people are prepared to take the risk.Earthquakes, too, can happen on land or under the seas. Most of the earthquakes also occur in the area known as the “ring of fire” that encircles the Pacific Ocean. Turkey, which had a terrible earthquake last year, falls in this earthquake prone area. A large part of the Himalayan region, too, falls in the earthquake zone. Two major earthquakes in the 1990s prove this fact. However, it is not as if we get to know about all earthquakes. Many vibrations of the Earth’s crust are so tiny that they escape our notice. We only get to know about the large earthquakes. It is said that almost a million earthquakes occur in one year. Of these, a large earthquake occurs every two weeks under the sea.One-tenth of the Earth’s surface is always under the cover of ice. And almost 90 per cent of that ice is to be found in the continent of Antarctica. The remaining 10 per cent is found on the mountains in the form of glaciers. Imagine, the ice sheet that covers Antarctica is almost one-and-a-half times the size of America. And the only creatures that live on Antarctica all year round, are insects.Antarctica, too, has one active volcano. It is called Mt.

The female barks like a dog, and the male makes a deep roaring noise which can be heard several miles away! They have a special organ – a bony box in their throat which makes sounds that boom like a drum. Howler monkeys live high in the trees, and often march along the branches in long lines.The Uakari (pronounced wackari) is perhaps the strangest looking monkey. It is bald headed with a bright red face! It loves the sun, so it lives in the treetops where it can get lots of sunlight. (And if a Uakari is kept indoors away from the sun, its bright red face goes pale pink!)The Colobus monkey is a very picky eater – it eats only leaves. But since leaves by themselves are not very good food, the monkeys have to eat a huge amount of leaves to get enough nutrition. And because of this, Colobus monkeys have large stomachs!The Langur is also called a Leaf monkey.Since the leaves provide enough water, some Langurs can go for months without drinking!

But if the thought of a holiday in space is mind-boggling, the cost of that thought is even more so – almost $200 million for an out-of-the-world experience! Realising the need to make space travel as normal as buses or trains, an American company called the X Prize Foundation is trying to cut down the cost of space travel.If the company succeeds, one lucky human could be heading for a space vacation at the cost of a bus ticket! The foundation is organising a lottery for a seat on the rocket that will zoom up in space. There’s a slight catch, though. The rocket is yet to be designed.Since its inception in 1996, the X Prize Foundation has attracted several sponsors. It is now offering $10 million (about Rs 40 crore) for the best rocket design. Seventeen international teams, including a few amateurs, are competing to build the safest and most affordable passenger rocket.Space Tourism: Ready for a Skyrocketing HolidayThe Foundation’s officials say that for a craft to be eligible for the prize, it must fly twice within a 14-day period with three passengers on board. It must fly 100 km high into space. While none of the contestants are ready with their designs, a few are confident of creating the ideal spacecraft by the year 2002. The X Prize Foundation was founded in 1996, by a group of American businesspeople intent on creating low-cost space travel vehicles.The X Prize is formulated in the style of early aviation prizes. In the 1900s, hundreds of aviation prizes inspired different aircraft designs. The prizes also motivated pilots to set records which were hitherto thought of as impossible. Charles Lindbergh, was one such contestant, who became the first person to fly nonstop across the Atlantic alone.

After Chimpu had played with his friends for over an hour, he came back sweating and tired, to sit beside his grandfather at the park bench. There he found his grandfather throwing peanuts, brought from home, to the scampering squirrels at his feet.In fact, bushy-tailed squirrels are a common sight in the city’s parks and gardens. This frisky little rodent is constantly scampering around, and it is indeed rare to come across one perfectly still.It has long been observed that tree squirrels often stash away nuts in holes of trees where they stay. This is done by squirrels and most animals as a stand-by measure during the cold winter months when food becomes scarce.Some tree squirrels, on the other hand, bury their nuts in the ground. More often than not, the squirrels hide it in so many holes that they forget where they have buried them! Some of these hidden-and-forgotten nuts, uneaten seeds and other squirrel delicacies, germinate and grow into new plants.The grey squirrel, for instance, tends to bury acorns about 100 ft away from the tree that produced it. Sometimes their sensitive noses help them retrieve their cache, while at other times the forgotten seed germinates.Red squirrel with nutA survey carried out by Canadian scientists shows that the red squirrels of North America and Canada start hoarding nuts for their young even before they’re born. Apparently these rodents are just as foresighted as human parents!The female red squirrel stashes away nuts for herself and creates an additional food cache, nearly four months before her offspring is born. This is so similar to humans saving up for their future child. And when the baby squirrel is all set to leave the nest, the mother squirrel gives her young, her extra storage of nuts.What is particularly exciting is the fact that this is perhaps the first time scientists have proved that animals show concern for their young – before they are born. The research team insists that the young squirrels (that receive the nuts from their mother) are more likely to survive in the long run, as they do not have to immediately forage for food and expose themselves to predators.Did you know that squirrels are found in all parts of the world except Australia and the deserts of Africa? The common striped squirrel, that we often see, belongs to a group of rodents that includes the ground squirrels, flying squirrels and chipmunks. Squirrels come in all shapes and range in size from about five inches for the pygmy squirrels of Africa, to the 36-inch long giant squirrels of Asia.Squirrels are chiefly of two types – tree-dwelling and ground-dwelling. There is yet another subspecies known as flying squirrels.Tree squirrels spend most of their time in trees and descend to the ground in search of food. They are active during the day sleeping at night in the trees, snuggled up in leafy nests. Ground squirrels usually dig their own burrows, while others prefer settling down in a hole in the ground or in an opening between rocks.Contrary to their popular name, flying squirrels, like other ‘flying’ reptiles (snakes, geckos, lizards) cannot fly. They merely glide from higher to lower tree branches by means of a blanket-like membrane of furry skin stretched between the front and hind legs. This membrane is called the ‘patagium’ (pronounced pa-tha-ghee-yum) and acts like a parachute helping the animal to engage in controlled gliding.Although the distance of most glides is no more than a few feet, the giant flying squirrel of Asia has been known to glide more than 1,300 feet!","keyword":"[\"squirrel\", \"grandfather\", \"tree\", \"rodent\", \"bury\", \"glide\"]","ALS":"35.36842105263158"},{"english_id":"612","id":"613","level":"4","topic":"2","title":"Storm Petrel: A Bird that Walks on Water","article":"You must have heard of St. Peter, the saint, who is said to have walked on water.

So, it is forced to remain in the air day and night, till the storm subsides!The petrel has webbed feet, which help aid its “walking” action. In fact, the petrel is the smallest of all web-footed birds. It is about the size of a swallow.The petrel lives in oceans and comes on to the land only during the breeding season. There are about 80 kinds of petrels.The petrel that appears off the eastern and southern coasts of the United States during the summer is called the Wilson’s petrel. It is sooty black in colour and has a white patch on its rump. It is about 18 cm long and has a short bill and long stilt-like legs. It greets the people with a friendly chatter, but it is not a song bird.Another stormy petrel that is commonly seen in the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea in the northern hemisphere is called the Leach’s petrel.

A fierce battle was fought as the prehistoric tribesmen armed with spears and stone catapults attacked the Mammoth.The Mammoth, almost twice the size of a modern African Elephant, charged and stomped. And as a spear pierced its heart, it gave one last heart wrenching cry and fell to the ground with a loud thud, a sound that reverberated through the mountains.As the cries of the Mammoth died out, a thunder followed. The snow-covered mountain slopes gave away in a giant avalanche. The avalanche covered the body of the dying Mammoth and it froze. The body remained in a frozen state for many many years, till it was discovered by another group of humans 20,000 years later.Artistic recreation of baby & mother Wooly MammothThis time it was not a hunting tribe, but a group of paleontologists, armed with pick axes and powerful scientific instruments.Paleontologists are scientists who dig into the earth in search of remnants or impressions of pre-historic life. This would help them learn more about the history of life on earth.Fossils: Tell tale stories of life and deathThe skull of a Mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) at a dig site in South Dakota, United States.These remnants are called fossils. Fossils are generally formed when an animal dies and gets buried in some material that prevents weathering and decay.But, not all fossils have their entire body intact like the Mammoth. Sometimes, the body of the animal decays and the bones are left behind. Or, in some other conditions, the bones and flesh disappear, but an impression of the body structure is left behind.These bones and impressions help paleontologists to put together pieces of the organism and how its life must have been. The dinosaur was discovered in a similar way – after scientists found dinosaur bones.A window into the pastSome of the fossils that have been discovered are millions of years old – some of them belong to the time when life began on earth, 450 million years ago.In the Grand Canyon, in Colorado, US, the walls show separate layers of soil, each belonging to a different era. Each layer has fossils of different organisms that reveal how each age differed from the other in plant and animal life.The fossils, thus help scientists to put together the events that occurred in the history of earth and the impacts it had on animal and plant life.","keyword":"[\"mammoth\", \"fossil\", \"impression\", \"tribesman\", \"remnant\", \"spear\"]","ALS":"37.333333333333336"},{"english_id":"616","id":"617","level":"4","topic":"3","title":"The Colours of Light","article":"A beam of light seems to have no colour. Actually, it is made up of coloured rays. Usually, these coloured rays combine to form the white light. But it is possible to see the different colours at certain times. For instance, when it rains and the sun’s rays pass through raindrops. Since the raindrop has many sides or surfaces, the rays split up into a fanshape of different colours. And we see the rainbow. Violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.Light moves through space as waves. These waves have a frequency and a wavelength. The number of ups (crest) and downs (trough) a wave touches in one second is called the frequency. The distance between one crest and another or one trough and another is called its wavelength.The coloured light rays have different wavelengths, which form an array, called the light spectrum. Violet and red form the two extremes of the spectrum. Any light, whose wavelength is shorter than violet or longer than that of red cannot be seen by us.There are two more reasons why see a particular colour and not another. It depends on the material the light falls on. Another reason is how the eye sees the colour.So a ripe tomato is bright red because its skin reflects the red light in sunlight, and absorbs all other colours. By itself, the tomato is not red.In the same way, some objects appear to change colour if they are tilted towards or away from the light. And if the light source is changed, an object’s colour may alter. The changing colours of the sea provide the best example.When light strikes water, most of it is reflected. Some of it goes under the surface. The sea gets its colour when light is scattered from beneath the surface.Also, different wavelengths of light penetrate to different depths.Thus, if the water is clear, the red and yellow wavelengths of light are absorbed, leaving only blue-green light to be scattered back. That is why clear seas appear bluer.The dark blue of the Mediterranean Sea comes from the sky and its reflection in the water. On cloudy days the same sea could appear to be grey.Also cells that are sensitive to light are distributed differently in the retina of the eye in different people. That is why people often fight about the colour of the sea or flower or car that they are seeing. They should just make “light” of their differences.","keyword":"[\"colour\", \"wavelength\", \"violet\", \"trough\", \"crest\", \"spectrum\"]","ALS":"19.333333333333332"},{"english_id":"617","id":"618","level":"4","topic":"6","title":"The Cool Firefly","article":"Firefly is just a name.

And the purpose behind it is to attract beetles for mating. But one firefly’s signal is different from another’s, depending on its sex and the type of family it belongs to. If a firefly sends a signal at a fixed interval but gets a response either too soon or too late, it will ignore the signal. It is like a perfect dance sequence. If you are faster or slower than your partner, the dance fails.Closeup of a fireflyFireflies come from two families of beetles.

And, like these animals, you would make a hole in the ground and wait till the sun goes down.The Cool and Cunning LarkBut, birds do not have the ability to dig burrows. They have to think of other means to escape the sun, by thinking smartly. The desert lark, found in the Arabian desert, is one such creature. Borrow or steal another animal’s burrow is its philosophy. It spends its days in burrows made by the Egyptian spiny-tailed lizard.Often, the original owner of the house, the lizard, also is found in the burrow. But since the lizard is a vegetarian and quite happy to have company, the bird is safe. The Economist magazine has reported these fascinating facts discovered by two scientists in the desert near Taif, Saudi Arabia. The scientists have found that there are as many as 30 burrows in every square kilometre of desert land. And that probably saves the lark’s life.Out in the sun, the hoopoe lark’s body rapidly loses water — almost 10 per cent of its body weight in one hour in direct sunlight. Even in the shade, it loses about 1.4 grams of water an hour. It saves itself by lying flat on the ground.But the lark is not a bird that believes in sharing and caring, as the scientists found out. They took out a lark from one burrow and placed it in another which was already occupied by another bird. That one was not willing to share its space with the outsider and fought with it. Which is rather strange, for the lizard burrow has enough space for many of them. It is almost three to four metres long.

The climate is such that it is good for life forms of all kinds — from trees to animals, birds and insects.These forests are called tropical rainforests. Most of them are located near the equator, in Asia, Africa and South America. The rainforests of the Amazon basin in South America is one of the lushest rainforests in the world. You will find more varieties of trees or animal life here than anywhere else in the world.The rains are frequent and heavy — as much as 100 inches at one time. Thunderstorms occur every three or four days. Because of abundant rain, the trees grow to a height of almost 40 metres. There are trees at lower heights as well. The shade from all these trees almost blocks out the sunlight. Which is why you will never find smaller plants or shrubs in a rainforest. Smaller plants can be seen only where there are open spaces or clearings in the forest.The rainforests of the Amazon basin in South America is one of the lushest rainforest in the world.What you can see in abundance in these rainforests are animals, birds and insects of many kinds — and they all have special characteristics.

Leopards, snakes, crocodiles, anteaters, big lizards are some of the animals found in tropical rainforests.There are also the army ants that gobble up anything that stands on their way! Mosquitoes, sweat bees and even the common housefly have had their homes in these forests for long.The tropical rainforests are called the green lungs of the planet, and with good reason. They absorb carbon dioxide from around them to process their food and release oxygen into the air. That oxygen gives us life. They also contain the maximum number of trees with medicinal value.But now human beings are out to harm the rainforests.

A patent is an official document which recognises that a person or company has indeed created or invented a new product. Thus the person or company has the sole right to make and sell that product.It was very strange. An American company was trying to make sure that the “free tree” became its slave. The company filed an application for a patent on the neem fungicide at the European Patent Office at Munich in Germany.It took some time for the government of India to get into action. And then, scientists started collecting proof of the fact that Indians have used neem seeds as a fungicide for thousands of years. And this knowledge has been available for anyone and everyone.The case took a long time. The good news came last week and the newspapers wrote about it on their front pages. The European Patent Office had rejected the claim of the American company that it had created a new fungicide from new seeds.The four-member panel of judges also had a name for the action of the US company. They called it bio-piracy. What it meant was that the company had tried to steal people’s knowledge of plants for its own profit by pretending that it was the company’s own creation.In the countries of Asia and Africa, people still have a very valuable collection of knowledge about trees and plants and their medicinal qualities.

They speak when they are angry, and they speak when they see a thing of beauty. They try to speak even when they have toothaches, and often they speak even when they have nothing to say. Well, songbirds are quite the same.They sing to tell their winged neighbours and strangers that the branch on which they are sitting, or the shrub that grows next to the school, is THEIR home. Or they may sing to warn other birds that an enemy is near. During the mating season, male birds sing with great feeling because they want to attract female birds. All in all, the songs range from simple to a more complex range of sounds.The sparrow, the parrot, the thrush, the koel and even the crows, are songbirds. Nearly half the bird population in the world consists of songbirds. There are about 4,000 species of songbirds which are grouped under various families, ranging between 35 to 55. They are called passerine birds; in other words, perching birds. Many of these songbirds are birds that are kept in cages as you may have seen. Songbirds get their ability to sing because of a highly developed and powerful vocal organ, which is called the syrinx or the song box.Some of these birds can be very human. For example, some whistler birds cannot stand any hint of a challenge. Earlier, they would try to drown the sound of thunder with their shouts. These days they try to compete with the high-noise, high-flying aircraft.Ornithologists say they seem to practice their songs in some kind of schools with elders guiding them along.From the way they sing we might be tempted to think that these songbirds are bright and beautiful. But, no, these birds are often small, dull-coloured creatures. And they lead solitary lives on forest floors or open grassland. Looking at the dull appearance of the songbird, it is difficult to imagine that it could even sing!In fact, male birds with beautifully coloured feathers do not sing; their bright plumage is enough to attract the opposite, or to give a clear signal to other birds about its claim to home and territory. Similarly, there is a reason for the dull appearance of songbirds. It helps hide them from their enemies.The birdsongs are not always pleasing too. In fact, sometimes they are downright irritating. An American who studied the red-eyed vireo or preacher bird discovered that it made the same sound 22,197 times in a single day! As the well known Indian ornithologist Dr. Salim Ali has remarked, hearing the melodious sound of the koel can also prove hard on the ears!Usually it is the male who sings, but sometimes the female joins if only to strengthen the bond with her mate.

They tried to conceal the inclination by using longer pieces of stone on the sinking south side and shorter ones on the north. Five more floors were added, but that only added to the weight pushing down on the soil by several thousand tons and the building sank deeper into the soft ground.The restoration projectEngineers estimate that the tower has been shifting about one-twentieth of an inch every year. And, over time, the 180 feet tall tower (when measured from the top) has shifted more than 13 feet from the vertical. In the past, many attempts have been made to bring the tower to an upright position with unsuccessful results.The current restoration project, which started about 11 years ago, involved correcting the tilt by removing soil from under the tower’s northern side (i.e. the higher side).This exercise has reduced the slant by 16 inches and while the figure may seem minuscule, engineers are now satisfied that the building is safe. However, they point out that all their work may come to naught if there is an earthquake or a particularly vicious storm.","keyword":"[\"tower\", \"lean\", \"inclination\", \"restoration\", \"tilt\", \"pisa\"]","ALS":"35.666666666666664"},{"english_id":"648","id":"649","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"Tree Rings tell many Tales","article":"Examining ancient trees helps scientists get an amazing picture of Earth’s life, for trees are a record of their life time. By looking closely at the rings of a tree, scientists can not only tell how old it is; they can also tell you that in one summer in 1453 and again in 1601, there were freak cold spells.Tree rings, when radiocarbon-dated give a glimpse of certain aspects of prehistoric times. But what is radiocarbon dating?Scientists can use ‘dendrochronology’ or the study of tree time, to learn about past climates by studying the patterns of very old trees.Radiocarbon dating involves measuring the amount of carbon-14 that remains in a fossil. Carbon-14 is a naturally-occurring material found in the atmosphere. As plants and animals use the air, their tissues absorb some of the carbon-14.After they die, they no longer absorb the carbon-14 and their tissues start to decay. So, measuring the amount of carbon-14 in the fossil tells us about its age.Perhaps thousands of years from now, scientists will be able to carry out similar investigations on trees planted today and get some information on the state of pollution. They might claim with reasonable authority, that the amounts of lead in the air decreased as oil became a less common fuel.Right now, the oldest living tree in the world grows on the White mountains in California. About 4,600 years old, it is nicknamed ‘Methuselah’, after the ancestor of Noah who is said to have lived for 969 years. The age of the tree has been estimated by counting the number of its growth rings.Every growth season, a tree adds a new layer of wood to its trunk. Each ring has two parts – a wide, light part and a narrow, dark part. Tree rings provide clues about the climate, and evidence of disturbance around the tree such as fires and floods.The shape and width of the annual rings can differ from year to year due to varying growth conditions. In general, wide rings indicate good conditions for growth (plenty of nutrients, water and sunshine).Narrow rings often indicate less favourable conditions (drought, cold, insect damage, disease, competition and lack of nutrients). If a disturbance occurs after the growth season, it produces a narrow or misshapen ring the following year.Scientists can use ‘dendrochronology’ or the study of tree time, to learn about past climates by studying the patterns of very old trees. To look at a tree’s growth rings without harming the tree, scientists use a technique called coring.By drilling into the centre of the trunk with a hollow instrument, called an increment borer, they can remove a long, narrow cylinder of wood called a core sample. The growth rings appear as lines on the core sample.These interesting facts come from the ‘Woodpecker volume 2000’, an annual compilation on the state of the planet, published by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehradun, in north India.","keyword":"[\"tree\", \"growth\", \"narrow\", \"dendrochronology\", \"climate\", \"disturbance\"]","ALS":"36.93333333333333"},{"english_id":"650","id":"651","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"Watery Facts","article":"The Pacific Ocean is three times bigger than Asia, the biggest continent on Earth.

To many people, there’s only one kind of shark: the man-eating white shark of the movie Jaws. They think sharks are ruthless predators that attack anything they come across.Sharks are sometimes thought of as primitive creatures as they have been in existence for million of years. In fact, sharks are very intelligent. They have a fantastic sense of smell and hearing as well as good vision in low light conditions.Their sense of smell is so acute that they can detect a drop of blood dissolved in over one million gallons of water! And they can hear can detect a struggling fish over two kilometres away.Sharks do not have external ears. They detect sound with the help of their lateral line system which consists of hundreds of pores along the side of the shark’s body. These pores are highly sensitive to wave movements, pressure changes and vibrations in the water.There are approximately 350 species of sharks. All sharks are boneless fishes and their skeleton is made of cartilage or elastic tissue. Sharkskin has the same feel as sandpaper and can easily peel human skin off if rubbed against.Sharks have rows of triangular razor-sharp teeth that get renewed throughout their lives. As one tooth breaks off or wears out, another one rotates forward from the inside of the jaw to replace it.Predatory carnivores, sharks are rarely man-eaters. Except under unusual circumstances, sharks do not attack people. Most shark attacks are caused by humans getting too close to sharks, or if the shark is provoked and feels threatened.Only four species are considered dangerous: the great white, tiger shark, bull shark and the oceanic white-tip shark.Tiger Shark: Sometimes called ‘the garbage can of the sea’ because it is known to swallow almost anything that it encounters, including inedible manmade objectsThey come in all shapes and sizes. While the great white may reach 21 feet in length and weigh over 2,500 pounds, the largest, of course, is the whale shark at 60 feet. The smallest is the spined pygmy at 10 inches. Almost all the species have asymmetrical tails – the upper part is larger than the lower half.Whale Shark: The whale shark is found in tropical and warm oceans and lives in the open sea, with a lifespan of about 70 years.Some sharks lay egg-filled cases, while others give birth to live young ones. The gestation period varies with the species ranging from nine months to 20 months. Again, depending on the species, a female shark can produce two to 135 young at a single time.Sharks are the most misunderstood creatures in the world. They have an extremely useful role to play undersea. High up in the food chain, they help maintain the balance of the ecosystem by keeping it going.Unfortunately, sharks are commercially hunted. They are hunted for their oily livers, skin, teeth, flesh, or just killed because they are thought dangerous. This has not only endangered its life but has put the ocean food chain at risk.It is especially important for us humans to understand the nature of the problem. As social beings, we rule the planet and use its land, water and air resources pretty much as we please, with no thought for tomorrow.Hammerhead Shark: So named for the unusual structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into aBut, as biological beings, we are not the most important link in the food chain. We are a part of the huge food chain consisting of millions of creatures, ranging from the unseen microscopic ones to the big beasts.And any decision that we may take as the rulers of the planet may ultimately, boomerang on us.If the shark could speak, that is the message it would perhaps give us.","keyword":"[\"shark\", \"chain\", \"detect\", \"specie\", \"pore\", \"creature\"]","ALS":"29"},{"english_id":"654","id":"655","level":"4","topic":"1","title":"What Kind of Horses did Knights Ride?","article":"In 1066 AD the Normans (people who came from Normandy in Europe) conquered England and introduced feudalism in England. Feudalism was a system of contract where society was divided into four classes: royalty, barons (noblemen) and bishops, knights (a title or a rank) and lastly peasants. Merchants and artisans were placed just above the peasants.From 1066 to about the 14th century, feudalism developed across Europe. There were no professional armies at that time like we have today. Every man who was called upon was expected to follow his king in battle. The king granted land to these knights. A knighthood was obtained either by birth into a noble family or through bravery in battle.Armored rider with lance on horseThe king gave these knights the right to fight on horseback. The knights were thus loyal to both the king and the noblemen.These knights of Europe displayed exceptional fighting skill with lance, sword or battle-axe and wore heavy armour to protect them. The armour also protected them from stones thrown by large catapults and arrows.The knight was an important fighter and had to know two basic skills: how to fight and how to ride a horse. A knights’ armour consisted of heavy steel plates to cover his body, a heavy helmet and a shirt of mail (finely intertwined metal rings set very close to each other). The knight also wore gloves, leggings and shoes of mail or metal.All this heavy weight could only be carried on a horse as the armour was too cumbersome for the knight to walk with. He actually needed another person called a squire (young men training to be a knight) and a page (a male servant) to guide him around as the helmet didn’t permit the knight to see very well.The horses that the knights used were very large and heavy, similar to draught horses of today, but highly trained and far from clumsy. These battle horses, wore a suit of armour too!A knight from his higher position on the horse, had an advantage over the foot soldier. So each knight, if he could afford it, kept several horses. He used a different horse for different occasions.During a jousting tournament (where knights displayed their skill in combat by fighting each other) the knight rode a horse called a charger that was heavy and strong. In hand-to-hand combat he used a lighter horse called a courser.When the knight was not fighting he used a horse called a palfrey, as did his lady and the squire.The knights trained their horses to do many things. Each manoeuvre the horse did was called by a different name. For instance, the knight could cause his horse to sink on its hind legs – a position called a levade – and remain immobile while he used a sword.From this position, the horse could rise and hop forward a step or two, a position called a courbette (from the French word meaning crow). It was also trained to stand on its hind legs and kick the enemy with its fore legs and this was called capriole.It was a miracle, how the knight maintained his seating through all this, while his steel armour encumbered him. The saddle was so built with high front and back seating that the knight could only fall sideways.However, if the knight did fall down, he could never get up and back on his horse without the help of another person!To identify themselves to their friends and enemy, the knights and his horses displayed a coat of arms (family badge) either on the shield, which the knight carried to ward off blows, or on the horse’s tunic.With the invention of gunpowder, the armour and knights disappeared to be replaced by light cavalry where soldiers carried muskets and pistols.","keyword":"[\"knight\", \"horse\", \"armour\", \"feudalism\", \"heavy\", \"ride\"]","ALS":"35"},{"english_id":"655","id":"656","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"What Makes the Egg Shell so Strong?","article":"Have you ever wondered why hens don’t break their eggs when they sit on them? The secret lies in the shape of the egg. An egg is a great example of nature’s excellent skills in packing. If you squeeze the ends of an egg between the palms of your hands, it won’t break. However, if you squeeze it in the middle, it pops and creates a terrible mess.If you have seen the way eggs are sold in the market, you would have noticed that they are kept with their ends pointing up and are never left lying horizontally. Hens, too, incubate their eggs the same way, with the narrower end pointing upwards.What Makes the Egg Shell so Strong?For distorting or crushing an object, its shape is as important as the material it is made of. Although an eggshell is really fragile, its queer dome-shaped end makes it a ‘tough nut to crack’.The architectural connectionIf you have seen the Taj Mahal or any mosque, you would have noticed that the roof is a huge dome. In earlier architectural forms, buildings had huge horizontal roofs which had to be supported by a large number of pillars.The dome is, however, a curved structure – it has no angles and no corners – and it can enclose an enormous amount of space without the help of a single column.What the dome essentially does is that it distributes the weight and the pressure applied on the top evenly to the entire structure. In fact, in architecture, the dome is one of the strongest designs for it supports the weight of the roof evenly so that no single point on the dome supports the whole load and gives way under stress.Similarly, the dome shape of each end of the egg distributes all the weight evenly and minimises stress and strain.A simple experimentYou can actually test this with a simple experiment. Take two eggs and poke a tiny hole at the narrow end of each egg and pour out the contents. Then stick a thick tape around the middle of each egg and carefully cut through the tape with a small pair of sharp scissors. The tape will prevent the eggs from cracking and you will get four half eggshells of equal sizes with level bottoms.Place the four eggshells (cut side down) on a flat surface in a rectangular shape in such a way that the rectangle is slightly smaller than your books. Then lay a book on the eggshells. Then another. Do the shells crack?While adding the books, do make sure the eggshells do not move. If they get pushed around, they will crack. Continue till the egg shells crack. If you weigh the books you had placed on the shells to see how much weight the eggs could take, it will be much more than the average weight of a hen.","keyword":"[\"dome\", \"eggshell\", \"crack\", \"shell\", \"weight\", \"roof\"]","ALS":"29.333333333333332"},{"english_id":"657","id":"658","level":"4","topic":"17","title":"What are Canal Locks?","article":"In some rivers or canals the water is not too deep for large ocean-going ships. In such places large watertight compartments are built that help ships and boats go up or down different levels on rivers or canals. These are called canal locks.In certain areas, man-made canals are constructed to connect two water bodies. These canals are built to help cut down the distance a large ship would otherwise have to take to reach its destination. The canals are therefore constructed at a higher level, like the Panama Canal to prevent land on either side from getting flooded.The canal is divided into various levels according to its depth. The compartment or lock in which the ship enters is very large and rectangular with gates on each end. A ship that needs to go to a higher level enters the bottom or downstream gate. The gates are then closed.Once the ship enters the lock, water is pumped in by means of sluices (holes) in the gates. The water level in the compartment is then raised to that of the higher level and the upstream gate is opened for the ship to get out to the next level.At each level, water is pumped in or emptied to raise the ship to the next level. Currently, some large canals use pipes running the length of the level to give an equal discharge and to fill up the lock faster.Earlier these locks used to be manually operated but of late hydraulic power is used to operate these locks.The canal locks or watertight chambers vary in length from the smallest at 120 ft to the largest at 1,200 ft. They used to be made of timber or stone earlier but are gradually being replaced by concrete and steel.Among the well-known canals are the 40-mile long Panama Canal and the Suez Canal. The Panama Canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and separates North and South America. The Suez Canal in Egypt connects the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.","keyword":"[\"canal\", \"lock\", \"ship\", \"level\", \"gate\", \"compartment\"]","ALS":"27.23076923076923"},{"english_id":"661","id":"662","level":"4","topic":"17","title":"What are Q-Tips?","article":"Everbody has used this product at some time or other in some form or other. Sometimes it is used to clean the wax from your ears, and sometimes to clean dust from delicate instruments. Many kick themselves for not patenting it when they knew about it.So what are Q-Tips? It is such a simple silly thingummy – a piece of thick plastic or cardboard with cotton wrapped at each end! Q-Tips are today, a registered trademark of Chesebrough-Ponds, Inc, USA. However, it was invented in 1920 by a Polish-born American, Leo Gerstenzang.Legend has it that Leo saw his wife using cotton wrapped around a toothpick to clean their baby’s ears like a swab. Leo was amazed and angry at his wife for he felt that a small error on her part could pierce the baby’s ear or worse, make the child deaf!Leo then decided to make a ready-made cotton swab, instead of a makeshift one like a toothpick that could be used to perform the same task without any fear or injury or risk.Though it was a simple concept, it took him several years to work the irregularities out. Since safety was his first concern, he had to discount wood splints. It stood the risk of splintering and breaking, or poking.Next Gerstenzang had a problem with the cotton swab. He wanted cotton on either end of the cotton “ball”. He also needed to get an equal amount on both ends of the swab and to design a way to keep it from falling off or little bits of fluff sticking in the ear.He worked on his concept for many years. At this point, he named his company the Leo Gerstenzang Infant Novelty Company to market his new creation.Now he had to think of what to name his product. He came up with various ideas and names. At last he chose the name Baby Gays.However, he found that Baby Gays was not a marketable name and in 1926, he changed the name to Q-Tips Baby Gays.But what did the Q in Q-Tips stand for? Q stood for “Quality”. Later, the word Baby Gays part was dropped altogether and thus Q-Tips was born.Q-Tips is today made from thick cardboard with two small cotton swabs at the end.

Truffles? Hey, its no trifling matter – there are organisations in France and Italy which let you take part in truffle hunts!Truffles are a rare and delicate type of edible mushrooms that look like little potato nuggets. They grow in open woodlands in regions with a warm and moderate climate, on soil rich in calcium or limestone.Truffles are found under the ground at a depth of up to 30 cm under roots of elm or oak trees. These mushrooms are a food delicacy known for their rich taste. Some people describe it as musky and fiery, while others compare it to a blend of garlic and pungent cheese.They are very expensive and in great demand.There are at least 32 kinds of truffles and are classified under the group Ascomycetes. Some truffles are the size of a pea while others are as big as an orange. Both Provence in southern France and Italy boast of the best truffle but according to experts, the very best come from the Perigord region in France.Truffles need a certain amount of rain and extensive exposure to the sun. They need to be cushioned in loose soil where they can feed off the roots of elm or oak trees with enough space in which to grow.It is difficult to locate them just by looking for them. Sometimes they occur near the surface of the earth but they crack as they reach full size. Even then only experienced gatherers can easily detect them. Truffle colonies also attract small yellow flies that can be seen hovering over them in the morning and evening.Although truffles are in great demand as a food item, it is difficult to cultivate truffles as a business. The ground is first dug over and oak acorns or elm seedlings planted. Soil from truffle areas is then spread about. It then takes fives years or so for truffles to appear. But it is profitable only after 8 or 10 years have passed. The yield is at its maximum from 15 to 25 years after initial planting.The truffle smell attracts small rodents to eat them and help spread the spores – a mushroom’s version of seeds – around the forest.This smell from the truffles is very appealing to female pigs or sows as it is similar to that emitted by a male pig. So truffle hunters often train sows to hunt for truffles. But once a sow turns up a truffle, it can be quite a struggle to persuade her to give up the find. To avoid the fight, some truffle hunters prefer trained dogs like poodles.Many ‘trufficulteurs’ as truffle hunters are called, have rights to several hectares of truffle territory spread out over the region. So for six months of the year the hunters and their dogs or pigs sniff, hike and dig their way to a nice profit.In case you join a truffle hunt and your shoes emit a smell, watch out for pigs. You will find it difficult to give up without a grunt!","keyword":"[\"truffle\", \"hunter\", \"mushroom\", \"italy\", \"france\", \"root\"]","ALS":"26.136363636363637"},{"english_id":"663","id":"664","level":"4","topic":"7","title":"What are Volcanic Tubeworms?","article":"In order to raise chicks the farmer keeps the eggs warm and is careful not to crush them. But when scientists in the University of Southern California rear tubeworms, they keep the immature worms very cold and under high pressure.You would think the scientists are being cruel by subjecting these little worms to such extreme conditions. They are not.The worms can thrive only under these circumstances, because they live in the deep sea where it is very cold. They thrive on the sulphurous vents of volcanoes at a depth of 8,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean.Tube wormThe tubeworms, which resemble giant, spindly stalks of bamboo, live in clusters of millions, covering huge areas on the ocean floor. They have a thin, flexible, tube on their bodies made from secretions of a hard, mineral substance or from sand granules that provides them protection and support.The giant tubewormThey grow to enormous lengths; some have even been known to grow up to 10 feet in length. They have no eyes, mouths or intestines and are sustained by a scientific process known as chemosynthesis.They do not have food as we know it. They can just make do with some chemicals seeping out of volcanic vents on the sea floor. This process of using chemicals for their body’s needs is called chemosynthesis. But, not all tubeworms show such behaviour. Some kinds gather small bits of food from the water with their tentacles.The University of Southern California research team, headed by Professor Donal Manahan, is working towards finding out more about chemosynthesis, which is similar to photosynthesis. Instead of creating energy by absorbing sunlight, the worms absorb sulphur and other volcanic gases for their needs.The research team also wants to find out how giant tubeworms manage to colonise volcanic vents.A long lifeBelieve it or not, tubeworms are one of the longest living creatures in the world. Giant tubeworms living 1,700 feet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico have been around for more than 250 years. Although some species of turtles live even longer, these worms are the longest living invertebrates.Invertebrates are creatures who do not have a spinal cord. Of the thousands of animal species, which exist today, more than 95 per cent are invertebrates, ranging from corals and jellyfish to insects.How old are you, tubeworm?Finding out the age of a giant sea worm is not as easy as counting the rings of a tree. To determine the worms’ age, scientists travelled to the bottom of the sea in a submarine and used robotic arms to stain the tips of some tubes blue.Three months later, they returned and measured how much each worm had grown above the stain. They repeated this process every few months for four years. Once they had these measurements, they were able to calculate how long it would have taken for the worms to grow to their present lengths.","keyword":"[\"tubeworms\", \"worm\", \"volcanic\", \"giant\", \"chemosynthesis\", \"stain\"]","ALS":"30.941176470588236"},{"english_id":"667","id":"668","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"What is Artificial Intelligence?","article":"If you touch a hot metal object, you will yank your hand away immediately. When this happens to you the first time, the sequence of events and the result (the burning of your hand) gets stored in your brain. This is what we call an experience.When you see a hot metal object next time, you will not touch it. You will use the knowledge of your previous experience and decide to not repeat it again.This process of learning, comparing a previous experience, making a decision and acting upon it is the key to human intelligence. We can make more and more complicated decisions by learning from our past experiences.What is Artificial Intelligence?Ever since machines were invented, scientists have dreamt of making them learn and perform intelligent tasks – like humans.Artificial intelligence is a branch of science which is into making machines think like humans. These machines, or computers, can store large amounts of information and process them accurately and at an amazing speed. What they lack is an ability to learn and make ‘intelligent decisions’.What do we need to make an intelligent machine? A memory or a space where experiences or information can be stored, a method of applying these experiences to new ones, comparing experiences to come to logical conclusions, like holding the hot object with a glove on. That would be an intelligent machine.Take your iron for example. The electric iron understands that its temperature is beyond what is required and automatically switches itself off.We could say that the electric iron is intelligent as it can react to a particular state (the iron being hot), make a decision based on it and switch itself off. However, since the iron has not learned this through experience, it is not a truly intelligent machine.Scientists are creating new software programs which try to recreate the process of human learning in a computer, in an attempt to make them ‘think’. These programs try to copy the functioning of the brain. One such program is called a neural network.A neural networkOur brain is composed of millions of densely packed cells called neurons. Each neuron is like a tiny individual switch in a net of billions of such neurons.Whenever a particular piece of information, like someone’s telephone number reaches your brain, it creates a pattern of on and off switches using these neurons.Let’s use an example to understand this phenomenon. We put up garlands of electric lights to decorate our houses during Diwali. These lights create various patterns and designs, one switch creates a series of circles, another switch a pattern of flowers and so on.A neural network is like these garlands of lights: a particular input creates a particular pattern. Each nerve cell or neuron in our brain acts like a light bulb. It creates a particular pattern on receiving an input.When we memorise someone’s telephone number, we actually create a pattern in our brain. And when we try to remember the same number, we simply try to recreate that pattern, unlike the lights which need to be switched on or off everytime that pattern needs to be created.A neural network is a copy of the brain’s functioning inside a computer, using a software program. It can be taught to recognise patterns.In fact, when it is trained, it can classify and identify patterns in a large amount of information. It can do all this at very high speeds and sometimes faster than humans.This throws open innumerable possibilities. Imagine computers, which can look at the past weather and climate data, match them with current conditions and tell us where it is going to rain and how much.Turing’s testIn 1950, famous mathematician Alan M. Turing devised a method of testing a computer’s intelligence. A person is kept inside a closed cell and asked to speak to a hidden human being and a computer.The person, who is also called the interrogator (one who questions), does not have any clue about who is the human being and who the machine. His task is to find out which of the two candidates is the computer, and which is the human by asking them questions.If the interrogator is unable to decide within a certain time, the machine is considered intelligent. However, there has been no machine till date which has been able to pass the Turing’s test. This remains one of the biggest challenges of modern day computing.Although computing sciences have made a lot of progress, passing the Turing’s test might be difficult for computers for some time to come.","keyword":"[\"switch\", \"intelligent\", \"pattern\", \"computer\", \"machine\", \"brain\"]","ALS":"32.34615384615385"},{"english_id":"670","id":"671","level":"4","topic":"3","title":"What is Cloning?","article":"Which is the most famous sheep in the world? A sheep called Dolly. But why is Dolly famous?That is because unlike other sheep’s, Dolly was not born in the usual manner. She is actually a carbon copy of her mother, like an identical twin. This means that she is the twin sister of her mother who is older by six years and she does not have a father!Scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, UK, made history on 27th February 1997, when they successfully cloned a sheep. So what is cloning?We all have fathers and mothers, in fact all the animals we know of have them too. A clone, however, does not need to have both the parents.The miracle molecule: DNAOur bodies are made up of cells which have information to go about their work in the form of DNA or de-oxy-ribo-nucleic-acid. This is called the genetic code. Every organism gets half of this information from the father and the other half from the mother.We all have grown from a single cell which contains these two parts of the DNA. It is called the egg cell. It divides millions of times to give rise to the millions of cells which form our body.And each cell has a copy of all the genetic information needed by the body. This means that each cell of our body has enough information to create other human beings like us. All we need is an egg cell.In the process of cloning, the scientists extract the DNA from an animal cell and implant it into an egg cell taken from another animal. Before implanting it, the DNA of the recipient cell is removed.What is Cloning?This is how Dolly’s life began – from a single cell taken from the udder of her mother. The DNA in her mother’s cell was removed and transferred into the egg cell of another sheep. Five months later, Dolly was born and is now a healthy lamb, a clone of her mother (from whom her DNA was taken) – and without a biological father.It is technologically possible to clone humans as well. We might have clones of supermodels and great scientists. What if someone creates a clone of Hitler?

As humans take control over more and more natural processes – not necessarily for the betterment of civilisation – rain too seems to have finally been leashed in.Just like a farmer throws seeds on ploughed land to harvest plants, clouds can also be seeded with chemicals to induce rain! But to understand how cloud seeding works we must first learn some basic facts about the weather.Over 99 per cent of a cloud is air and air contains moisture. This moisture is the result of evaporation of water by the heat of the sun. When this warm air or water vapour rises from the earth’s surface and begins to cool, tiny droplets are formed and thus, clouds are made.For it to rain, temperatures inside the cloud need to be sub-zero, or below freezing point of water. When droplets of this super-cooled water meet specks of dust, salt or sand, they form small ice crystals (see image at the right). Water vapour in the cloud then freezes directly onto the surface of these crystals. When these crystals become too heavy to stay afloat, they fall as rain.Formation of such ice crystals takes a long time. Due to changes in climate, certain areas do not get adequate rain. Lack of rain dries up the land, causing drought. To avoid drought and to increase water resources, scientists have over the years studied cloud formations. They conclude that clouds lack ice nuclei. Therefore, they argue, additional ice nuclei should result in more rain-producing clouds.As an experiment, scientists sprayed a chemical called silver iodide or dry ice, onto a cloud formation. Sure enough, the chemical induced freezing of the water droplets, and what followed was rain. Silver iodide has a crystalline structure similar to that of ice and this increases ice crystal concentration.So the final recipe for rain is: one large cloud, though a bunch of smaller ones would do nicely too; a not too large serving of silver iodide (remember, too much and it’s called pollution) and the services of a plane. Shower the silver iodide onto the cloud. Blend well and serve cold. We now have rain!It’s important to plan things well. Since clouds don’t produce rain until 20 or 30 minutes after they have been seeded, one needs to make sure they deliver at the right place.The flow of air into the clouds and the liquid water content also suggests if a cloud is likely to produce rain.Cloud seeding is most commonly done out of airplanes. Planes fly into selected cloud formations and release packets of microscopic silver iodide particles using flares. When the particles meet cool moisture in the clouds, they trigger the formation of ice crystals and raindrops. The amount of silver iodide that is used is small enough to make sure that it doesn’t pose a pollution risk.Another method is to use smoke machines from the ground. The machines send silver iodide particles billowing from the ground into the atmosphere.So, the next time you feel like a rain dance, plan ahead. Make rain a part of the menu.","keyword":"[\"cloud\", \"iodide\", \"rain\", \"silver\", \"crystal\", \"moisture\"]","ALS":"25.25"},{"english_id":"672","id":"673","level":"4","topic":"19","title":"What is Cotton Candy?","article":"It’s sticky, it’s messy and it’s just the thing to eat at a fair.

First, he pours sugar into a small container set in the middle of a deep circular tray. Often, he adds a chemical called a colourant. This chemical is what gives colour to the candy (because sugar by itself is colourless).This small container (or holder) has incredibly teeny holes and contains an in-built heater that melts the sugar into a sticky liquid. The holder is connected to a small motor that causes it to rotate. As it spins incredibly fast, and liquid sugar splashes out of the tiny holes. As soon as the hot liquid hits the air, it cools, and solidifies, forming threads of sugar in the circular tray.The candy man then pops in a stick, deftly wraps these threads of candy around it and hands his creation to you!","keyword":"[\"candy\", \"sugar\", \"cotton\", \"holder\", \"fair\", \"circular\"]","ALS":"21.3125"},{"english_id":"675","id":"676","level":"4","topic":"16","title":"What is Geothermal Energy?","article":"In winter, all of us warm water in the geysers in the bathroom for bathing.

Sometimes water that seeps into the earth, through cracks in the rocks, comes in contact with this molten magma. This results in the water getting super-heated.This hot water can reach temperatures of more than 302 degrees fahrenheit or 150 degrees celsius. That’s a lot hotter than boiling water, which boils at 212 degrees fahrenheit or 100 degrees celsius. As the water heats up, it rises up to the surface of the earth and spews out of the cracks. This is the geyser.The steam and water that geysers throw up often makes a spectacular sight as the discharge comes out with so much force that it sometimes rises as high as 500m.What is Geothermal Energy?Geothermal energy to electricityThis heat energy, hidden under the surface of the earth, is called geothermal energy. Now, scientists across the world are trying to tap this energy to generate electricity and feed power stations.In fact, in several areas of California in America, this hot steam or water is pumped from under the ground to a power plant where it is used to generate electricity. Forty-six of California’s 58 counties have some type of geothermal resource of energy.However, geothermal energy is difficult to handle. First, there are very few areas of such geothermal activity. Secondly, the areas where such activities occur are highly prone to earthquakes. Lastly, the chemicals that come out of the earth, as part of the steam, can be very harmful to the machines and equipment used to generate electricity.","keyword":"[\"geothermal\", \"geyser\", \"spew\", \"energy\", \"steam\", \"degree\"]","ALS":"30.846153846153847"},{"english_id":"676","id":"677","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"What is Ham Radio?","article":"Consider this, your state has been hit by a cyclone with wind speeds measuring 300 kilometres per hour.

All communication links broke down as dish antennas, radio stations, telephone lines, satellite links were destroyed.There was no way people could contact the outside world. This was when a bunch of amateurs, students and radio enthusiasts got together to set up something called an amateur radio or ham radio station.What is Ham Radio?What is a HamHam is another name for an amateur radio set. It is actually a simple radio transmitter and receiver which can be built and setup using simple and low cost equipment. The ham radio receives radio signals just like your home radio set.The only difference is that your home radio set receives signals only from a radio station. A ham radio receives signals from another ham radio. So, each ham radio is like a radio-station-cum-radio-receiver built into one. It is actually like operating a radio station from your home.What you can do with a ham radioOnce you have your ham radio set operational, you can simply tune into a channel (like the radio stations you tune into) and send and receive radio messages to all those who are currently on that channel. It is like an online chat except that it is on a radio set.With a ham radio, you can connect to other people using ham radios across the globe. Several astronauts carry ham radio sets on their space voyages. If you are lucky, you can actually contact them. You can also contact trekkers or even explorers.However, you have to write exams to get a ham radio license. This license enables you to setup and operate a ham radio station.

While the milk was for health and energy, the almonds were for increasing the memory. I don’t know how much they helped, but I still offer them to my children in the hope that they do. After all, memory is a precious thing.No person really knows how much he or she remembers. I once tried to play a game with myself. I closed my eye and tried to recall everything I had ever seen – all the people, all the houses, all the streets, all the objects that I had ever looked at, and all the words and numbers I had ever learned.There seemed to be no end to the list of things that I could think of, so much so that in the end of it I got bored of the whole thing. But all this left me wondering – how could I remember so much, even the things that happened a long long time ago? How is it possible that their images are still so clear in my mind?Our brain is like a large filing cabinet with lots and lots of drawers and files. Whatever we see, hear or read, is filed and stored in this large memory bank. Millions and millions of impressions are stored away neatly, much like a library stocks books in its shelves. In fact our brain is the largest and most well-organized filing system in the world.Whenever we want to recall something, the correct drawer and the correct file opens and whatever it is we want to recall is easily remembered. Till date though, no one has figured out how impressions are filed in the photographic library of our brain .Unfortunately, sometimes parts of these impressions get lost or destroyed due to an accident or shock. For example, a person who has had a heady injury or a hemorrhage within the skull may lose parts of his memory or even all of it. He may even forget how to speak but he can read and write!The condition is referred to as amnesia or “memory blindness”. Amnesia can be caused by high tension, pressure or under periods of extreme anxiety. Amnesiacs forget certain associations and cannot recall them even if they are everyday items or people.Sometimes a severe fright or trauma can cause the brain to block-off certain portions of the memory. Amnesia can be treated by psychologists or psychiatrists. We often see these cases in Hindi movies, where a person loses his memory and in the end recovers fully, usually due to an incident that triggers-off the association, and restores the memory.Illustration of neural activityOld age is another reason why people lose their memory. When it happens in old age it is called senility and it is often referred to as second childhood as these people act and behave as a child as they can no longer recall simple everyday functions.However, even people with normal memory often forget simple everyday things like phone numbers or names of acquaintances. It is at the tip of the tongue but for that particular instant they are unable to recall it. This happens because they have not paid enough attention to store that information in the correct file and drawer of the brain. Perhaps they did not consider the matter important enough!Some people can glance at a page of a book and recall every word that is written on it. Is it a miracle? No, you and I could do it either. All we need are a concentration to detail and a desire to slot things in the orderly filing cabinet of the brain. Oh! And the almonds might help too.","keyword":"[\"recall\", \"memory\", \"file\", \"brain\", \"almond\", \"filing\"]","ALS":"25.85185185185185"},{"english_id":"682","id":"683","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"What is Ribotyping?","article":"Consider this, in a murder case, the culprit has left no clues. There are no fingerprints or eye witnesses.A perfect crime, you would say. But on close inspection, the crime branch discovers a tiny strand of hair. Back in the forensic laboratories, scientists use this strand of hair to track down the criminal and solve the murder case.But, how can you crack a mystery with a strand of hair, you would exclaim.The technique used by forensic scientists to track down the culprit is called DNA-fingerprinting. DNA stands for deoxy-ribo-nucleic acid. The DNA is present in every cell of our body and contains information needed by the cell to go about its activities.The DNA code for every individual is different and unique, just like our fingerprints. Forensic scientists know how to read this DNA code and tell one from another. This is what finally leads them to the culprit.What is Ribotyping?Now, scientists are using the technique of DNA mapping to track water pollution in coastal areas. Often, the sea is used as a garbage dump by humans. The garbage contains sewage water, which has a lot of faecal matter.But, it is very difficult to trace the source of these pollutants, since water reaches the sea through various channels. Until now, it was impossible to find out who the real pollutant culprit is.Now, scientists at the University of Missouri-Columbia, USA, are using DNA-fingerprinting to find whether the source of pollution is human or animal faeces. The key to this new technique lies in finding tiny bacteria called Escherichia Coli and identifying its strains in faeces.Escherichia Coli: The helpful bacteriaSeveral bacteria live in the guts of humans and other animals and help in digesting food. E. Coli is one such bacteria. What the scientists are planning to do is to try and find the presence of this bacteria in water. “Their detection in water warns of the possible presence of disease-causing strains of Escherichia coli, salmonella, or hepatitis virus”, says professor Andrew Carson.Since there are several strains of this bacteria which inhabit the stomachs of animals, scientists (have to fill in data) are attempting to create a library of E. Coli strains found in humans and other animals.Once a sample is collected from the beach water, it can be compared against the samples in the library for the presence of that particular strain that inhabits human stomachs. This will tell the biologists whether the source of pollution is human or animal sewage. This technology is called ribo-typing.Once the cause is found, the pollution causing sewer or drain (since there are separate drains for humans and animal farms) can be easily identified and checked.","keyword":"[\"coli\", \"bacteria\", \"strain\", \"forensic\", \"library\", \"culprit\"]","ALS":"28.764705882352942"},{"english_id":"684","id":"685","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"What is Water Harvesting?","article":"Come summer and the entire nation seems to have just one word on its lips – water.

Is it?During the monsoons every year, we allow huge amounts of fresh water to run off our roads and pavements into the drains where it mixes with the sewage and heads straight for the rivers where we dump waste. Did you know that this rain water is enough to see us through the summers?When the summer months arrive, the rivers usually dry up. And our water needs increase. This puts pressure on other sources of water, like ground water. As a result, our tube wells and bore wells start working overtime.This is why ground water levels are going down across the country. Where earlier water could be found at a depth of 20 feet, now we have to dig as deep as 200 feet.What is Water Harvesting?There is an easy solutionConsider this. If we were to collect all the water which rains on our terrace, roads and pavements instead of letting it run into the ditches, we could actually have vast reserves of water.All we need to do this is create rain water tanks to store water. If water tanks and reserves are expensive and difficult to maintain, we could even dig huge pits and make open reservoirs. These reservoirs would not only collect the rain water but also allow it to seep into the ground and raise the ground water level.This type of water management and storage of rain water is called water harvesting.It is actually a very old technique that has been used by a lot of traditional societies for generations. Water tanks, check dams, storage wells and reservoirs are dotted all over rural India and have seen villagers through several summers. In Kishori village of Alwar district in Rajasthan, farmers have made Johads or check dams to trap rain water and store them in huge reservoirs.As water scarcity increases, we will also have to look towards such traditional but revolutionary water management methods.","keyword":"[\"water\", \"rain\", \"summer\", \"reservoir\", \"tank\", \"pavement\"]","ALS":"28.642857142857142"},{"english_id":"685","id":"686","level":"4","topic":"6","title":"What is a Kangaroo Rat?","article":"It looks like a small kangaroo for its hind legs are longer than its fore legs.

You might ask why. The answer is that these three villages were washed away by an ocean wave that was more like a giant wall of water. It goes by the name tsunami, a Japanese term meaning a harbour wave.A tsunami is caused by a disturbance in the sea floor, just like the disturbances on land. It may take the form of a quake or volcanic eruption or landslides on the ocean floor. Imagine the slab-like pieces of the sea floor, each of which may be hundreds of kilometres long. And imagine these slabs moving against each other, forcing one or the other upwards.This upward movement simply pushes the water up. The movement of water is from the deeper parts of the ocean into the shallower parts. And since the shallow parts of the ocean cannot withstand the force of the incoming water, it has only one way to go – and that is up, up and up, creating a huge wave.Basic types of tsunamiThis giant wall of water can reach up to 20 to 30 metres. This ocean wave has the power to come down on land settlements, destroying them immediately. Sometimes tsunamis travel thousands of miles before reaching land. This is what happened to the three fishing villages in Papua New Guinea last year, when a 23 metre wall of water struck them. Almost 6000 people died there and then.","keyword":"[\"ocean\", \"wall\", \"papua\", \"tsunami\", \"village\", \"fishing\"]","ALS":"21.23076923076923"},{"english_id":"689","id":"690","level":"4","topic":"6","title":"What is a virus?","article":"Viruses are these tiny, invisible structures that cause infections. They make us sick. There are millions of viruses in our environment but only about 5000 have been identified by scientists. The ones you may have heard of are the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV and the Novel Coronavirus or Covid-19.What do viruses look like?Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Do you think that a virus is some creepy, crawly thing? It is not. A virus is a non-living thing. It is invisible to the human eye. A virus is one hundred times smaller than a bacteria, which is why most viruses cannot be seen even under a microscope.So how does a virus make someone sick?To make someone sick, a virus needs a host. The host is that living creature inside which the virus can multiply and spread, and generally make a nuisance of itself. The host could be a human body, an animal, or even as tiny as a bacteria. First, the virus needs to enter the living body. It could enter through blood or saliva or even sneeze droplets. Next, the virus turns that living body into a virus photocopying machine. Once infected by a virus, a living body starts creating multiple copies of the virus. Before you know it, that body is bursting with viruses and is sick.And how does a virus spread?To spread from a body full of a virus to a body that does not have the virus, the virus needs a way. Imagine an elevator, taking the virus from one body to the next. In the case of HIV, the elevator that carries the virus from one body to the next is blood, saliva or semen. Let us take the example of a person infected with HIV. If they have a bleed, and they touch someone else who also has a cut in their skin, and their bloods mix, then the HIV virus could enter the second person. Some viruses, like Covid-19, travel in the tiny droplets that come out of our bodies when we cough or sneeze. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, then droplets of fluid carry the virus out. If you are close enough, then the virus will go up your nose and into your lungs. These types of viruses are called respiratory viruses, because they affect our breathing.

All is well with the world. It’s a beautiful sunny day and you are sitting drinking your morning tea or coffee relaxed and enjoying the day. Suddenly there is a rattling of plates and glasses. Within seconds chairs and tables are rocking violently, the fans sway crazily and crockery is falling off the shelves. Help!! Sometimes plaster falls from the ceiling, walls develop cracks or worse still, they collapse. The very earth is shaking!This shaking motion is called an earthquake, the result of a sudden release of energy from below the surface of the earth. Few disasters can cause such havoc as an earthquake.Earthquakes have rocked the world since time immemorial. But what causes it? The earth can be divided into four main layers: the solid inner core, the liquid outer core, the mantle, and the crust. An earthquake is caused by a sudden rupture in a fault. A fault is the fracture within the rocky mass inside the earth’s crust. The depth and length of faults vary greatly.Rescue team is searching for the wounded aftter the earthquake. Prometheus72 \/ Shutterstock.comStress in the earth’s outer layer cause a pushing effect against the sides of the fault. Due to this motion, rocks slip or collide against each other releasing energy. This released energy travels in waves through the earth’s crust and causes the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.Faults are divided into three main groups. Reverse fault – when two plates collide and one side of the fracture moves on top of another; normal fault -when two plates are moving apart; and strike-slip or lateral – when two plates slide past each other.Under the surface of the earth, the two sides of a fault are constantly moving, relative to one another. This movement is known as a fault slip. The movement of these two sides is not smooth and is accompanied by a gradual build-up of elastic strain energy within the rocks along the fault. The rocks store this strain like a giant spring being slowly wound up.Eventually, the strain along the fault becomes too much and the rocks can no longer bear the tension. The fault then ruptures with a sudden movement releasing all the energy built up over the years. This energy is released in the form of vibrations called ‘seismic waves’.These waves travel along the surface and through the earth at varying speeds depending on the material through which they move. It is actually these seismic waves that cause most of the destructive effects, which we associate with earthquakes.The location on a fault where the slip first occurs is called the hypocentre, whereas the position directly above it on the ground surface is called the epicentre.When these seismic waves reach the surface of the earth, they give rise to strong ground motion causing building and other man-made structures to shake or collapse or develop cracks and fissures.Earthquakes can also cause landslides, sudden eruptions as in the case of a hot lava flow from a volcano or giant waves called tsunamis. Sometimes new land mass are also formed. Such earthquakes are attributed with the creation of the greatest undersea mountain range (stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean and under the Pacific Ocean) and the longest land mountain range (the Himalaya-Karakoram range).It is estimated that there are 5,00,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. Of these only 1,00,000 are felt, and only 100 of them cause actual damage.Though there are certain parts of the earth where earthquakes are frequent, the majority of earthquakes occur along the earth’s plate boundaries, which carry the continents and the ocean floor. They occur most between the Pacific plate and the North American plate commonly referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire.Although it is known why earthquakes occur, there is no reliable method of accurately predicting the time, place and magnitude of an earthquake. So if you feel the earth shake under your feet, you are either in love or it is an earthquake you are experiencing.","keyword":"[\"fault\", \"earthquake\", \"plate\", \"earth\", \"wave\", \"sudden\"]","ALS":"26.551724137931036"},{"english_id":"692","id":"693","level":"4","topic":"19","title":"What is an Orca?","article":"If you have seen the movie Free Willy, you would be able to instantly recognise an Orca.

Remember the South African pace bowler Alan Donald or ‘White Lightning’ as he is called, with “war-paint” on his face? No, it is not an attempt at camouflage, simply an effort to gain protection from the ultraviolet rays of the sun.And therein lies a paradox – it is the light and heat of the sun that sustains life on earth, but among its many friendly rays are some harmful ones as well. These ultraviolet (UV, as they are called in all popular sunscreen lotions) rays can kill life forms, including humans, if they are exposed to it beyond a limit.What is the Ozone Hole?Ultraviolet: Is it a shade of violet?The white sunlight that we see, is formed of seven different colours, or the VIBGYOR – short for violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. Violet is at one end, while red is at the other extreme of this visible band of light.Only that light which falls between these colours, is visible to humans. Light rays which fall below the violet colour, are called ultraviolet rays. Those that fall beyond the colour red are called infrared. Sunlight contains both ultraviolet and infrared rays.How are we protected from these rays?These rays have always been a part of sunlight, but they have become big threats to humans today. Why? The earth’s atmosphere is composed of several layers. We live in the Troposphere where most of the weather patterns such as rain, snow and clouds, occur. Above the troposphere is the Stratosphere.Supersonic jet airliners such as the Concorde fly in this layer, whereas subsonic commercial airliners usually fly in the troposphere. It is in the stratosphere that the ultraviolet rays strike the oxygen, converting it into a gas called ozone.Friendly ozone layerThe ozone in the stratosphere absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. These rays can otherwise cause skin cancer and damage vegetation, among other things. Exposure to these ultraviolet rays kills bacterias and several microorganisms that are very important for the earth’s ecology. Unfortunately, this layer is getting depleted.The ozone layer has a hole in itIn 1996 studies conducted by US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revealed a big hole of roughly 10 million square miles (greater than the total surface area of North America) over the continent of Antarctica. This is known as the ozone hole. As a result of this large amount of ultraviolet rays enter the lower atmosphere. If not checked in time the ozone depletion can cause dangerous consequences.Human hand in ozone depletion.Quite interestingly the destruction of ozone is a human phenomenon. Like air pollution, reducing the levels of pollutants that we emit in the atmosphere, can control it. Most air-conditioners, refrigerators and spray cans contain a substance called CFC (chlorofluorocarbons) that destroys the ozone gas, converting it into other gases. This is what has caused the ozone hole over a period of time.It is precisely for this reason that worldwide standards for air-conditioning equipments are being modified. A new substance called HFC (hydrofluorocarbons) is being used instead of CFC.So, the next time you use that room freshener or your perfume spray, think of the ozone hole that could be expanding with every passing second.","keyword":"[\"ozone\", \"ultraviolet\", \"violet\", \"troposphere\", \"airliner\", \"infrared\"]","ALS":"27.652173913043477"},{"english_id":"696","id":"697","level":"4","topic":"8","title":"What is the Secret of the Windmill?","article":"It was a particularly windy day in late July when my cousin and I sat down to make a pinwheel.

Seeing it, our hearts pin-wheeled as well.Energy from windA few days later we happened to see the photograph of a windmill in a magazine. “Don’t these windmills look exactly like the pinwheels we made?” my cousin shouted. And what did we find? That they are actually similar! Like the pinwheel, the windmill also uses the wind’s energy to turn the blades on a large wheel. This movement of the blades is used to pump water, generate electricity or pound grain.The land of windmillsOf course many others have recognised the strength of wind power. It is clean and it does not create pollution. Countries, which have abundance of wind power, have derived large benefits from wind energy.Traditional Dutch windmill in the NetherlandsTake Holland, for example. Why is it called the land of windmills? Because most of its land lies below sea level, and windmills are used to pump water into canals from low-lying areas that are filled with water. In the 17th century there were over 8,000 windmills in use in Holland!No wonder, as pollution rises, people in other parts of the world are slowly realising the power of simple solutions such as windmills. The pinwheel, too, has great power.","keyword":"[\"windmill\", \"pinwheel\", \"wind\", \"holland\", \"power\", \"blade\"]","ALS":"19.933333333333334"},{"english_id":"697","id":"698","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"What is the Software for Life?","article":"We all use computers. If you use Windows on your machine, like me, you will have a small button at the the bottom of your screen called ‘Start’. Every machine in the world which has the Windows software installed has to have that button. However, we can have different screen colours, different text sizes, wallpapers etc.Similarly our bodies are essentially the same, but we have different colours, sizes, shapes and structures. Our body also has a software which is responsible for these differences between one human being and another. It is called the DNA.Digital illustration DNA structureWhere and what is the software?We all know that every living organism is made up of small units called cells. These cells are the building block of a organism. The human body is nothing but a collection of millions of such cells. Each cell performs a specific task in our body, the blood cells carry oxygen and food while the cells of our skin protect and give us colour.But how does a cell know what it has to do? Imagine what would happen if the skin cells performed the functions of our blood cells.The nucleus and the genetic codeEvery cell has a tiny compartment inside it, this is called the nucleus. All the information about the cell’s job is written on a molecule called the DNA and stored inside the nucleus. We could say the nucleus is like the hard-disk of your computer. This information is called the genetic code.DNA or deoxyribonucleic (spelled de-oxy-ribo-nucleic) acid, is the master molecule of life on earth. It is shaped liked a twisted ladder called a double helix. The ladder has rungs made up of four different molecular parts. These rungs, called the nucleotides, spell out the hereditary instructions for making a given organism.Every life form on earth has a different set of instructions. That is why one animal is different from another and why you are taller than your father.When an organism reproduces, it passes on its DNA to its offspring. When you were born, you got half of your DNA from your father and the other half from your mother. This is the reason why some of your features are like those of your mother while others like your father.Every creature on earth, be it a plant or an animal carries the DNA in it. The DNA is the wonder molecule which propagates life on earth.","keyword":"[\"cell\", \"nucleus\", \"software\", \"ladder\", \"rung\", \"organism\"]","ALS":"22.2"},{"english_id":"698","id":"699","level":"4","topic":"19","title":"What is the Trail behind a Jet?","article":"When we were small, we used to look up to the sky and often see a white trail left by a jet aircraft. Rocket! Rocket! We used to yell, jump up with joy, clap our hands and strain our eyes as the ‘rocket’ disappeared into the horizon.Soon, the white streak would change into a broken, twisted cloud path. And we were told that it was the fairies’ trail.What is the Trail behind a Jet?What causes this white streak?The white streak is actually a cloud, though the aircraft is a normal jet liner and not a rocket. This white streak is called a ‘contrail’ or a condensation trail. The engine of a jet aircraft releases after- burners or fumes just like our cars and motorcycles.These fumes contain a lot of water vapour. At very high altitudes, where the temperature is as low as -38 degree celsius (water freezes at zero degrees), the water vapour freezes into tiny ice crystals almost instantly before evaporating.A contrail can spread out and form a horizontal sheet of cloud, as winds which blow at high altitudes blow it apart. It disappears eventually when the water vapour evaporates.Contrail or chemtrail?The fumes emanating from an aircraft contain several harmful chemicals which pollute the air at high altitudes. So, environmentalists have coined a new term for it – chemtrail or chemical trail. So much for the fairies’ trail.","keyword":"[\"trail\", \"streak\", \"rocket\", \"aircraft\", \"fume\", \"altitude\"]","ALS":"24"},{"english_id":"699","id":"700","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"What is the Weight of Air?","article":"As you stand in the middle of a playground or while you are sitting in your class, there is an immense weight right over your head, but you do not feel it! This is the weight of the atmosphere, or air, as we know it.Composed of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases, it surrounds the earth like an envelope. And, it extends almost a thousand kilometres above the Earth’s surface.Like all other substances, air also has weight. Imagine, we are actually talking about a thousand-kilometre high column of air above our heads. This is known as the atmospheric pressure.Barometer measures atmospheric pressureWhy don’t our bones get crushed under this weight?Actually, our bodies have an internal pressure, which counters that of the atmospheric pressure and, in the process, balances it out. This internal pressure is essential for our survival.A little change in the atmospheric pressure can make us feel sick. This is the reason why mountaineers get sick at high altitudes. As we go higher, the air becomes thin and hence, the atmospheric pressure also decreases.How is it measured?It is measured as weight of the atmosphere for a given area. Or, the amount of weight on a small area, such as a centimetre. In 1643, Evangelista Torricelli, an Italian mathematician, invented an instrument to measure atmospheric pressure. It is called the barometer.A barometer consists of an empty tube from which air has been taken out. This tube is inverted into a dish of mercury. Since the dish of mercury is subjected to the pressure of the air above it, some of the mercury is pushed into the tube.The level to which mercury rises is measured in inches and this indicates the atmospheric pressure. On a clear day (clouds and high winds can alter atmospheric pressure), at sea level, mercury rises to a height of 29.792 inches (76 centimetres), in a barometer. This is equal to 14.70 pounds (6.6 kilograms) per square inch of area. Hence, at sea level, we carry about 6.6 kilograms of weight on every inch of our body.","keyword":"[\"atmospheric\", \"mercury\", \"pressure\", \"weight\", \"measure\", \"barometer\"]","ALS":"24.875"},{"english_id":"701","id":"702","level":"4","topic":"8","title":"What kind of Family Life did the Dinosaurs Have?","article":"In Argentina this year, scientists digging on a site made a fantastic discovery, which made them realise that dinosaurs lived as a large family. The site consisted of many nests with each nest containing as many as 15 to 30 eggs. The eggs belonged to a plant-eating dinosaur called Titanosaurs. It is the biggest nesting site of dinosaurs found so far.The word dinosaur is a Greek word meaning giant reptile. Most reptiles lay eggs in nests but they walk away after the young hatch to fend for themselves.However, the discovery of this site and an earlier site discovered in 1978 in Montana, USA, has made scientists change their views about the dinosaurs.In Montana, eggs and skeletons of adults, babies and young teen dinosaurs were all found in one site. In other areas fossil footprints were found in large numbers suggesting that these dinosaurs lived as a family and travelled as a herd.At other sites the dinosaurs had communal nesting sites, or nests at the same place. These nesting sites or rookery are similar to current day turtle nesting sites in Orissa, India, where a large number of turtles come together to lay eggs.Scientists have also discovered that flesh-eating dinosaurs sometimes hunted in packs. Two or three of them would attack a single prey and kill it. This is unusual as it was thought that only mammals like the wolves hunt in packs.

Here you are enjoying an afternoon snooze, or having a cup of coffee in the morning or even sleeping under a quilt on a cold winter night when WHAM! The entire crockery shelf collapses shattering plates and cups; the painting on the wall nearly knocks you down as it falls; or the antique fan looks like it will brain you as it hangs down, held by a single wire!What does one do in such situations? There is no advance warning on prime time news nor is there a particular time of year, like monsoons, when an earthquake always occurs. Unlike a tornado or hurricane there are no known methods of predicting an earthquake. Scientists have, however, managed to chart out areas of the world that is earthquake prone, like the San Andreas Fault in North America, the Great African rift, etc. But knowing the area is prone to quakes and being in the centre of one are two different things.What to do During an Earthquake?Though it is estimated that about 5,00,000 earthquakes occur each year, only 100 of them cause damage! However, an earthquake could occur any time of the day or night so it pays to be prepared if you are unfortunately caught in the middle of one. There are certain dos and don’ts that can help you during an earthquake.If you are indoors, stay indoors unless you are in the ground floor (first floor to Americans) where you can easily run outside. The best thing to do if you are indoors is to hide under a sturdy piece of furniture like a bed or desk. Do not try to head for the stairway if you are living in an upper storey, as chances are the stairways may collapse.Stay away from windows, inside walls and movable furniture or appliances. The kitchen is a dangerous place as things stored in cupboards can fall on you. Don’t try to rush downstairs or outdoors while the building is shaking. There is greater danger of falling debris, glass, or staircases collapsing under your feet.If you are outdoors, try to reach an open ground. Stay away from high-rise buildings, trees, power and telephone cables or anything else that might fall on you.If you are driving on the road get out of the traffic and stop on a clear stretch of the road. Do not stop on a bridge or for that matter under one. Stay inside your car until the shaking stops. Before you resume driving, look out for fissures, breaks in the road, bumps and cracks. try to reach an open ground if you can.Inside your home, be careful not to turn on the gas until you are sure the cylinder is safe and there is no gas leak.Try not to use your telephone unless there is an emergency. You could be tying up lines needed for someone else’s emergency.Ensure you establish a meeting place with all family members in case you get separated. Transportation and aid may be disrupted for some days. In case you have to camp out till such time normalcy is restored, have some emergency supplies handy like medical supplies, flashlights, a portable radio for the news, adequate water in bottles, canned food, blankets, etc.Lastly, if you are not trapped or seriously hurt, do not expect fire fighters, army, police or paramedics to help you. They may be busy rescuing others who are in greater need than you are!","keyword":"[\"earthquake\", \"indoors\", \"shatter\", \"furniture\", \"road\", \"stairway\"]","ALS":"28.217391304347824"},{"english_id":"703","id":"704","level":"4","topic":"16","title":"What were the Voyager Missions?","article":"Imagine a journey that takes you a billion kilometres away from earth, to the edge of the solar system, from where you can look back over your shoulder and see our sun as just another star in the sky.We are not talking about a science fiction movie but the Voyager space mission.

Voyager 2 followed a couple of months later because it had taken a longer path. They circled the giant planet and a few of its moons. They also took close-up photographs of the mammoth planet.These photographs show a giant storm, three times the size of Earth, raging on Jupiter. This area stands out on any picture of the planet as a dark red sore and it is rightly called the ‘Great red spot’. The Voyagers discovered and sent back photographs of an active volcano on Io, one of Jupiter’s moons.From Jupiter, the Voyagers continued their journey to Saturn and Uranus. They discovered several thousand ‘ringlets’ around Saturn apart from the rings man already knew about. They also closely inspected Titan, one of the moons of Saturn.What is interesting about Titan is that its atmosphere looked like what the earth must have been before life evolved on it.

Behind the ears, on his body. He whips about trying to chew up his tail. What’s eating him? You part the hair and feel around. It’s a flea!Fleas are parasitic insects that suck the blood of birds and mammals. There are over 2,400 flea species worldwide classified under the order Siphonaptera. They are tiny wingless insects like the lice in our hair, either black or reddish brown.The flea body is flattened and has many spines and bristles, like a porcupine, all over its body. Fleas are found on cats and dogs and are very common during summers and humid rainy weather.This body design of spiny bristles allow easy movement between the fur of animals. These insects have six legs with a small claw at the tip to enable it to stay attached to the skin even as the animal scratches forcefully.Fleas are very agile and great jumpers. Though they are less than an inch, they can jump seven-eighth of an inch vertically and 14 to 16 inches horizontally. This is equal to a human jumping 600 feet in the air!Fleas are attracted to animals by body heat, movement and the carbon dioxide they exhale. They are normally found near the neck, behind the armpits or firmly attached in between the paws.Both male and female fleas suck blood and if the flea cannot find a dog or cat, they will even bite other animals and humans.An average dog flea lives for about 100 days. A female flea lays about 25 eggs a day and over a 1000 in her lifetime. By the time a flea pair dies they and their family could produce millions of other fleas! A female flea consumes 15 times its body weight in blood daily.A flea bite leaves a red itchy mark that is quite itchy. Although dog or cat fleas are not carriers of any specific disease, other fleas like the rat flea can transmit diseases like the typhus or bubonic plague.However, the flea is also a circus attraction. In a flea circus, these fleas are exhibited and made to show off their jumping prowess.

For it would be difficult for those creatures to escape a predator’s hold. Till now there was no actual proof of this fact. But latest research by French scientists in Paris, France, has proved that it is true. A report on their research came out in ‘The Economist’ magazine recently. How did they do it?The scientists studied the hunting habits of domestic cats. And they studied the health of birds that were killed by cats with those killed in accidents. They made a detailed study of one organ or part of the birds’ bodies which was an indication of its good health. That organ was the spleen.The scientists chose the spleen because of a particular reason. Birds that are healthy have larger sized spleens than those which keep getting infections. The spleen greatly helps in strengthening the birds’ immune system or their capacity to fight disease. So from the size of the spleen the French scientists could find out if the birds killed by domestic cats were healthy or sickly.When a cat hunts a bird for lunchThey examined more than 500 birds from 18 different species and made very interesting discoveries. The spleens of birds killed by cats were much smaller than those killed in accidents. It means that they were not very healthy. This was true of 16 out of the 18 species they studied. By and large the spleens of birds killed in accidents were three times larger than the spleens of birds killed by domestic cats.Also most of the birds killed by the cats were young. Of those that died in accidents, half were young and half were adult. So while it is true that the young and the sickly birds are at a greater danger of becoming a cat’s lunch or dinner, old birds are able to take care of themselves.","keyword":"[\"spleen\", \"bird\", \"kill\", \"accident\", \"domestic\", \"healthy\"]","ALS":"19.88888888888889"},{"english_id":"707","id":"708","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"When will the Oceans of the Earth Overflow?","article":"Try this out. Plug the sink and leave the water running. It will lead to a flood in the bathroom and a scolding for letting the water overflow. Since the sink could not hold an unlimited amount of water, it let the water spill out.But even the oceans are enormous bodies of water that get flooded with water from rain, melting ice, and rivers year after year. Will they start overflowing too? If so, when? And, where will they go?The answer is, never. Despite the deluge of water, our oceans will never overflow.The reason lies in the earth’s water circulation system, also known as the hydrologic cycle.Earth is known as “the water planet”. Seventy percent of its surface is made up of water – it amounts to a staggering 1.36 billion metric tones. It covers an area that is nine times larger than the Moon’s surface. But this water is neither added to, nor subtracted from the planet for the simple reason that it is in constant motion, cycling through the oceans, the air, the land, and back to the oceans again.The oceans contain the bulk of earth’s water – 97.2 percent. Ice caps and glaciers, ground water, atmosphere, rivers, lakes and marshes together make up less than three percent of the earth’s waterThe cycle begins as the sun makes the water evaporate from oceans, lakes, rivers and soil. Transpiration releases more water vapour in the air. Transpiration is the process by which plants extract water from the ground and release it through their leaves. The vapour then condenses as rain or snow, 75 per cent of which falls on the oceans. The remainder pours on the land, river and lakes as rain. Some of the water then seeps into the earth as groundwater, while some is returned to the sea.So, that is why the oceans are never in danger of overflowing.","keyword":"[\"ocean\", \"overflow\", \"water\", \"percent\", \"transpiration\", \"river\"]","ALS":"21.41176470588235"},{"english_id":"709","id":"710","level":"4","topic":"4","title":"Where Did Piggy Banks Come From?","article":"You can find a piggy bank at almost every home. But whoever heard of pigs and savings? Pigs in a poke, yes, and pigs in a sty. But what is the connection between the sty residents and a home saving bank?Actually none. The connecting link has to do with clay. Clay? Yes. Though coin-slotted money boxes in the shape of animals, including pigs have been in existence for centuries, the actual term came to be associated with Europe in the middle ages.In the 15th and 16th century Europe, there were no banks to put your money into. What money people saved had to kept at home. But people earned so little that they wanted to save some money for a rainy day.Traditional clay piggy-banksThe only way they could was to put it in pots and jars. The jars were mostly made of hardened clay as metal was a costly item then and people couldn’t afford to buy a metal jar. Pots, pans, jars and other household items were made of an orange-coloured clay known as “pygg”.People would use a jar made of “pygg” to save or “bank” what money they could. When banking started, people realised that what they were saving in “pygg” moneyboxes at home was personal banking!Slowly over time, this “pygg bank” became corrupted to become “pig bank”. In the 19th century, potters who had heard the term decided to make a coin-saving moneybox in the shape of a pig.Pigs, in fact, have always been the poor man’s asset. A pig would be fed leftovers and scraps of the table and be fattened for the butcher at the end of the year. In a similar vein, a piggy bank is fed coins left over from the monthly expenses, and at the end smashed to take the saved money out.Within a short time this figurine caught people’s fancy. Fancy pig-shaped money-boxes came into the market in all shapes and sizes, with cute noses, and curly tails. Naturally this caught the attention of the children and the rest is pig-banking history.

No, they are NOT found near the North Pole. Scientists feel that these birds became flightless as food was available in plenty. But their food was located underwater so they adapted to the sea with short flipper-like wings.Penguins have short legs and when they want to move fast, they slide on the ice on their bellies. Penguins eat fish and squid and live in large colonies called rookeries. There are 18 penguin species ranging from the smallest, the Little Blue at 40 cm to the Emperor Penguins at 120 cm. Only two species – the Adelie and the Emperor penguin – live in the Antarctic.Penguins are excellent swimmers and this is where they use their wings. These birds use their wings to propel themselves in the water and also take short flights, like hens, out of the water to come on to land. Their dives may last up to 15 minutes and they can reach speeds of 35 kilometres per hour.Penguins are well adapted to the sea and the bitter cold of the southern pole. To keep the water out of their body, they have oily, thickly-packed feathers that also help retain heat. A layer of thick fat protects them from the icy cold.In late September, hundreds of thousands of penguins move to their breeding ground to mate. Each year the same pair of penguins mate. The female lays one or two eggs. Both male and female penguins take care of the eggs. The eggs are clutched tightly with the feet under their soft stomachs.After eight weeks, the eggs hatch and the chick sits on the parents feet, as the ground is still too cold for its bottom! When the chicks are three weeks old, they join a crèche. These crèches are not what you think.A crèche here is a group of penguins huddled together for warmth. A crèche consists of thousands of little chicks taken care of by a few adults. Penguin parents cannot identify their own babies in this crowd of chicks.When the parent arrives with food, it stays outside the crowd and squawks loudly. The chick on hearing the parent’s voice, comes running. Sometimes other hungry chicks, too, follow, but the parents now recognise their chicks by their persistence.During the harsh winter months, adults also huddle in tight groups for warmth. However, if they get too hot they fluff their feathers and hold out their wings.It is mistakenly thought that when in a huddled group, penguins on the outside change places with penguins on the inside after a while. Actually it’s the survival of the fittest. Some penguins have to be on the outside of any group. These are constantly trying to get inside the group for warmth. So it looks as if the group is constantly in motion with members changing places.","keyword":"[\"penguin\", \"chick\", \"cr\\u00e8che\", \"warmth\", \"flightless\", \"huddle\"]","ALS":"21.307692307692307"},{"english_id":"717","id":"718","level":"4","topic":"14","title":"Where is the Rare Blind Dolphin Found?","article":"What comes to mind at the mention of Varanasi? The peals of temple bells in this ancient pilgrim town; people performing puja at the ghats and elsewhere; bodies being cremated at the banks of the river Ganga. Do dolphins come to mind?Dolphins?! That happy looking performing artist which looks more like a shiny inflated balloon toy? Yes, and this freshwater dolphin is a rare specie, found in Indian and Pakistan – in the Ganga and in the Indus.That is not to say that this dolphin does not have eyes. It has eyes but no lenses. Thus all that it can see is day and night. Beyond that, the world is an unknown sight to the mammal. Like many other sightless creatures of the animal kingdom, they, too, judge distances through sounds and their echoes.Ten years ago, there were over 6000 dolphins who often gave the grave and sober mood of Varanasi a playful twist with their flips through the air, says a report in ‘Exploring the River Front of My Town’, a beautiful information and activity book produced by well-known Indian theatre personality Feisal Alkazi and Priti Jain.Today, barely 3000 dolphins remain in the Ganga and its tributaries and the reasons are not far to guess. For no river has been talked about so much in recent years for the rising pollution in it than the Ganga.One reason is the increasing level of toxic pesticides in the river into which the water from agricultural fields merges at various points. And farmers have been using greater amounts of pesticides over the years. The pesticides gather in the fat layer of the mammal, leading to a slow death.Volunteers rescue a freshwater dolphin that was stuck at Rohri Canal in Sukkur on the west bank of river Indus in Pakistan. Asianet-Pakistan \/ Shutterstock.comEarlier, the dolphins would migrate during the breeding season. But since the construction of the Farakka barrage, their journeys have been halted. So they breed less too. A barrage is an artificial dam created to divert the flow of water to new channels.The introduction of nylon nets by fishermen has meant that more and more dolphins are getting caught in them and being killed. Dolphin oil is used by the fishermen as a bait for catfish.The story is not very different in Pakistan either. Earlier, the mammal was lord of a watery territory that stretched across 2,800 km, in the Indus river. Now its home has shrunk to barely 170 km, between two dams.They are hunted creatures here as well, states the report, which has been published by Centre for Environment Education, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.There is a very important fact that is being missed out. The dolphin occupies pride of place or the topmost position in the food chain. Below it are the smaller creatures down to the smallest, all of whom are food for the creature a little bigger than them.As long as the dolphin stays healthy, it is a signal that nothing has disturbed the food chain and the delicate balance in nature is being maintained. It means that the river system and the nearby ecosystem, too, are in good shape.The worry starts when the big boss of the food chain starts showing signs of wasting and dies. It means that something has gone terribly wrong in the environment.It means that we must not be blind to the fate of the “blind” dolphins.","keyword":"[\"dolphin\", \"river\", \"pakistan\", \"blind\", \"indus\", \"ganga\"]","ALS":"26.91304347826087"},{"english_id":"719","id":"720","level":"4","topic":"3","title":"Where is the Twins Day Festival Held?","article":"Are you a twin?

Every year, in August, twins from all over the world gather at Twinsburg, Ohio, for a special day dedicated to twins and for a weekend of socialising, celebration and fun?The Twins Days festival at Twinsburg is the world’s largest annual gathering of twins. It’s a big club-like event in which twins, “doubles”, triplets, quadruplets and their parents come to this small town near Cleveland.The first Twins Day was held in August 1976 with only 37 pairs of twins. Since then, this festival has been held without fail, drawing record duos from every corner of the globe. It was in fact a coincidence that the city chosen for this festive day was called Twinsburg.Twins are children born of the same mother and within minutes of each other. A woman having one baby at a time is most common. Twins are not so common. On rarer occasions, three babies or triplets, or four babies called quadruplets may be born.How do twins form? Each baby grows from a single cell. Sometimes the cell splits into two. Or sometimes two cells begin to grow. When this happens two babies grow inside the mother. Two babies growing at the same time inside the mother are called twins.Twins that come from one cell that splits into two will look alike. These twins are called identical twins or “doubles”. Twins that come from two different cells will not look alike and are called “fraternal twins”. Twins that look alike are always either two boys or two girls. A fraternal twin may look like each other but are not exactly the same.Portrait of two little girl twinsMost twins do not look alike. Identical twins or doubles is a rare phenomenon. The Twin Day festival was thus organised to recognise this biological miracle.In 1976, the year the United States celebrated 200 years of independence, a group of people decided to set aside a day for twins.Since July was the month dedicated for the celebrations (July 4 is United States’ Independence day) August was chosen to celebrate the festival.The Twins Day Festival in August 1976 started with a flag hoisting at the city square. There were 37 sets of twins in attendance that first year.The organisers did not want the festival to be a one-off affair. So the next year they planned it better and ensured the festival continued at the same venue.There were heated arguments whether Twins Day should be limited to a local affair or to a festival dedicated to children of multiple births. In 1979 the festival went international with two sets of twins arriving from abroad – one pair from Lebanon and another from Poland. The same year, the Twins Day Committee was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation.Today, the Twins Day attracts 2,736 pairs of twins from every state in the USA and others from all over the globe. From baby twins to people in the eighties and nineties!You can attend too if you are interested – if not to participate at least as a spectator.

Birds, reptiles and insects lay eggs. But as with every other rule, this one has exceptions* too.An exceptional exceptionThe duck-billed platypus of Australia walks out of fresh waters to build its nest on the ground. But it has retained its love of water and returns to streams and ponds to eat crayfish, snails, and shrimp. The most remarkable feature in the platypus is that although it is a mammal, it lays eggs!Which Mammal lays Eggs? Buck-billed Platypus of AustraliaIn fact, it seems the duck-billed platypus is like a fairy tale creature. Legend has it that when the platypus was first discovered, it was stuffed and sent to England for research. And, at first, the scientists thought it was a joke! They thought someone had glued the bill and feet of a duck onto the body of a beaver!But actually, the platypus and its cousin, the anteater, along with other marsupials like kangaroos, make up the most primitive group of living mammals on earth.The platypus is semi-aquatic as it can stay both in the water and out of it. Its most distinctive feature is its bill, shaped like that of a duck’s. No wonder it is called ‘duck-billed’. The platypus’s head, trunk, and tail are covered with brown fur, which is thick and water proof.Its fur allows it to swim in waters as cold as zero degrees Celsius. It digs a burrow in the ground, where it builds its nest. Its strong shoulder muscles help it dig these burrows.So, that is the platypus’s tale. A bill like a duck’s, a body like a lizard’s and a lifestyle like most mammals. Isn’t that fascinating?*Duck-billed platypus is not the only animal that lays eggs.To be fair duck-billed platypus is not the only animal that lays eggs. There are only five living monotreme species: the duck-billed platypus and four species of echidna (also known as spiny anteaters). ‘Monotreme’ is the technical name for egg-laying mammals.","keyword":"[\"platypus\", \"mammal\", \"bill\", \"duck\", \"monotreme\", \"anteater\"]","ALS":"21.263157894736842"},{"english_id":"730","id":"731","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"Who Invented The Pen?","article":"The history of writing instruments with which humans have recorded and conveyed thoughts, feelings and grocery lists, is the history of civilisation itself. This is how we know about our ancestors and their lives.The handy sharpened-stone, used for skinning and killing animals was adapted into the first writing instrument. Around 24,000 BC, the cave man started drawing pictures with the stone onto the walls of his cave dwelling. His drawings showed events in daily life such as the planting of crops or hunting victories. Walls at the Apollo site in Namibia, southwest Africa are believed to be the oldest rock paintings to date.Before paper came along, people used clay or wax tablets on which they wrote using sharp objects such as metal sticks or bones.Around 6000 years ago, in 4000 BC, the Egyptians invented the first substance like paper called papyrus. It was a woven mat of reeds, pounded together into a hard, thin sheet. The word ‘paper’ actually comes from the word ‘papyrus’. Ancient Greeks are also known to have used a kind of parchment made from animal skins for the same purpose.Who Invented The Pen?Now something was needed to write upon the parchment or the papyrus. Bones or metal sticks were no longer useful as the papyrus could not be scratched. So the Egyptians created a reed-pen perfect for the papyrus. These were mostly the hollow tubular-stems of marsh grasses, especially from the bamboo plant. And thus, ancient Egyptians converted bamboo stems into a primitive form of a fountain pen. They cut one end into the form of a pen nib or point. A writing fluid or ink filled the stem and the reed forced the fluid to the nib.Another writing instrument that remained active in history for a long period was the quill pen. Introduced around 1300 years ago in 700 AD, the quill was a pen made from a bird feather. The five outer left wing feathers were plucked from the birds in the spring season. The left wing was chosen because the feathers curved outward and remained away when used by a right-handed writer. Goose feathers were most common, swan feathers were of a high quality, being scarce and most expensive. For making fine line drawings, crow feathers were the best, then came the feathers of the eagle, owl, hawk and turkey.Quill pens lasted for only a week before it was necessary to replace them. There were other disadvantages associated with their use, including a lengthy preparation time.When writers had better inks and paper and handwriting had developed into both an art form and an everyday occurrence, man’s inventive nature once again turned to improving the writing instrument. This led to the development of the modern fountain pen in the 19th century.","keyword":"[\"papyrus\", \"feather\", \"quill\", \"write\", \"instrument\", \"egyptian\"]","ALS":"24.142857142857142"},{"english_id":"736","id":"737","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"Who invented Hello?","article":"Hello, Hullo, Hallo, Hull-oo-oo-oo.

But Edison didn’t invent ‘hello’ by a long shot. As a matter of fact, the greeting has been around for centuries much before the invention of telephone in 1885.In ancient times, people greeted each other with ‘hallow’, which may have come from the Old French word ‘hola’, meaning ‘stop!’ or ‘whoa’. Even Noah Webster’s dictionary included ‘hello’ in 1883.Who invented Hello?By the time the telephone came along, the Americans were saying ‘hullo’ to each other every day, so it was a short jump to ‘hello’. But it wasn’t until the telephone was invented that ‘hello’ emerged as a universal form of greeting and as a way of establishing contact.So, Edison made hello a popular greeting and an integral part of our lives. Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone in 1885, never liked ‘hello’ and advocated the use of ‘ahoy’ as a telephonic greeting.The telephone links kept expanding, so did the greeting. And soon it became a general greeting. Webster’s dictionary kept printing ‘hello’ as a greeting word even as Alexander Graham Bell rejected the greeting all his life!

And after talking about candles or electric bulbs we invariably choose the _diya_s or earthen lamps for their beautiful flames. But last year, we reached the kumhara or potter’s roadside shop a bit too late. The lamps had been sold out and the potter had a big smile on his face. So we decided to light candles.On Diwali eve we lit up the house with candles, putting one small candle between two large ones, to create a pattern. Horror of horrors, when we looked at them some time later, they had become much smaller. My five-year-old cousin thought it was magic. “Where did the wax disappear?” he asked. I smiled and remembered my uncle Prosanto, who had solved this mystery for me when I was a child.Who stole the Candle Wax?When wax disguises itself“When you wear a disguise, people cannot recognise you. Similarly when candle burns, the wax simply changes into something else.” That’s how my uncle had explained it.That process of burning is called combustion. Combustion is a chemical change which takes place in the presence of oxygen. During combustion one form of matter is changed into another. The burning of wood or coal is also combustion.The candle storyIf you take a close look at the candle you will find that it has a thread running though its centre – this is called the wick. The moment we light the wick the wax starts melting because of the heat. The molten wax rises up through the wick to meet the flame. The molten wax further heats on reaching close to the flame and evaporates to form a gas. The gaseous wax then starts burning, producing heat and light.What is wax made of?The wax of the candle is actually formed of carbon and hydrogen and so is called a hydrocarbon. Most fuels including petrol and coal are hydrocarbons. During the process of burning the carbon combines with the oxygen of the air and forms carbon dioxide. Hydrogen in turn combines with oxygen to form water vapour. In these two reactions wax is consumed and the size of the candle keeps reducing.So now you know what to tell someone who wants to know where the wax disappeared on burning.","keyword":"[\"candle\", \"burning\", \"wick\", \"flame\", \"combustion\", \"hydrocarbon\"]","ALS":"20.857142857142858"},{"english_id":"741","id":"742","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"Who's the Brainiest animal of Them All?","article":"The next time someone calls you an ape or a bird brain, ask her to think again.

How and why a dog senses this subtle shift in its masters health is still a matter of debate.

If you pressed hard on any bent finger, you would have heard a popping sound? Finger joints produce that loud c-r-a-c-king sound. The sound comes when bubbles in the fluid around the joint burst!Our entire body is made of a skeleton of 206 bones. Bones help in giving shape and support to the body and help us move about. Our bones are not too long otherwise we would not be able to bend or grasp things. Bones fit together at joints which is the meeting place between different bones of the skeleton.Joints are divided into fixed and movable ones. Most of the joints in our face are fixed, with the exception of the bones of lower jaw which are flexible and move up and down like a hinge. Joints in our elbows, knees and ankles are flexible and we use them all the time to move around.Bones at these joints are held firm by tissues and ligaments. These are tough cords or straps. Inside each joint is a thin membranous bag that secretes a thick fluid called the synovial fluid. Just like oil lubricates an engine to move slickly, the fluid helps in lubrication and helps the joint move smoothly.When you stretch or bend your finger the bones of the joint are forced apart. As they move apart, the tissues that surround the joint are stretched. This increases the volume of space between the tissues. With an increase in volume the pressure in the synovial fluid drops forming bubbles. When the joint is stretched far enough the pressure drops so low that these bubbles burst, producing a popping sound.It takes half an hour for the gas to dissolve back into the synovial fluid. Once the gas is dissolved it is possible to pop the knuckles again. Lots of people are in the habit of popping knuckles but there is no harm or injury associated with knuckle popping.Scientists however, have seen signs of tissue damage and a decrease in grip strength in certain cases like professional sportspersons. This damage is a result of repeated stretching of the ligaments surrounding the joint.Knuckle popping however, does have its positive effects. An increase in mobility is seen in the joints immediately afterwards. When joints are stretched certain nerve endings are stimulated and the muscles surrounding the joint relax.If you are a first-timer be careful.

Plants are much smarter than what you think they are. They actually use human beings, animals and birds who eat their fruits to propagate their kind. In other words, disperse their seeds.The fruit serves as a mother’s womb where the embryo of a baby plant is nurtured. It protects the embryo, or the seed, in almost the same way as the mother protects her small ones. The flesh of the fruit serves as a protective lining as the seed develops.

But, the sun does not twinkle, one would point out. So why do other stars twinkle?The sun does not twinkle. It blazes down on us. If any of the stars were close to us, they would have also blazed down on us, or even burnt us down.Why Do Stars Twinkle?The stars look different because they are far away. And the light from the stars travels a very long distance to reach us. Actually very little of the light finally manages to reach us. Besides, it passes through the earth’s atmosphere before reaching us. As the light enters the atmosphere, impurities like dust interfere its path. So, sometimes it is visible, and sometimes it is not. This effect is called twinkling.There are certain stars in the night sky that don’t twinkle. Well that’s because they are not stars at all. They are planets. Planets do not twinkle because unlike stars they do not have their own light. They are like the moon. They reflect light from the Sun.So what is a star? A star is born when a cloud of lots of different gases, mainly hydrogen, get together. The gas particles attract each other and slowly get compressed to form a huge mass of gases. And, as this mass grows, the temperature inside grows too. Until such time when it bursts like a bomb. This explosion creates a gas called helium, which is inflammable in nature. The helium becomes its fuel and it continues burning. Thus is a star born.No wonder the heavier stars burn more furiously. They have bigger explosions, where more helium is released, providing more fuel. At the same time, these bigger and brighter stars have a shorter life. Why? Because they use up their fuel more quickly. The life of a smaller and lighter star can be as much as 100 times longer.","keyword":"[\"star\", \"twinkle\", \"helium\", \"fuel\", \"blaze\", \"burn\"]","ALS":"14.32258064516129"},{"english_id":"749","id":"750","level":"4","topic":"10","title":"Why Do We Have Wrinkly Fingers After Swimming?","article":"You’ve been playing in the pool for almost an hour now, practicing your best underwater somersaults.

After spending lots of time in the water, it’s totally normal for fingers (and sometimes toes) to wrinkle.Why Do We Have Wrinkly Fingers After Swimming?Even though you can’t see it, your skin is covered with its own special oil called sebum. Sebum is found on the outermost layer of skin. Sebum lubricates and protects your skin. It also makes your skin a bit waterproof. That’s why getting caught in the rain, hopping in the shower after a game, or washing your hands before dinner won’t leave your skin soggy. Sebum is there to keep the water out.But what happens when you spend a long time in the water? Well, there’s only a particular amount of sebum on your skin at a time. Once the sebum is washed away, the water can make its way into the outer layer of skin. The water does this by osmosis. This is when water actually moves from one thing into another, from a place where there is more water to a place where there is less water. There is more water in the pool than there is in your body, so it naturally moves to the place where there is less water – you!Although your fingers may look shriveled like raisins, they aren’t really shriveled – they’re actually waterlogged! The extra water in your fingers causes the skin to swell in some places but not others, and that’s what causes the wrinkles.It isn’t just pool water that washes away the sebum. Sitting in the bathtub for a long soak can also wash away the sebum and leave a kid with soggy skin. Washing dishes for a long time, scrubbing and rinsing your puppy, cleaning the gravel in your aquarium – anything that keeps your hands in water long enough will give you wrinkly fingers.What should you do if you come out of the pool looking like a raisin? Not a thing! Having wrinkly skin after a swim or bath doesn’t mean there is anything wrong, and it goes away by itself quickly. You’ll have more sebum on your skin in no time.

He was always up to some mischief or the other. As he grew, to his mother’s relief he became a more relaxed child, and over the years his energy level seems to have come down considerably. However, now he feels tired and fatigued. At times he wonders why he gets so tired so soon when there is so much that he wants to do?What is it in our body that causes fatigue? Why do we feel listless and sapped of strength at times? Fatigue is caused by a kind of poisoning produced by our organs. When a muscle in our body works, it produces lactic acid. If we remove the lactic acid from a tired muscle, it is able to start working at once.Why do we get tired?There are other substances the body produces in the course of muscular activity. These are known as fatigue toxins. Blood carries these toxins through the body, so that not only the muscle itself but the entire body and especially the brain, also feels tired.Scientists have conducted interesting experiments on fatigue. If a dog is made to work until it is exhausted and falls asleep, and its blood is then transfused into another dog, the second dog will instantly become tired and also feel sleepy. Similarly if the blood of a wide-awake dog is transfused into a tired, sleeping dog, the latter will wake up at once and no longer feel tired.But fatigue is not just a chemical process; it is also a biological process. We cannot just ‘remove’ fatigue; we must also allow the cells of the body to rest. Damages must be repaired, nerve cells of the brain must be ‘recharged’, and the muscles need to relax and unwind.Very often, the best way to make a tired body part feel fresh again is to make other parts of the body active. We can actually rest by means of activity. Activity increases the respiration. The blood circulates faster, the glands are more active, and the waste products are eliminated from the tired parts of the body.But, if you are totally exhausted the best thing to do is sleep. Sleep is a great vitaliser and relaxes the muscles and stops the production of the lactic acid. Sleep is thus very important and can thus, restore our body’s energy after a period of hard work. The best way to energise and refresh our tired muscles and body is to make it a point to sleep for at least eight hours every day.","keyword":"[\"tired\", \"fatigue\", \"muscle\", \"lactic\", \"sleep\", \"feel\"]","ALS":"22.761904761904763"},{"english_id":"755","id":"756","level":"4","topic":"10","title":"Why are Moths Attracted to Light?","article":"Have you seen moths zoom into a flame and die?

I could never get the right answer to satisfy my curiosity. I now realize why my parents could not give me a concrete answer. You see I happened to be in the same dilemma when my three-year-old daughter asked me the same question! I was faced with the difficult task of giving her half-baked answers or finding the right answers this time.The most obvious question to ask about zebras is why are zebras striped? Unfortunately nobody really knows the answer. Looking at zebras in the zoo, the striped pattern seems very conspicuous and could hardly be thought of as protective.Zoologists believe the stripes on a zebra could be one of several reasons. It could be basically for camouflage very much like the military fatigues. The bold wavy lines of a zebra blend in with the tall wavy grassy plains of Africa where these animals live. The bold stripe may even serve to break up the shape of the Zebra. If a zebra is standing still in such surroundings, a lion, its chief predator, may overlook it completely.Why are Zebras Striped?It doesn’t matter that the zebra’s stripes are black and white and the grass are dusty brown or green, because the lion is colour blind!However this may benefit an individual zebra in some situations but is it likely a large zebra herd would be able to escape a lion’s notice? This is exactly where it helps the zebra most. Zebra herds are very large but they stay very close to one another.When all the zebras stick together in a herd, the pattern of stripes blends in with the stripes of the zebras around it. This is confusing to the lion! All it can see is a large, moving, striped mass instead of many individual zebras. The lion has trouble picking out individual zebras and it’s harder still for the lion to recognize which way each zebra is moving!Each zebra pattern is unique like a fingerprint. Also like a fingerprint, the patter varies from zebra to zebra and no two zebras are exactly alike. What is truly amazing is that zebras can recognize other zebras from their body stripe! A mother can instantly spot her colt in a herd!There are three species classified according to the variations in the arrangement of the stripes – the Imperial or Grevy’s zebra, the Plains or Common zebra and the Mountain zebra – and several subspecies. The mountain zebra is the smallest of these averaging only four feet. It has silver-white stripes with black markings that extend to every part of the body except the stomach and the inner part of thighs. Plains zebras travel in large herds and are pale yellow with broad black stripes. This specie has several variations: some have stripes down to the hooves while the lower legs of the others are solid white without any stripes.Do you know that people of Africa think of zebras as black animals with white stripes whereas people outside Africa consider them as white animals with black stripes! Black stripes or white, the fact remains that zebras are extremely unique and are among the fastest and most graceful of runners in the African bush land.","keyword":"[\"zebra\", \"stripe\", \"herd\", \"answer\", \"strip\", \"black\"]","ALS":"24.115384615384617"},{"english_id":"759","id":"760","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"Why can’t the Sun melt Snow?","article":"There are some things in nature that have a great capacity to toss back or reflect a great deal of the sun’s light that falls on them. One of them is snow. Newly formed snow reflects about 90 per cent of the sunlight that falls upon it. This means that the sun is powerless to melt clean snow. And when snow does melt, it is not because of the sunlight. Snow does not melt on a spring day because of the sun’s heat. It melts because of the warm air from the sea.After snow becomes ice, a different problem arises. Clean ice absorbs about two-thirds of the sunlight that hits it – but ice is transparent enough for the light to penetrate quite a long way (10 metres or more) before the absorption takes place.Why can’t the Sun melt Snow?It is remarkable what profound results follow from this simple property of transparency to sunlight. If, instead of penetrating deeply, the light were absorbed in a shallow surface layer of ice, the summer sun would quickly raise the temperature of the thin surface layer to melting point. And almost immediately, the water would run off.But when the sunlight penetrates a thick layer of ice before it can be absorbed, it cannot raise the temperature of the ice to melting point quickly enough. When the ice is very cold, the whole summer passes before any melting occurs at all. This is what happens today in the Antarctic, just as it must have happened in northern Europe during an Ice Age.Just imagine, if by magic, ice were suddenly made opaque to light, the glaciers that exist today would melt away in a few years, raising the sea level by 60 metres or more. It would flood at least half the world’s population.Simply amazing how so much depends on so simple a physical property!Clouds toss back about 50 per cent of the light that hits them. Ice and deserts reflect 35 per cent. Land areas are generally a good deal lower in reflectivity – usually 10 to 20 per cent, depending on the nature of vegetation.Oceans, which cover 71 per cent of the Earth’s surface, are least reflective of all – only about three per cent. That is why oceans appear dark in pictures of the Earth taken from the Moon or from artificial satellites.When all the sources of reflection are added together, our planet is found to turn back into space some 36 per cent of the solar radiation falling upon it.From the Woodpecker volume 2000, brought out by the Academy of Mountain Environics, an NGO based in Dehra Dun, in north India.

The black box does not play any part in making an aircraft fly but it serves an important function. It is basically an electronic device used by investigators to discover the cause of a crash and may be, prevent others.The black box can be inserted or removed from an aircraft. In a passenger aircraft there are actually two black boxes. One contains the flight data-recorder and the other, the cockpit-voice recorder.The flight data-recorder registers the aircraft’s speed, direction, altitude and other important information throughout the flight. The cockpit-voice recorder has a small cassette tape in it. This tape runs continuously like that in an answering machine. It has an endless loop of tape, which keeps recording each and every message. However, depending upon the capacity of the tape, one can retrieve messages in the previous 30 or 60 minutes.Illustration of a flight recorder (black box) in customary bright orangeBoth the recorders are placed in the cockpit of the plane.In order to protect the recorders, they are kept separately.

The flight was scheduled for six a.m. As the aeroplane taxied on the runway it gained speed. I felt a kick in the stomach and then we were airborne. It was my first flight and I was very excited. My father who was sitting next to me, asked, “Can you tell me how the aircraft flies?”“Because of wings,” I replied promptly. But I could not tell him what the wings do to make a plane fly.A simple phenomenon – a grand explanationFather took a sheet of paper and held it by two parallel ends. The paper drooped from the other side due to its weight. Next, Father blew hard across the top of the paper. Amazingly, the drooping side of the paper suddenly straightened up and seemed to be floating in air. “This is exactly what happens with an aeroplane too,” he said.Why do Airplanes have Wings?“But no one’s blowing air on the aeroplane!” I said. The explanation followed – the aeroplane’s engines push it along the runway at a great speed. It is only when the wind starts rushing past its wings that the plane flies.Aerodynamics and wing designAn aeroplane’s wing is flat at the bottom and curved at the top. As the wing cuts through the air, the wind either flows along the top or the bottom of the wing.However, in going over the top of the wing the wind has to travel a longer distance because of the curve. Hence, it also has to travel faster. This creates a low air pressure on the top of the wings.As the plane gathers speed, this air pressure keeps decreasing. Meanwhile, the higher pressure underneath the wing helps to push it up. That’s how the aircraft gets the required push to rise in the air, just the way it made the paper straighten.Actually, all flying creatures and flying objects follow the same principle for sailing through the air. The next time I saw an aeroplane in flight, I gave my father a nodding smile, for I knew what flying was all about.","keyword":"[\"aeroplane\", \"paper\", \"plane\", \"runway\", \"father\", \"flight\"]","ALS":"22.333333333333332"},{"english_id":"763","id":"764","level":"4","topic":"14","title":"Why do Beavers Build Dams?","article":"Picture a giant rat with a flat tail and webbed feet. That’s what the beaver looks like.There are two kinds of beavers: the American and the European. The European beaver, found in Norway, Poland, Germany and France, lives in burrows.But the American beaver builds a dam across a stream or lake to construct his home or lodge. The lodges are made of huge logs of trees.The American beaver constructs solid dams and lodges because it has the mind of an expert engineer among all the creatures in the animal kingdom. And it is hard-working too. Moreover, building fortress like lodges and dams helps it escape unfriendly animals.It is a fascinating process. The beaver first chooses a site towards the narrow end of a stream. Then it starts to fell trees. The animal stands on its hind legs and gnaws at the tree trunk with its sharp chisel-like teeth. The branches are cut off and the tree is then dragged or floated to the chosen site to dam the water. The tree acts like a wall.The beaver uses broken branches, stones and mud to make the dam watertight. On this structure it builds a large dome-shaped lodge with two underwater entrances. One is a general entrance while the other entrance helps the beaver escape the animals that could harm it.The beaver uses the lodge to store food as well as to raise its young. Since lakes and rivers freeze in winter, the lodge becomes a refuge from preying animals. Due to its underwater entrances the beaver can come and go as it pleases under the ice. Beaver dams also act as channels to control the flow of water in a stream or lake.And that’s how the term eager beaver came about.","keyword":"[\"beaver\", \"lodge\", \"entrance\", \"stream\", \"build\", \"tree\"]","ALS":"19.875"},{"english_id":"764","id":"765","level":"4","topic":"1","title":"Why do Cats Always Land on Their Feet?","article":"When someone falls from the fourth or fifth floor, and survives, we call it a miracle. When a cat falls from that height, we watch astonished as it lands on all fours, pauses, then straighten up and walks away looking just a little fazed. What would you call this, a miracle or God’s grace?Any guesses why cats survive while humans don’t? Well, it all has to do with the in-built ability of a cat to adjust its position during a sudden fall, its light weight and lithe muscular body. While humans tumble uncontrollably and completely lose control over their bodies when they fall, cats are able to straighten themselves even in mid-air and manage to fall on their feet.Why do Cats Always Land on Their Feet?A cat called Sabrina fell from the top of a 32-storeyed building and walked away with only a chipped tooth and a collapsed lung! For long, humans have not been able to comprehend a cat’s ability to fall gracefully, till a cat falling from a great height was photographed by a high-speed camera.This is what the camera filmed: when a cat falls from a great height, on its way down, it extends all four legs sideways as if it is gliding. This exposes a greater surface area to the air below, almost like a tiny parachute.And because cats are so light, at one point, the speed with which they fall is almost equal to the upward thrust of air and the two get balanced. As a result, the cat continues to fall but at a steady speed, unlike humans who hurtle down with an increasing speed to crash on the ground. This gives the cat a bearing over the situation and it spreads its limbs out like a parachute.Unlike humans, cats do not tumble because of an exceptional sensory system. It immediately tells the cat’s nervous system that it is upside down and falling. Thanks to this, the agile cat twists its body at once for a safer landing. Even its feet are flexed in order to absorb the shock of the fall.And the cat’s muscles that join and surround its bones make the best shock absorbers ever made!In fact, the cat’s agility, alertness and swift reaction to emergencies has given it the reputation of surviving no matter what happens.","keyword":"[\"fall\", \"tumble\", \"height\", \"miracle\", \"straighten\", \"speed\"]","ALS":"36.5"},{"english_id":"765","id":"766","level":"4","topic":"9","title":"Why do Clocks Run Clockwise?","article":"“Time to get dressed!” cries a harried Mama as she tries to pack the bag, straighten the tie, pack lunch, tie shoelaces as at the same time she pushes children dragging their heels towards the bus stop.

Most of us spend a greater part of our time and lives trying to beat exactly this – time!Strangely enough the clock’s needles seem to take forever to inch forward during a dull lesson, while time really flies when we are having a good time!All of us are time conscious. We surround ourselves with alarm clocks, cuckoo clocks, wristwatches, grandfather clocks and peering at them to make sure we are sticking to our schedule. But have you ever taken a moment to wonder why the needles on the face of a clock move the way they do? Why do the hour and minute needles move from left to right (in what is now called the ‘clockwise direction’) and not vice-versa? No, it is not the whim of the inventor actually there is a scientific explanation for this observation.Why do Clocks Run Clockwise?Throughout history, time has been measured by the movement of the Sun (or, more accurately, the motion of the Earth relative to the Sun). The earliest form of timekeeping dates as far back as 3500 B.C. This was the shadow clock or the sundials – a vertical stick or obelisk (A tall, four-sided shaft of stone, usually tapered and monolithic, that rises to a point) that casts a shadow. An example of this clock can be seen at Jantar Mantar in Delhi.People had already realised that the earth is round and that it revolves around the sun. So for ages people measured time based on the position of the sun – it was noon when the sun was highest in the sky.The earliest clocks were invented in China around 100 A.D. based on these earlier sundials, which were simple devices that marked the movement of the sun with the movement of the earth.Prague Astronomical Clock: A medieval astronomical clock, on the southern wall of Old Town City Hall in the Old Town Square, Prague, Czech Republic.Mechanical clocks were invented in the Northern Hemisphere in the 14th century and the inventors naturally wanted the device to follow the sun’s movement in the sky. In the Northern Hemisphere the Sun appears to move in the sky from the left to the right and so the hands of the clock were made to follow the Sun’s motion, moving from left to right or what is commonly known as clockwise. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere and face the South, you can watch the Sun rising on your left (the East) pass overhead and set in the West (at your right).As simple as that! Come to think of it, if the mechanical clock had been invented in the Southern Hemisphere, the hand on the dial of your watch would have been moving from right to left!Do you know there are some Jewish and Arabic clocks that run anti-clockwise? This makes perfect sense as Arabic and Hebrew readers (Arabic and Hebrew characters are written right to left) but baffles everyone else!The clock at the bottom with the Hebrew numbers runs counterclockwise.

Da-dub, da-dub, da-dub. Very reassuring, these gentle thuds, that remind us that our bodies are kicking along, and that, at least at last touch, we’re alive and well.By pulse we mean the regular throbbing of arteries caused by the successive contractions of the heart. During the action of the heart there is a pause. During this pause, the wall of the aorta contracts. The aorta is the great trunk artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.This contraction forces the excess blood to proceed along the arteries. This alternate expansion and contraction of the aorta produces a throbbing in the arteries. And this throbbing – which can be felt at many points in the body – through the skin, is called pulse.Why do doctors examine the pulse?The pulse can be felt by placing fingers on the inside of the wrist over the radical artery. It can also be felt at the temples where we have the temporal artery or at other places where an artery is near the surface of the skin.The pulse cannot be felt in the veins because the blood reaches them from the arteries by passing through narrow capillaries.Now the question arises. Why does a nurse or doctor examine the pulse of a patient?When a doctor checks the pulse, beats are counted for a minute. Since the rate of contractions felt at the wrist would be same as the heart rate, the pulse tells us about the health of the heart.The pulse rate depends on the blood requirement of the body. This rate indicates how fast the heart is beating and the state of pressure in the circulatory system. An irregular pulse rate indicates some abnormality in the functioning of the heart.The number of pulsations per minute normally varies from 78 to 82 among women and from 70 to 72 among men. Abnormalities in the pulse rate often indicate specific disorders of the heart and circulatory system.The pulse rate in children is much higher than in healthy adults. The normal rate for a seven-year-old child is 90 beats per minute. A newborn baby’s pulse rate is double that of an adult male, about 140. At the other end, elderly people can have a pulse rate as slow as 50-65.","keyword":"[\"pulse\", \"artery\", \"rate\", \"throbbing\", \"contraction\", \"heart\"]","ALS":"25.88235294117647"},{"english_id":"770","id":"771","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"Why do Flies have Compound Eyes?","article":"Just like a man woos the woman he loves, takes her to nice restaurants, buys her presents, and courts her to impress her before marriage, animals too choose their mates through courtship.Since animals cannot do all these, they do it differently. Some animals put up a colourful display, while others give little gifts to their beloved – a choice worm, a designer nest and so on. A few species display their love through a series of grunts and others, like the Saurus crane or the stickleback fish, perform an intricate courtship dance.Bowerbirds of New Guinea and Australia, create a small tower with twigs, shells, and flowers to attract the female and the tailorbird builds an intricate cocooned nest. Looking at nature’s numerous examples, one thing is quite obvious – impressing the other sex is quite a challenge.Scientists have been studying the mating habits of animals and insects for years. Very few species can claim to have it easy. However, a recent study shows that the male houseflies have always had an eye out for the female of the species.The eye of the fly is quite complex. Flies eyes’ are compound in nature – they contain as many as 28,000 light-sensitive structures called ommatidia (pronounced: om-ha-tee-dee-ya) grouped under the cornea.The cornea in turn is composed of an equal number of hexagonal prism-shaped structures, each forming a separate image. The final image thus formed is actually like a mosaic image.A macro portrait of the compound eye of a fly: Why do flies have compound eyes?Compound eyes are only found in invertebrates (animals lacking a backbone). Entomologists (scientists who study insects) point out that compound eyes are adapted to spot swiftly moving objects, whereas simple eyes (the kind you and I have) are better adapted to see nearby objects and detect changes in light intensity.The study reveals that specific region in the male fly’s eye helps them keep track of fast moving objects – a mechanism which they use to track female flies.Unlike female flies, which generally glide along minding their own business, male flies are constantly on the look out for a partner. American scientists have named this specific region of the male fly’s eye, ‘the love spot’. They say that this region is enlarged to process incoming visual signals 60 per cent faster than females.Since the cells of the ‘the love spot’ work much faster than those of female flies, male flies have an edge in zeroing in on potential mates.However, whenever there is a good thing going there is a small catch, and for the male flies too the catch is that this specialised region in the eye consumes a lot of ‘metabolic’ energy.Scientists theorise that since the male flies are not involved in laying eggs, the excess energy saved is put to use into other activities. Whereas in the case of female flies, they need to save up their energy to lay eggs.The fly family can be divided into two major suborders – one consists of slender insects with long antennae, such as the mosquito and gnat, while the members of the other order, like the housefly, have stouter bodies and short antennae.Flies make up one of the largest insect order for they contain about 80,000 known species and are found throughout the world, including Antarctica.","keyword":"[\"compound\", \"male\", \"female\", \"love\", \"region\", \"impress\"]","ALS":"51.166666666666664"},{"english_id":"771","id":"772","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"Why do Humans Sweat?","article":"It is an annual ritual in most Indian homes. With the onset of summer it is time to bring the rusty, rickety old coolers down from the terrace and get them repaired. The reason is obvious – it is difficult to live through the hot, sweaty Indian summer without an air cooler. But did you know that the human body has its own cooler as well?Think of the times you have travelled in a car. How hot the vehicle engine gets after a long journey. Similarly, as our bodies chug along they produce heat in the process.They normally maintain a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degree Celsius) and become feverish if it rises above this point.Unlike a car engine, however, our bodies have a system to check “overheating”. This is done with the help of sweat, which serves as a coolant.Why do Humans Sweat?How does sweat cool?Try this out. Put a small drop of water on the back of your hand. Then place your mouth close to your hand and blow hard. That spot will gradually feel cool. This is because the water begins to evaporate with your blowing and produces a cooling sensation.The inbuilt cooling system of the body uses the skin and blood for its functioning. The blood warms up as it passes through muscles and tissue. It carries the extra heat to the surface of the skin, which triggers the sweat glands in the skin to produce sweat – a combination of water (usually about 99 per cent) with small amounts of salts and amino acids dissolved in it.The sweat escapes through tiny pores on the skin, evaporating as it reaches the surface. As the sweat evaporates, it cools the skin beneath.In fact, a pearl-sized bead of sweat can cool nearly one litre of blood by 1.8 degree Centigrade (one degree Fahrenheit).Why do we sweat more in summer?Have you ever wondered why you sweat more on hot summer afternoons? Actually, the human body sweats all the time, even when we are sleeping.But when we exercise or perform some strenuous work we sweat more as the body gets heated up faster. As a result, we sweat more during summers and less during winters. The rate of sweating is directly related to our body temperature.Remember, the more you sweat the more you lose water. So, the next time you go out in the sun, make sure you drink enough water because, like the room cooler, the system under your skin needs water to function.","keyword":"[\"sweat\", \"cool\", \"cooler\", \"summer\", \"evaporate\", \"degree\"]","ALS":"26.055555555555557"},{"english_id":"773","id":"774","level":"4","topic":"16","title":"Why do Meteorites Strike the Earth?","article":"On a hot summer afternoon, I sat down with my elder brother to play carom.

Quite like the way the striker hit the coins.”I was amused. “How is it possible? The earth is so huge. Anyway there aren’t any strikers flying around in the solar system?”First lessons about the solar systemThen dada explained. Apart from the sun and the nine planets in our solar system, there are a huge number of small rocks and smaller heavenly objects, which circle the sun. Sometimes, these rocks leave their paths and head straight for the earth, attracted by the earth’s gravitational pull.These heavenly bodies that fall to the earth are called meteorites. Usually, the earth is bombarded by several thousand of them each day. And sometimes they can be huge – as huge as a football field.One of the world’s best preserved meteorite impact site is in Northern Arizona, USA. Today, Meteor Crater is nearly one mile across, 2.4 miles in circumference and more than 550 feet deep. Scientists estimate that this crater was caused some 50,000 years ago when a piece of an nickel-iron meteorite traveling at 26,000 miles per hour hit planet EarthThe meteorite and the dinosaurImagine a rock the size of your school hitting the earth. In the 1980s, a crater with a 110-mile diameter was discovered in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Traced to a huge meteorite hit on the earth, it was dated back to 65 million years ago – roughly around the time the dinosaurs became extinct.This led to a theory in the scientist community that dinosaurs became extinct because of the large-scale environmental changes brought about by the enormous impact of the meteor hit. A 110-mile meteorite hitting the earth would be greater than exploding a thousand hydrogen bombs together, and would virtually wipe out every living species from earth’s face.While it is possible to roughly predict the timing of a meteorite hit for scientists who are constantly peering at outer space, they would find it difficult to point at the exact location of the hit.

I remember watching my mother work in the kitchen. She was cutting onions for the salad and I could see tears in her eyes. For a child the worst possible thing is to watch his\/her mother cry. I got so upset that I got hysterical at my father for causing her pain. For I assumed my father was somehow responsible as we were only the three of us in our family.Later they explained it to me that it was the onion that was at fault and not my father as I thought. In fact many of us still do not know why onions make us cry – people take it as part of their lives and accept it stoically.Why do Onions Make us Cry?To begin with did you know that you ‘cry’ all day long? Every time you blink your eye there is a fine layer of water in your eyes. You see, there is a tear gland that is situated over the outer corner of each eye. Every time your eyelid closes, it creates a suction, which takes out some fluid from the tear gland. This fluid we call ‘tears’.Normally this fluid has only one purpose. This is to cleanse the cornea, the white portion of the eye, and so prevent it from drying out. But suppose some irritating substance reaches the eye? The eye automatically blinks and tears instantly appear to wash the irritant out of the eye and protect the eye against the irritant.We are all familiar with the experience of having smoke get into our eyes. It makes us cry. Well the onion sends out an irritating substance too. The onion has an oil containing sulphur, which gives it its sharp tangy odour. This same substance also irritates the eye. The eye reacts by blinking and by producing tears to wash away the irritant! It is as simple as that.The onion is an interesting vegetable. It is a member of the lily family, and it is a native of Asia. Onions belong to the genus Alliums and are therefore related to the milder Leek and the very pungent Garlic, both of which are cultivated extensively in Europe. The mildest and the biggest onion is the Spanish onion, which often weighs 450 grams or more.Man has used the onion as food for thousands of years.

In woodlands where there is a thick canopy of trees and sunlight rarely falls on earth, very few plants survive. Those that do, do not require sunlight to make their food.People have long wondered about this phenomenon until the answer was discovered and explained by the English naturalist Charles Darwin. He demonstrated that the growing shoot of a grass seedling always bends towards light. This is due to a phenomenon called phototropism.Why do Plants Lean Toward Sunlight? We know that green plants make their food by the process of photosynthesis. The leaves of the green plants contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll converts water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air into oxygen and sugar.Oxygen is then released into the air and sugar is taken as food by the plant. But this entire process of making food can only be done in the presence of sunlight. The leaves, therefore, lean towards the light for photosynthesis. Without sunlight green plants cannot survive.How does a rigid plant bend or grow to one side? Plant cells contain a substance called aurins. This substance has a tendency to move away from the light. Aurins make the cells on the darker side grow faster than the cells on the lighted side.Why does the Sun follow You?This causes the stems and the leaves to bend or lean towards the lighted side. The concentration of aurins on the dark side may be due to the fact that sunlight slows or kills these aurins when light falls on them. However, as long as one part of the plant gets sunlight, it can make food and the whole plant survives.Try this experiment at home or in school. Take a potted plant and put it near a window where there is sunlight. Take another potted plant and keep it in the darkest corner of the room. After a week or 10 days, you will notice that the plant near the window is healthy while that in the dark corner is not.","keyword":"[\"plant\", \"sunlight\", \"aurins\", \"bend\", \"lean\", \"window\"]","ALS":"19.789473684210527"},{"english_id":"777","id":"778","level":"4","topic":"19","title":"Why do Some People Stutter?","article":"Rahul is a lonely child. He is laughed at because whenever he speaks, he stutters. He goes “my name is Ra-Ra-Rahul.” His mother and grandmother thought it was because he had a short tongue. Other people said it was because, as a baby, Rahul’s hair was cut before he spoke his first word. Finally, Rahul’s mother took him to the doctor. She was told that it had nothing to do with these myths. Rather, Rahul had a speech disorder called dysphemia.When we speak, a complex system of muscles coordinates the tongue, larynx (voice box), lips and mouth to produce sound. Sometimes a spasm occurs in these muscles and the speaker gets stuck with the first sound of the word. So instead of saying ‘Rahul’ the person would say ‘Ra-Ra-Rahul’.Very many myths surround this disorder. People think stuttering is caused by forcing a left-handed child to be right-handed or tickling the child too much and so on. Stuttering or stammering is a speech disorder, the cause of which is still unknown.It would be mere speculation to suggest it may have something to do with physical disorder or emotional disturbance. It can, though, be hereditary and is found to occur in children in the age group of six or seven years. It afflicts boys more than girls.Can stuttering be controlled?It is generally accepted that if you have a speech disorder, you should learn to accept the situation and overcome the fear. By accepting the worst you feel confident enough to relax and be spontaneous.Stuttering is difficult to treat and demands skill and a sense of responsibility on the part of the therapist. It can be corrected through psychotherapy or speech therapy. Those afflicted are taught to read and speak slowly, distinctly and to breathe regularly while speaking.Parental counselling can sometimes help prevent stuttering. Parents can ensure that their children do not develop habits of hesitation or syllable repetition while speaking.People who stutter must remember that it is not their fault. Also, they do not stutter all the time. When they are singing, whispering, speaking in chorus or when they are alone or being totally spontaneous, they are perfect.There are days when one does not stutter at all while other days can be sheer misery. When trying to impress someone, do not try to hide the fact that you stutter and make a mess of it. Instead, make people pay attention to what you are saying, not how you are saying it.In the end, remember, stuttering is a disorder that interferes with the flow of speech. But you are not alone. Nearly everyone suffers from this problem to some extent. However, the differentiating factor is the frequency and severity of behaviour and loss of control. It is this loss of control, which can’t be experienced by the listener and causes the greatest problem.","keyword":"[\"stutter\", \"disorder\", \"rahul\", \"speech\", \"speak\", \"accept\"]","ALS":"21.44"},{"english_id":"778","id":"779","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"Why do Some People snore More than Others?","article":"If you ever slept in a room with an uncle or an aunt who snores, you would know how annoying it can be. The person causing all the noise sleeps like a log, while the room partner spends the night tossing and turning; waking up bleary-eyed the next morning.Did you know that snoring is a common ailment all over the world? Believe it or not, but on an average one in every four adults snores, says the website sleepquest.com, a site listed by Britannica.Why do people snore? Why doesn’t a little baby snore? Well, snoring is caused by the flapping of soft tissue in the throat. When we sleep, the muscles in our bodies relax and the soft tissues become slack.Why do Some People snore More than Others? An image of a snoring husband.The wind pipe and snoringWhen we breathe, the air passes through the wind pipe on its way to the lungs. At the same time, the muscles around the wind pipe contract making the wind pipe narrow. Since, the wind pipe is narrow, the air passing through it is under a greater pressure.Normally, while we are awake, this is not a problem. However while we sleep, the soft flabby tissues in our throat is slack. The gush of high pressured air causes these flabby tissues to vibrate producing a rattling snore.It is really very difficult to cure snoring. There are several flabby tissues in the airway, mouth and throat and finding out which is the errant flapper is quite difficult.And the older a person gets, the looser the tissues in the throat and mouth become. This explains why elderly people snore more than young children.British researchers are trying to develop a ‘snore meter’ that aims to identify which tissue is vibrating and causing the problem. Most scientists are of the belief that a snore is a mixture of different sounds, created by different tissues flapping around.For instance, sometimes the flabby tissue of the throat and the mucous lining in the nose region vibrate together to produce an ear-splitting snore. Once the loudest flapper of the lot is identified, high-tech laser surgery would be used to harden the tissue so that it doesn’t flap anymore.","keyword":"[\"snore\", \"tissue\", \"flabby\", \"pipe\", \"throat\", \"wind\"]","ALS":"27.133333333333333"},{"english_id":"779","id":"780","level":"4","topic":"15","title":"Why do We Cup Our Hands When We Shout?","article":"“Go on Sanjay, go on,” we shouted. It was the annual sports meet in our school and the 100 metres sprint was on. The White House runner Deepak was giving our Blue House sprinter, Sanjay, tough competition.As the sprinters neared the finishing line, and the shouts turned into screams, I noticed something remarkable. Everyone had cupped their hands around their mouths while shouting.The gesture caught my attention. I had seen that kind of a hand movement in plays and folk dances. What is the reason behind this theatrical gesture?Why do We Cup Our Hands When We Shout?The science behind soundIt has something to do with sound waves and the way we hear. The vibrations of vocal chords in the throat produce sound waves, which come out through our mouth and travel through the air in all directions. The vocal chords are tiny strings, which hang from our voice box or larynx. The sound, which we produce, spreads out in all directions like ripples in a pond.When these waves strike a person’s ear, she or he is able to hear our sound. When the waves spread out in all directions, a person standing at a distance is not able to hear it with intensity, for the energy of the sound waves is also spread out.But, when we cup our hands around our mouth, the sound waves travel only in one direction. The intensity of the sound waves does not decrease. Thus, the sound can travel much further and clearly reach a person standing at a distance. Cupping your hands around your mouth is a simple method of making your voice reach farther.As for the sports meet, White House defeated Blue House and bagged the sports trophy.

Weird, who knows! Well, mostly people blink around 15 times a minute (Reader’s Digest – Why in the World).Blinking is an involuntary action that protects the eye. Most of our eye is enclosed in a bony socket covered with a layer of fat, which forms a protective cover. But when the eyes are open, one-tenth of the total surface area is exposed to the atmosphere. This means the eye, the most delicate and sensitive part of the body, has to withstand the dust present in the air.So, what do the eyes do as a safeguard mechanism? They blink. Blinking helps in two ways. It lubricates the eyes and keeps the front portion clear for good vision. When we blink, a film of tears covers the eyes and washes all the minute dust particles that may be present.That is the physiological reason behind blinking but we blink for psychological reasons as well. For instance, nervousness, loud noises, stress and tension affect the number of times we blink. You can even try it out yourself. Count the number of times you blink when you do something wrong. The tension would probably make you blink more.But a driver using all his concentration powers, to manoeuvre his way through a crowded street, will probably blink less. The effort to concentrate on the task ahead will make him blink a fewer number of times.Observe people around to see who blinks how many times in what surroundings. It sure can be fun.","keyword":"[\"blink\", \"tension\", \"minute\", \"dust\", \"cover\", \"involuntary\"]","ALS":"18.0625"},{"english_id":"783","id":"784","level":"4","topic":"15","title":"Why do we Get Hiccups?","article":"Hic! You’ve just hiccuped for what seems like the tenth time since you finished your big dinner. Wonder where these funny noises are coming from? The part to blame is your diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle at the bottom of your chest, and all hiccups start here.The diaphragm almost always works perfectly. It pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs.But sometimes the diaphragm becomes irritated, and when this happens, it pushes up in a jerky way that makes your breath come out differently from how it normally does. When this irregular breath hits your voice box, you’re left with a big hiccup.Some things that irritate the diaphragm are eating too quickly or too much, an irritation in the stomach or the throat, or feeling nervous or excited. Almost all cases of the hiccups last only a few minutes. Some cases of the hiccups can last for days or weeks, but this is very unusual, and it’s usually a sign of another medical problem.You’ve probably heard lots of suggestions for how to get rid of hiccups, and maybe you’ve even tried a few. Breathing into a paper bag is one way some people can get rid of their hiccups, other people say that drinking from the wrong side of a glass of water is the way to become hiccup-free.

Well, if you do, then you cannot possibly be further from the truth. Until recently many researchers used to think yawning is essential to increasing the oxygen intake to the lungs. A few on the other hand insisted that yawning is similar to stretching as it increases blood pressure and heart beat rate.While both research findings are correct, new studies show that yawning actually perks you up instead of doing the opposite (as many of us seem to think). Scientists point out that we have a tendency to yawn before a big event – athletes yawn before a race, pilots yawn before take-off and you yawn before an exam.Humans are not the only ones affected by the yawning bug. Animals have been observed to yawn before feeding time while wild animals have a tendency to yawn before a fight.Why do we Yawn?The act is also highly contagious so if you spot someone with his mouth open, chances are, you too will follow suit. New findings highlight something totally unthinkable – yawning might be a primitive handover from our ancestors signalling a need for change. Or in other words, the act essentially prepares the brain for change.Believe it or not but even a baby in the womb yawns as it shifts position, however children do not begin to copy other people’s yawns until the age of four or five. Studies show that this period of growth is crucial to the learning process as the child improves his\/her social skills.Strangely enough contagious yawning is also linked to intelligence in children (who show the first signs of contagious yawning) surpassing other slow learners.Hundreds and thousands of years ago, the campfire served as the main gathering point for all the members of the group. Researchers claim that as the people sat around the fire, warming themselves, they would yawn if the leader yawned, as a mark of respect. Those who were more supportive of the leader were more inclined to yawn.Come to think of it, there might be some truth in it. Have you ever noticed yawning is more contagious if the yawner is someone you like or who you are close to?? It’s true and there is ample documentation of the fact.Despite all these advancements scientists still haven’t figured out why we yawn before bed-time, but then again, that is our way of demanding a change -enough of TV, its time to go to bed!","keyword":"[\"yawn\", \"yawning\", \"contagious\", \"finding\", \"tendency\", \"truth\"]","ALS":"35.23076923076923"},{"english_id":"786","id":"787","level":"4","topic":"5","title":"Why does Cola Fizz?","article":"Switch on the television and you are bound to see some cola advertisements. Aamir Khan, a Bollywood hero, pops open a cola and the bubbly drink fizzes to the top. Have you ever wondered what causes the countless teeny bubbles in all these soft drinks?Soft drinks are carbonated, i.e. carbon dioxide gas is dissolved in the liquid. This gas gives the drink its sparkle and tangy taste, and prevents it from spoiling (the gas reduces bacterial growth).Carbon dioxide gas dissolves in a liquid solution only under high pressure. When a cola bottle is popped open, pressure is released and the carbon dioxide gas rises up. It forms countless tiny bubbles that pop and create a fizzing sound.Why does Cola Fizz?If you shake a bottle of cola before opening it, what happens?The shaking causes some of the gas to come out of the cola solution. As the lid is not yet opened, the gas gets compressed in the tiny space – above the cola and below the lid. This causes a pressure to build up. When the cap is opened, the drink sprays out on you and creates a mess.Two parts of oxygen and one of carbon: CO2Carbon dioxide is a colourless, odourless gas that does not burn. One molecule of the gas consists of one atom of carbon, joined to two atoms of oxygen (CO2). Dissolving carbon dioxide gas in a solution is known as carbonation.Carbonation takes place by chilling the liquid and letting it flow over a series of plates in an enclosure that contains carbon dioxide under pressure. The lower the temperature and the higher the pressure, the greater the amount of gas that dissolves in the drink. Besides causing the fizz in soft drinks, carbon dioxide is also used to put out fires. Solid carbon dioxide (known as dry ice), is widely used to refrigerate things, as its cooling effect is almost twice that of water ice.","keyword":"[\"cola\", \"dioxide\", \"carbon\", \"drink\", \"fizz\", \"dissolve\"]","ALS":"24.2"},{"english_id":"789","id":"790","level":"4","topic":"13","title":"Why does a Cricket Ball Swing?","article":"How many times have all of us heard that the former captain of the Indian cricket team, Kapil Dev, was one of the greatest out-swing bowlers of all times. Indeed! He took more than 430 wickets in Test cricket. But, do you know how a cricket ball swings?The term ‘swing’ refers to the movement of the cricket ball in the air after it leaves the bowler’s hand, which takes the ball away from or towards the batsman. If the ball moves away from the batsman it is called an out-swinger; if the ball moves towards the batsman it is called the in-swinger.On to the seamThe cricket ball swings because of its shape and shine. If you look at a cricket ball carefully, you will see a narrow strip at the centre, which is considerably raised. This is called the seam. Actually, a cricket ball is made of two pieces of leather, which are stitched together along the seam.Seam + shine + wind = swingHave you ever noticed that bowlers keep rubbing and polishing one side of the ball? This is done to maintain the shine of the ball on one side and keep the other side rough. This is the key to the swing of the ball.The side that has the shine provides little resistance to the wind, while the rough side resists the flow of the wind. The fast moving wind on the shiny side hits the raised seam and pushes the ball in the opposite direction, thus making the ball swing.Out-swingers and in-swingersIf the shining side is kept on the left hand side while bowling to a right handed batsmen, you will get an In-swinger as the wind will push the ball into the batsmen. Similarly to get an Out-swinger, a bowler keeps the shining side on the right side while delivering.A twist in the tale: the reverse swingFrom time to time we have heard it being said that a particular cricketer can make the ball reverse swing? Whatever does that mean?The reverse swing is a method through which a ball can be made to be swing in the opposite direction. That is, with the action of an out-swinger you can achieve an in-swinger. But how is this possible, you would ask?Yes, this is where controversy steps in. Reverse swing can be achieved by tampering with the ball, i.e. raising the seam forcefully, or damaging the bowl intentionally so as to make the shining side heavier than the rough side. Ball tampering or damaging is not permitted by international cricketing rules and bowlers can be suspended for doing it.So the next time someone asks you about how a cricket ball swings, you’re sure to know the answer.","keyword":"[\"ball\", \"swing\", \"cricket\", \"batsman\", \"bowler\", \"shine\"]","ALS":"27.72222222222222"},{"english_id":"790","id":"791","level":"4","topic":"7","title":"Why does a Kentish Plover Parent Desert its Family?","article":"When couples exchange vows on the marriage day, they generally say ‘till death do us part’. For a species of shore-dwelling bird called the Kentish Plover, it is ‘till divorce do us part’.Indeed, birds of this species usually leave their partners after the incubation (hatching) of the eggs and usually it is the female who moves on, while the male stays on to look after the babies. A recent study conducted by Andras Kosztolanyi of the University of Debrecen, in Hungary, sheds light on the reason behind this behaviour.During his experiments, Kosztolanyi removed both the parents from the nest and found that when one of the parents was removed during incubation, the eggs generally failed to hatch.Adult Kentish Plover Water BirdOnce the eggs are hatched, however, a single parent is as good at tending the young ones as both do together. This means if one parent deserts after the eggs have hatched, it would cause little problems. But, why would a bird desert its own nest?Kosztolanyi found out that they do this in order to raise another family. Whether a bird deserts or stays with the family depends on whether it can build another nest or not. This means that the birds may actually build two or more nests in a single season. And the act of deserting one nest and moving on to another is simply an intelligent decision to keep up the population.However, divorce, or rather separation, seems to be a very delicate decision. A bird decides to leave only after it has weighed all the pros and cons. First, it has to make sure that the other parent will not abandon the nest as well. Secondly, it has to be sure of finding another mate.The scientists have also found that, often, it is the female who abandons her mate and off-spring. This may be related to the fact that the number of males outnumber the females. It was also discovered that the rate of divorces decline towards the end of the Plover breeding season. This may be due to the fact that by the end of the season, there is hardly any time left to build another nest, so it makes sense to concentrate on raising the existing young ones.","keyword":"[\"nest\", \"plover\", \"divorce\", \"kosztolanyi\", \"bird\", \"desert\"]","ALS":"29.785714285714285"},{"english_id":"791","id":"792","level":"4","topic":"14","title":"Why does the Sun follow You?","article":"Have you ever noticed that when you are in a car, or a bus, travelling on a straight road, the Sun appears to move right along with you?While telephone poles and trees close to the road, whiz past in the blink of an eye, the Sun is always visible throughout the journey. No matter how fast Daddy drives, you just cannot leave the Sun behind.Strangely enough, the trees nearer the road disappear from your range of vision more quickly than the trees further off. Why is this so?Our eyes have a certain ‘range’ of vision. You can see things only within that range. For instance, you cannot see objects behind your head. This field of vision widens out from the point where you are. Objects further away are visible for a longer period, even as your car whizzes by.Why does the Sun follow You?Field of visionTo understand what the range of vision is, draw a triangle as in the picture and name the corners A, B and C, such that the distance between A and B is equal to the distance between A and C. The point A indicates your position. Now draw a line DE in the triangle, parallel to BC, such that ADE forms a smaller triangle ‘within’ ABC.Look at the triangle. You will see that BC is longer than DE. This means that your field of vision at any point on the line BC is wider than what you can see on any point on the line DE. This means that your line of vision widens as the distance from your eyes (point A) increases.As a result, objects further away from you stay longer in your field of vision since the range is larger than nearby objects. And very distant objects appear to be in the same position for a long time.The Sun is 149,597,870 kilometres away from the Earth. That is a huge distance, so it seems to stay in the same place, in relation to your car, no matter how fast you travel.The only thing that travels fast enough to make the Sun appear to move in the sky is the Earth itself. If you consider a point on the equator, the Earth rotates on its axis at a speed slightly more than 1,600 kilometres per hour.The equator is an imaginary circle on the surface of the Earth which is at a equal distance from the poles and divides the Earth into two parts – the northern and southern hemispheres.However, the Earth is huge, and despite rotating at such an incredible speed, it takes 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds to complete one full rotation.On an average, the Earth takes 24 hours to make one complete rotation and as it moves on its axis, the Sun appears to move along the horizon – rising from the East, moving overhead and finally setting on the West.

Surprisingly enough, the pots are exposed to blazing sunlight, yet the water within stays so cool. How is that possible?This is because of a physical process known as evaporation. When a liquid changes to a gaseous (or vapour) state without boiling, it is known as evaporation.A matka is made of mud and has many minute pores (extremely small holes). No matter how tightly you pack the mud, these pores remain. It is through these pores that the water, placed inside the matka, oozes out. Now, to evaporate, the water needs to absorb heat, which will change it to vapour.The only way the water oozing out of the matka can turn to vapour is by absorbing heat from the liquid within the matka and the matka itself. Due to this process of continuous absorption of heat from the water inside the matka, in a few hours, this water becomes cool.Why Does Water stay Cool in ‘Matkas’ (earthen clay pots)?Glass and metal do not have any pores. So the water placed inside glass and metal vessels cannot seep out and evaporate. Therefore, the water inside remains hot.Evaporation: nature’s air-conditionerIn nature, there are countless examples of evaporation. For instance, have you ever noticed how a dog hangs its tongue out after running around? The saliva on its tongue evaporates and the tongue becomes cooler. In turn, the dog also feels cooler.Why do we feel cool under a fan? This is because the sweat, that is oozing out of the pores in our skin, evaporates in the fan’s breeze. The heat needed for the sweat to evaporate is absorbed from the object it comes in contact with (our body) and so we feel cooler.You know, an adult marching through a desert may sweat up to 10 litres of water a day! A person may lose a lot of body salt through the sweat if he perspires too much. This can result in painful cramps, especially if he drinks water without adding salt to it.That is why you must remember to drink lots and lots of water before going out on a hot afternoon.","keyword":"[\"matka\", \"pore\", \"evaporate\", \"ooze\", \"sweat\", \"water\"]","ALS":"25.058823529411764"},{"english_id":"794","id":"795","level":"4","topic":"1","title":"Why don't Birds on a wire get a shock?","article":"Now how is that possible? The fact is, for a living creature to get a ‘shock’ there has to be a substantial flow of current through the body. However, there is barely any current running through the bird’s body for two reasons. Firstly, the bird not only forms a circuit with the wire, but it also offers a high resistance to current, so the current passes through the wire instead of the bird.It’s a bit like this, would you prefer going on a smooth road or a road full of potholes? The answer is obvious and just like you, the current prefers taking the easier path. All objects offer some amount of resistance to the flow of current, depending on the material.Why don’t Birds on a wire get a shock?This is just one of the reasons why birds don’t get shock, however the more important reason why current does not pass through the bird is, there is barely any, if at all, voltage difference across the bird. Current flow is actually just the flow of minute charged particles that are invisible to the naked eye. These charged particles need an energy input in order for them to get transferred. The amount of energy needed to move the charges from one point to another is measured in terms of the potential difference between the two points.A bird perched on high-tension wires has both its feet placed firmly on the same wire, so the net potential difference from one end of the bird to the other is, for all purposes, next to nil.In order for current to flow through the bird, there must be a sizeable difference in voltage across the body. While the potential difference between the wire and Earth may be thousands of volts, the potential difference between the bird’s two feet is extremely tiny and so a very small current flows through the bird which can barely be registered.If the bird were to touch the wire and simultaneously another wire, it would receive a mild shock. On the other hand if it were to touch the wire and some other object connected to the ground, it would receive a deadly shock, the greater the potential difference, the greater is the current flow.","keyword":"[\"wire\", \"bird\", \"shock\", \"difference\", \"flow\", \"charge\"]","ALS":"38.09090909090909"},{"english_id":"795","id":"796","level":"4","topic":"3","title":"Why is Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow?","article":"Here’s a quiz question: what is curly or straight and needs to be combed, brushed, plaited or twisted? It is gelled, shampooed, dyed, coloured black, blonde, white, red, brown and needs to be cut once in a while. A hint – the answer is above your head – it’s your hair!Each time you pass by a mirror, the one thing that strikes you is the hair on your head. Hair is something that grows by itself without any help. Well, actually, brushing and combing and even oiling it does help or else you tend to lose your hair.Though the most noticeable presence of hair is on the head, it grows all over the body – out of the ears, on the chest, upper lip, cheeks, arms and legs. The only place hair doesn’t grow hair is on the lips itself and on the inner palms of the hands and feet.Human hair in different colors and texturesBasically there are two types of hair – the thick, coarse hair on the head and face and the light fine hair on the arms and legs.Hair is a kind of a skin tissue that is hardened by a protein called keratin. Keratin is what covers the outer skin and that is why hair grows on all these places too.The hair cells constantly multiply under the skin. Each cell keeps dividing and creating more cells. The new cells push the old cells above the skin surface and that’s how hair grows.Of course, once the hair cells are out on the surface, they lose the ability to multiply. They become dead cells. And that is why hair acts as a protector.It protects the head by keeping it warm. This was a very important function in the early days when humans used to live in caves and had to face intense cold. The fact that they were very hairy protected them from the winter cold.Another function of hair is to protect the delicate parts such as eyes. Eyelashes, for instance, prevent dust from entering the eyes. Hair in animals also acts as a camouflage.Hair anatomyBeneath the skin, hair begins to grow inside a small tube called a follicle.As it grows, it pushes upwards through the skin. Blood vessels in the follicle feed the hair root and help it grow.In every hair follicle is an oil gland called the sebaceous gland. These oil glands provide shine and gloss to the hair.There are over 100,000 hairs on your head. If hair is not cut it can normally grow over to five feet and sometimes 10 feet or more. The reason we do not have such long hair is because it grows at a rate of only about half an inch in a month. Also, we shed 50 to 100 hairs every day while washing and combing.Hair comes in a variety of colours: blonde, brown, red, black, etc. This is due to a pigment called melanin that gives hair and skin its colour.The colour of hair depends on the parent’s genes and the amount of melanin present. The lighter someone’s hair, the less melanin he or she has.Hair care is very important. Rubbing hard or yanking hair while combing a tangle can cause hair to break. Dirty and unkempt hair also attracts lice.Shampooing hair and gelling hair keeps hair conditioned and gives it a wavy bounce. However, luxurious and shiny hair doesn’t come from conditioners or shampoo but from healthy food and nutrients.Hair sometimes turns grey. Sometimes young people have grey hair mixed with their dark hair. Heredity and old age are important factors attributed to graying hair.As we grow old, the middle layer of hair ceases to produce colour pigments normally distributed through the hair cells. Lack of colour pigments turn hair colour grey.Not for nothing is hair called the crowning glory. It frames a face and makes it attractive. People spend enormous amounts of money on wigs. The study of hairstyles and hair ornamentation down the ages, is a fascinating area of study. And, very often, one can spot old styles returning after a while.People from different cultures have different ideas of what makes for a beautiful hair and style, especially when it concerns women. For example, in India and many other Asian countries, long, black hair is supposed to the mark of beauty whereas in the West, blonde and shoulder length hair is considered most attractive.What kind of hair is thought attractive differs from culture to culture and according to the fashion of the day. These range from a “normal” crew cut to long plaited hair, attention catching dreadlocks or even the Mohawk style that has all the hair standing on end. The hairstyles of famous film stars have always influenced the fashions of the day.Among certain communities like the Sikhs, men and women are not allowed to cut their hair. The men wear a turban covering their hair. People put in beads, plait hair, perm it, dye it, leave it open or tie it all for a reason – to look appealing.That does not mean that a clean-shaven head is not attractive. While Samson might have lost all his powers after having his hair chopped off by Delilah, Hollywood actor Yul Brynner is a bold example of baldness.","keyword":"[\"hair\", \"cell\", \"blonde\", \"melanin\", \"head\", \"grow\"]","ALS":"25.710526315789473"},{"english_id":"796","id":"797","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"Why is Snow White?","article":"I am sure like my two kids, all of seven and three years, you too may find the cold in Delhi a bit too extreme. It is cold and clammy and some days it is foggy making it dangerous to drive. Some days I would like them to be adequately muffled up in warm winter clothing, while they feel quite comfortable running around in a sweater and shorts! But most days it was grumble, grumble, grumble!Last year I found my children complaining about the winter cold a bit too often. So I decided to take them out on a well-deserved winter holiday. The idea thrilled them but their faces fell when I told them that I intended to take them to hill station. A hill station in winters -I am sure they felt that I had gone senile quite early in life.Why is Snow White?However, I wanted them to see snow so that they would learn to appreciate the beauty of the cold crisp winter and the fresh air of the mountains. So we packed our bags and set off to Shimla, a hill station in the state of Himachal Pradesh.After a thoroughly enjoyable drive we reached Shimla. It was very cold and to add to all this it started raining. The next day too there was no sign of sun. Just when we were planning our next move it started raining again. Suddenly we could see tiny powdery white flakes falling from the sky. Soon the entire place was full of white snow. For the kids who were seeing snow for the first time, it was probably the most beautiful sight.They were fascinated with these cotton flakes of snow falling from the sky. When I explained to them that it was only frozen water, they immediately turned around and asked me, “if the ice in the fridge was colourless then why was snow white?”A snowflake is formed when water vapour in the air suddenly freezes. It turns from gas to solid without having any time to turn into liquid. The currents in the air make these crystals go up and down in the atmosphere. As the crystals do this, they begin to gather around tiny particles that are in the clouds. When a group of ice crystals is big enough, it floats down on the earth in the form of snowflake.The result is a six-rayed ice crystal of delicate quality. And it is the reflection of light from these surfaces that make the snow look white. While all the branches of a snowflake are always identical, the arrangement of these branches is different in each case.Though these snowflakes are crystals with six sides, no two snowflakes are exactly alike. But they can be classified into different types of crystals. The six-sided shape of the ice crystal is because of the shape and bonding of the water molecules. Basically there are six different types of snow crystals: needles, columns, plates, columns capped with plates, dendrites and stars.We can only think of the snow as being white, but there have actually been cases where coloured snow has fallen. There have been cases where blue, green black and even red snow has been seen! One famous case was even reported by the Charles Darwin. During one of his expeditions, he noticed that the hoofs of the mules were becoming stained red as they walked through the snow. The red snow was caused by the presence of certain tiny plants, called algae, which had been in the atmosphere when the snow formed.Needless to say, we stayed in Shimla two days longer than we had originally planned to – obviously the kids were not ready to leave! Now at least they do not grumble at the extreme cold but they have now taken acute interest in skis and skates and sledges and reindeer. . .","keyword":"[\"snow\", \"crystal\", \"grumble\", \"snowflake\", \"shimla\", \"cold\"]","ALS":"22.677419354838708"},{"english_id":"798","id":"799","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"Why is it Harder to Walk Uphill?","article":"Raju heard the familiar cry of the ice-cream seller reach his ears, clear as a bell, even from his fourth floor apartment.

The climbing upstairs bit was a pain though. It always was. He had barely gone one flight of stairs when his knees began to hurt, and he felt majorly out of breath.Why is it Harder to Walk Uphill?This fact never ceased to amaze Raju – why going up a flight of stairs in his building got him exhausted, but coming down the same flight of stairs was a cakewalk.Do you know why this happens?We know that the earth attracts everything towards its centre. This is due to its force of gravity. When we get away from the earth’s surface, we have to do more work to overcome the force of gravity.On the other hand when we come down from a height, the gravitational pull helps our movement. While going upstairs, Raju has to lift the weight of his body against the gravity and greater energy is required to do this than for walking downstairs.When Raju is climbing the stairs, his muscles have to do more work. For this the heart has to pump more blood to the cells and as a consequence lungs have to do more work to remove the carbon-di-oxide from the heart and replenish it with oxygen.A Himalayan sherpa porter carries a large load uphill along the Everest Base Camp in Nepal. R.M. Nunes \/ Shutterstock.comIt’s the same when we go uphill. The steeper the climb, the more is the work to be done. The more quickly we breathe as a result. In comparison to the energy required for walking on a horizontal plane, the total value of the extra energy needed for climbing is the weight of the body times the height we have to climb.If we climb a mountain through two different paths – one steep and the other less so, we would feel greater fatigue in case of the steeper one. When we come down a hill, very little energy is required because the body is carried down the slope due to earth’s gravitational pull. Our muscles do less work as a result and we do notfeel tired while descending.","keyword":"[\"stair\", \"raju\", \"climb\", \"uphill\", \"upstairs\", \"steeper\"]","ALS":"25.88888888888889"},{"english_id":"801","id":"802","level":"4","topic":"0","title":"Why is the Dead Sea dead?","article":"The Dead Sea is indeed a very scary name for a lake. It is called so because nothing lives in it. There are no sea weeds or plants, no fish either. This is because the Dead Sea is nearly six times as salty as the ocean.It also contains many other dissolved minerals, including magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and potassium chloride in large quantities. Whereas in fresh water, only minute quantities of these minerals are found. The high concentration of salt makes plant or animal life impossible.The oceans and seas combined cover nearly three-fourth of the Earth’s surface. These sources of water are unfit for drinking as they are salty.Why is the Dead Sea dead?Why is sea water salty?Many minerals like Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium and Silica are found on the surface of Earth. Every time it rains, tiny amounts of these minerals are carried into rivers, and ultimately to the seas, along with rainwater. The two most abundant elements in sea water are Sodium and Chlorine. These combine to form salt, making the sea (and ocean) water salty.Why is the Dead Sea saltier than other water bodies?The Dead Sea is actually a lake. It is 77 kilometres (48 miles) long and between 5 and 18 kilometres (3 and 11 miles) wide. It is situated between Jordan and Israel.The Jordan river and some small canals drain into it. But, unlike other seas or lakes, no river originates from the Dead Sea. As a result, the water depletes only by evaporation. In this process, only water evaporates, leaving the salt behind. The rate at which the Dead Sea loses water is far greater than the rate at which it gets replenished with rainfall. As a result, over a period of time, the water has become saltier.A very interesting fact about the Dead Sea is that you can never drown in it. In fact, you can float on the surface like a log of wood. Since the amount of dissolved minerals in the water is very high, the density of the water is also very high.For a body to float on water, it has to displace water equal to its own weight. This is the reason why a ship floats, but a steel ball sinks. Since the density of the water in the Dead Sea is very high, the amount of water which a body needs to displace in order to float is very low. So you can actually read a book while you are floating on its surface.Consider this, many years ago the Dead Sea was much larger and not quite as salty as it is today. Since then, evaporation has resulted in the loss of water, and the Dead Sea is much smaller and a whole lot saltier. In fact, the same logic applies to all the other seas and oceans, which have no outlets. They too are getting saltier each year.","keyword":"[\"dead\", \"salty\", \"mineral\", \"water\", \"chloride\", \"float\"]","ALS":"21.84"},{"english_id":"806","id":"807","level":"4","topic":"16","title":"Why's the Sun Red during Sunrise and Sunset?","article":"As day breaks, a reddish-white ball of light that we call the sun, rises. This red haze gives way to a golden-white sheen as the day advances and reappears when the sun sets in the evening. Does the sun really change colours, or does it only seem so? The explanation lies in-between.Light from the sun consists of three kinds of radiation – ultra-violet rays, visible light and infra-red rays. Unlike visible light, ultra-violet rays and infra-red rays cannot be seen.The visible light’s rays are white and consist of seven colours – violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red (known simply as VIBGYOR).The earth’s dust, gas and air particles scatter the sun’s light in different directions. Violet light has a peculiar property due to which it gets scattered the most. Red light gets scattered the least.The rising and setting sunWhy’s the Sun Red during Sunrise and Sunset?At sunrise the earth is rotating towards the sun. Similarly, during sunset, the earth is rotating away from the sun. During these times the sunlight has to travel at an angle and thus cover a longer distance through the atmosphere. It encounters more obstacles in its path. Most of the colours, like green and violet, get scattered before the light reaches the earth. Since red is scattered the least, it is this colour that we see as it reaches us.During noontime, the sun is directly overhead and it appears white. This is because the sunlight has to cover a much lesser distance through the atmosphere and it faces less obstacles. Hence, it escapes a great deal of scattering.In fact, if we were to calculate the distance the sun’s rays have to travel through the denser part of the atmosphere (roughly around 150 kms) to any point on earth, we would find that this journey of the rays is almost 50 times more at sunrise and sunset than at noon.","keyword":"[\"scatter\", \"sunset\", \"sunrise\", \"violet\", \"visible\", \"obstacle\"]","ALS":"26.214285714285715"},{"english_id":"807","id":"808","level":"4","topic":"4","title":"Your Mobile Phone Has a Bug","article":"When people talk of a virus these days, chances are that they are talking about computer viruses that have the power to wipe out all the valuable work they may have stored in their computers. Imagine, this virus has the power to make military systems, giant banks, airports, hospitals and traffic systems come to a halt!The softer the name of the virus, the deadlier it may get. Remember the recent Love Bug virus which created such trouble all over the world? It came as an ‘I Love You’ message and anyone who opened that love-filled e-mail, was caught in the virus trap.What does a computer virus do? It targets electronic objects that are programmed. The virus spreads through connections between these electronic devices. For virus spreading experts, e-mail is a favourite method of unleashing their destructive weapon.Your Mobile Phone Has a Bug: Illustration of a virus on a smartphoneBut scientists warn that this is not the worst that can happen. There is more. For people are also connected through phones. The next virus may actually target mobile phones, especially those that are programmed to do many tasks apart from just communicating. It would then be easy for a virus to infect those programmes and create major disorder.For example, these viruses may have the power to record your phone conversations and make others hear them. They could create problems with your electronic money accounts, or they could create a mountain of telephone bills for calls you never made. And that would be a disaster. A report on this was published in the ‘New Scientist’ recently.One way out would be to have simpler phones with not so many different functions. That way there would be fewer programmes for the virus to attack. But mobile phone manufacturers are in a fix. People no longer want an electronic item to perform just one task. They want more and more functions added on. That would mean more software programmes to make the mobile phone perform all those functions. And that means the possibility of more viruses.","keyword":"[\"virus\", \"phone\", \"electronic\", \"mobile\", \"program\", \"computer\"]","ALS":"18.95"},{"english_id":"832","id":"833","level":"4","topic":"10","title":"A Duck's -Tale","article":"Huang ran a poultry farm.

When he died, I was still young. He left behind a big wealth. However, I was an inexperienced thoughtless youth and spent all his wealth foolishly.\nI returned to my senses only after the loss of all the wealth. I decided to sail for the Persian Gulf with some merchandise. Our group sailed from one country to another, selling the goods. One day, when we were on board, we saw a beautiful small green island. Just to have some fun, we all got down on that green patch. We were hungry and so we decided to cook some food there. As soon as we lit the fire for cooking, we got a jerk. The island was trembling.  It was no island. It was the back of a huge animal, which got disturbed when the fire was lit on his back. We were terrified to realize the fact. Everyone jumped into the sea to save his life. Most of them boarded the ship. But a few were not so fortunate. Before they could climb up, the captain started the ship hurriedly leaving behind a few sailors who were still struggling in the sea for their life. I was one among those strugglers. Fortunately, I caught hold of a big floating piece of wood and started floating with it.\nI was being tossed by the frequent powerful sea waves. I kept on floating like this for a long time. At last, I was thrown on an island. I was dead tired and extremely hungry. But on the island, there was nothing to eat except for a few herbs. Due to the continuous struggle in the seawater, my limbs became stiff and refused to move. I somehow managed to crawl to get a few herbs. I ate them and quenched my thirst from a spring of the island.\nAs I walked further in this alien lace, I met a man. The man asked me for my whereabouts. I poured out my misfortune to him. The man felt pity to hear my sad story. He took me inside a cave. There were a number of men present. They were all slaves of the king of the island. Those men were kind. They served good food and wine to me and behaved well with me.\nLater on, they produced me infront of the king Mihrjan who was the ruler of the island. I narrated my tale of sufferings and hardship to the king. The king was noble and kind person. He sympathized with me and appointed me as an officer on the port.\nThe natives of this small island were called ‘Indians’. Soon, I became friendly with them. A number of small islands were there near this island. These islands were under the kingship of king Mihrjan. During my stay, I witnessed a number of conspicuous sights. The seawater around the islands contained huge and horrible fishes. A few were hundred times bigger than the largest ship. Once I saw a fish that had her head like a bull. There, I witnessed many unimaginable wonders.\nIn this small island kingdom, ships from different parts of the world visited its port regularly. Everyday I would ask the visiting sailors about my city Baghdad, but no one knew about my native place. I longed to go back home.\nOne day, when I was standing on the port, I saw a ship approaching the port. It was the same ship, which had sailed further after leaving me behind, struggling in the sea water. When the captain of the ship saw me, he was immensely surprised to find me alive. He and the other crewmembers hugged me with happiness. The captain handed over my goods to me, which was left on the ship.\nAmong my goods, I chose a few valuable items and presented those to the kind king. In return, the king also gave me much more expensive presents. The ship stayed on the island for a few days. Meanwhile, I did a fabulous business there with my goods and earned good money.\nAt the time of departure, I went to meet the king. I thanked the king for his kind gesture and all his favours extended. The king again gave me many valuable farewell gifts.

The Devil!” And their abandoned meal ended up in the four friends’ stomachs.\nLater, however, just as the donkey and his companions were dropping off to sleep, one of the bandits crept back to the now quiet house and went in to find out what had taken place. He opened the door, and with his pistol in his hand, he stepped trembling towards the fire. However, mistaking the glow of the cat’s eyes for burning coals, he thrust a candle between\nthem and instantly the furious cat sank its claws into the bandit’s face. The man fell backwards on to the dog, dropping his gun, which went off, and the animal’s sharp teeth sank into his leg. When the donkey saw the bandit’s figure at the door, he gave a tremendous kick, sending the man flying right through the doorway. The rooster greeted this feat with a grim crowing sound.\n“Run!” screamed the bandit. “Run! A horrible witch in there scratched my face, a demon bit me on the leg and a monster beat me with a stick! And . . .” But the other bandits were no longer listening, for they had taken to their heels and fled.\nAnd so the donkey, the dog, the cat and the rooster took over the house without any trouble and, with the booty left behind by the bandits, always had food on the table, and lived happy and contented for many years.","keyword":"[\"bandit\", \"donkey\", \"rooster\", \"bremen\", \"band\", \"braying\"]","ALS":"20.42105263157895"},{"english_id":"1334","id":"1334","level":"4","topic":"11","title":"The Naughty Little Girl","article":"Once upon a time there was a very naughty girl.
