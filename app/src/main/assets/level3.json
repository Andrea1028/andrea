This changed by the mid-1930s when Kleenex had the slogan “Don’t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket”. The Kleenex website says: “Since Kleenex tissues came on the market in 1924, it has been the No. 1 brand of facial tissue in the world and has become a genuine global icon.” Its new slogan is “It Feels Good To Feel”.

The aborigines, or the original inhabitants of Australia, needed an effective weapon to hunt animals and birds for food. When they looked around, their eyes rested on wood, which was so easily available. They made banana-shaped weapons of hard wood, with a curve on top and a flat bottom. That made each leg act like an aircraft wing.They held it from one end over their shoulders and threw it hard and straight with such force that even animals could be killed. Thus was the boomerang born.In time, the aboriginals discovered that this little stick could be quite exciting. For instance, they discovered that if thrown in a particular manner, the boomerang curved in flight, did some neat spins in the air and returned to the thrower. They also found out that a wooden piece shaped like a T or V curves in flight. What they needed to make sure was that each leg of the boomerang was curved on top and had a flat bottom.Throwing boomerangs, thus, became a sport with the aboriginals. That is the reason why the old hunting weapon has been transformed into a popular sport today.The length of a boomerang varies between 12 to 30 inches and weighs about 340 grams. It has been noticed that a returning boomerang thrown by an expert thrower can travel as fast as about 100 km per hour. It creates a circle almost 45 metres wide and completes almost 10 delicate spins and loops in the air, like airplanes performing difficult stunts at an air show. And then, the boomerang returns to the thrower.That is why the word boomerang in the English language is used to mean an action or statement that backfires.","keyword":"[\"boomerang\", \"weapon\", \"curve\", \"throw\", \"aboriginal\", \"flight\"]","ALS":"24.23076923076923"},{"english_id":"213","id":"214","level":"3","topic":"17","title":"Children's Pledge to On-line Safety","article":"We recommend that every child accessing the Internet should adhere to the following pledge:I promise to never give my name, address, phone number, school’s name, computer passwords or picture, to anyone on the Internet without my parents’ approval.I promise to tell a parent or teacher if I see any bad language or pictures on the Internet, or if anyone makes me feel nervous or uncomfortable.Children’s Pledge to On-line Safety []I promise to stay out of any chat rooms and websites not approved of by my parents.I promise not to meet face to face with someone I meet on the Internet without telling my parents first and getting their approval, and I promise that any approved meeting shall be in a public place with my parents present.I will talk with my parents so that we can set up rules for going online.

What is the clown doing with a huge ball that looks like the sun? And what is this — a man with the heads of two big-eyed cows in his hands? All of them look like they want to tell a story. Their story. And that’s exactly what they do, for they are all puppets. And when their master pulls the strings and speaks from behind the curtain, they sing and dance, play and fight, laugh and cry.Some days ago, puppet groups from all over India got together at the Indian capital of New Delhi for an exhibition and festival. When people entered the exhibition at the India International Centre, it was like entering a magic land of fairies, or the animal land of the Panchatantra. But some puppets also made you think of children who live a hard life on the street and work for a living.Puppets on a StringSeveral of them came from Rajasthan, where puppet making and puppet plays have been passed down from father to son for many generations. They are people from the Bhat community, and perform puppet shows in the same way as their grandfathers or their grandfathers did. The Aakar Puppet Group was one such group (Aakar means form or shape in Hindi).But there were other puppet groups which have been formed by artists who have not learnt puppetry as a part of their family profession. Like the Ishara group of the famous artist, Dadi Pudumjee.In the evenings, puppet plays were held in the garden with magical lights and shadows. And children and adults watched with open mouths as fairies danced in the air and tall giants walked the earth. There were several plays that were especially for children.One such play was ‘The Flowering Tree’. It was the story of a poor village girl who gets magical powers. She turns herself into a tree which bears the most beautiful and fragrant flowers in the kingdom. ‘Mila and the Clock’ was the story of a 12-year-old girl who likes machines and not dolls. And ‘Lal Kaleen’ (Red Carpet), was a story of street children who have to work for a living and are treated like animals by their employers.Some groups like the Aakar group presented a show on how puppets were first made. They told a story of why their shows are not so popular with Indians in today’s television age, while they have received praise in foreign countries for their performances.","keyword":"[\"puppet\", \"aakar\", \"fairy\", \"story\", \"play\", \"exhibition\"]","ALS":"24.526315789473685"},{"english_id":"244","id":"245","level":"3","topic":"18","title":"Script your own Cartoon or Movie","article":"Superman flies. Mowgli grins. A pig speaks and a dog identifies a thief. Children live in the land of toys and ice creams. You must have seen one or the other in cartoons or movies.So how does it all happen? How does it start?Well, it starts like most things do — with an idea.A person, or a group of persons, may have an idea.Then they work upon that idea and create a story around it. A story may be something that one narrates or reads. But you need to do something more if you want to see this story in moving images — on stage or on screen.Then they go step by step with the story. The development of the story into ‘action and words’ or ‘moving images’, from beginning to end, is called a script.Now think of the characters of the story. No, do not think about the actors who are going to play the roles. Think about the characters of the story. Where they live, how they behave and talk, who they meet, how they look — all these must be described in the script.So, the script answers some very basic questions:What is the story about? (The subject)When did the events in the story take place? (The time: past, present or future)Where is the story based? (Country, city\/town\/village, rich house\/poor house)Who are the people in the story? (The characters)How do they behave? (Action and words, or dialogues)Why do they behave as they do? (Background of characters, their circumstances, their dreams and desires)These questions when answered or described in a steady progression of the story form a script.Now try your hand at writing a script. Choose your favourite film or cartoon and describe everything that you see or hear in it in great detail. Remember, you should not just describe the words and actions of the characters (for example, “Rajesh picked up his little sister in his arms and said ‘I love you’”) but also the colour of their clothes, the kind of house they live in, the view from their window, the season, the time of the day.

The telegram is still there but many of us have forgotten about it.Now travel back in time to France, 206 years ago, when there was none of your latest technology. Not even the telegraph. But people still felt the need to send long distance messages.Signals of the Past []It was then that a Frenchman called Chappe invented a code for the alphabet. It was called the semaphore. It was a code in which different positions of the human arm stood for a particular alphabet. Thus, there were 26 positions. People sent messages in this way by holding a flag in each hand to make sure that the positions were seen clearly, and a correct message was sent.Later, an instrument with two mechanical arms was also used to send messages. The instrument was named semaphore after the code. It is used at sea to this day.Then, it was the turn of the semaphore to be used for railway signals. It was used as a railway signal for the first time 159 years ago, in 1841. A signal arm in a horizontal position indicated that the driver must stop. A halfway down signal told the driver to move carefully till the next signal. A signal straight upwards told the driver that the way was all clear. The signals were painted red.The semaphore was a great advancement on the early railway signals. A ball and a cloth kite was used for the purpose. A kite taken to the top of a pole meant danger. A ball on top of the pole meant a go-ahead signal.With the invention of electricity, the railway signals also got electrified. A red light meant ‘stop’, amber meant ‘be careful’ and green meant ‘go’. This became the code everywhere.","keyword":"[\"signal\", \"code\", \"semaphore\", \"railway\", \"position\", \"driver\"]","ALS":"15.521739130434783"},{"english_id":"261","id":"262","level":"3","topic":"14","title":"The Girl who Squeezed a Peacock","article":"Last year, a strange thing happened at a zoo in Beijing, China’s capital. When the day started, no one had any idea of what would happen some time later. As usual, there were many visitors to the zoo, especially children.All of a sudden, a six-year-old girl caught hold of a peacock and squeezed it hard. She said she would free the bird only if her mother agreed to buy a Barbie doll for her. Her mother, who wanted the bird to remain alive, said yes. A Chinese journalist called Wen Chihua wrote about this in a newspaper called Terra Viva.Why did the girl do such a thing? Well, there are many who feel that very often Chinese children do not get to see nature in all its forms. Especially children living in cities, who do not realise the importance of living in tune with the environment. Most of them live in small matchbox- like houses with hardly any greenery around.Parents also get into another habit, when they take children to the zoo or to the aquaria. While showing an animal to the children, they talk about its value as a food item, rather than as an animal with many other roles in the environment.How would it be if we thought of fish chops and the proteins they contain, every time we saw a fish. Or, if the sight of a turtle made us think of turtle meat and how it could make us live longer! The Chinese believe that eating turtle meat could help them live longer.Some years back, a group of Japanese and Chinese children attended a summer camp. The difference between Chinese and Japanese children was very interesting. The Japanese children put up tents on their own while the Chinese children just watched along with their parents.When they went out on a nature walk, the children found some ostrich eggs. While the Japanese children made nests for the eggs and kept them carefully, the Chinese children did something very different. They liked to break the ostrich eggs.Why do they behave like this? This is a question many Chinese are asking today. But now they think they know what the problem is.One of the problems is that for about 25 years, Chinese governments have had a rule that every family must have only one child. They did this because they felt that China’s population was growing too fast. Families that had more than one child got less benefits when it came to getting government houses or jobs.So, most children grow up lonely and needing warmth. Even squeezing animals becomes a way of getting in touch with others around them. And since most of them do not ever come in contact with nature, they often become cruel to animals. Or they break things around them, and get involved in fights with other children. It is because they do not know better.As a result, adults have started thinking of the ways in which they can learn to think of nature and animals in a positive way, so that children too do the same.","keyword":"[\"chinese\", \"turtle\", \"child\", \"japanese\", \"squeeze\", \"nature\"]","ALS":"23.5"},{"english_id":"264","id":"265","level":"3","topic":"18","title":"The King Who Tested Babies","article":"Children are always asking questions, like ‘Why is the sky blue’, or ‘Why do we have only one nose’.

What if a child grew up in a place where there was no one to talk to? Would the baby learn to speak then? It was Akbar’s view that children learnt to speak by hearing people’s conversations.

Sometimes wet nurses were allowed to go in and be with the babies. Only those who were dumb, were chosen. The hostel got the name of ‘Gung Mahal’ (the palace of the dumb).

A street lamp shone dimly, creating pools of shadows along a tiny lane in Bareilly city. Sitting beneath the light was Imran. His nimble fingers were busy pasting thin sheets of coloured paper. He was making a kite.Even though he could barely see, he didn’t fumble in his work. He could make these kites blindfolded now. At 10, he was an old hand at the craft, having started making kites when he was just six years old – the kites that Bareilly, in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh, is so well known for.At first, Imran used to help his mother crush the glass that is used to make the ‘manjha’ or the thread used to fly the kite. To make the manjha strong, finely ground glass is mixed with glue and applied on the thread by hand.In the morning, along with seven other boys, Imran would apply the thick, sticky glue onto the manjha, which was tied across poles in a courtyard.The process was gruelling and risky. Since the glass was not often ground finely, it would leave deep cuts on the palms of the boys. But often there was no medicine to stop the bleeding. The wounds were wrapped up in dirty bandages and left to heal. All these young employees carried scars.But they couldn’t stop because that would mean losing a day’s wages.Unlike the other boys, Imran’s work didn’t end by nightfall. Late at night, after dinner, when everyone else had retired for the day, Imran sat under the lamppost and made kites.He didn’t mind the pain or the long, difficult hours. He knew his family depended on him and he couldn’t let them down. He had three younger brothers and a sister. His father suffered from tuberculosis and usually stayed home. His mother helped to crush glass but earned very little. It was not enough to feed the entire family.Over the last few days, work had suddenly become hectic. The kite-maker or ‘Ustad’ wanted hundreds of kites ready before Independence Day (August 15) when the skies are shot with colour. It is a day when children and adults of all sizes fly kites.The kites had to be sent to various cities and towns and there was little time to spare. The boys worked round the clock, often missing their meals.But now the kites were ready — red, blue, green, purple, burgundy and bright yellow. The yard where the kites were kept looked like a garden and Imran felt proud of his work. Although he couldn’t afford to buy any, he knew many others like him would fly his kites and so, the sky would be his.Sitting in a corner, his heart soared imagining the experience — little boys shouting gleefully as they cut each other’s kites, shouting ‘woh kaata’ (there! The kite is cut!). Their joy shone in his eyes.A hand on his shoulder brought him back from his dream to reality. It was the Ustad. His wrinkled face had an understanding look as if he knew what Imran was thinking. He thrust some notes at Imran, his extra earnings for the work he had put in these last few days.Overjoyed, Imran snatched the money and began to run across to his mother. It was time for celebrations. He knew his mother would have cooked special dishes for the family and he didn’t want to miss the feast.Suddenly, the ustad called out his name. For a moment, Imran was afraid he would take the money back. Fearfully he looked behind his shoulder. The Ustad was holding out a kite — red, yellow, purple! Happy Independence Day, he said.","keyword":"[\"imran\", \"kite\", \"ustad\", \"manjha\", \"glass\", \"crush\"]","ALS":"20.852941176470587"},{"english_id":"299","id":"300","level":"3","topic":"3","title":"Chinese New Year's Day","article":"Chinese New Year is the most important of the Chinese holidays.

There is a lot of research into just what kind of nap is best for us. We all know about the traditional cat-nap. We put our head down and have a little sleep during our lunch hour. But then there is the power-nap. This is a short sleep which ends just before we fall into deep sleep. It quickly refreshes you and stops you from feeling drowsy and groggy. Another variety is the caffeine nap. This is when you have a power nap after a cup of coffee. It takes about 20 minutes for the caffeine to take effect, so when you wake up you feel doubly energized. Whatever nap you take, you can rest assured it will be good for your health.\nSources: http:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/ and assorted sites.","keyword":"[\"sleep\", \"napping\", \"caffeine\", \"hour\", \"feel\", \"heart\"]","ALS":"14.904761904761905"},{"english_id":"385","id":"386","level":"3","topic":"11","title":"National Tooth Fairy Day","article":"February 28 is National Tooth Fairy Day. This day celebrates one of childhood’s make-believe visitors. Others include Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. The Tooth Fairy comes in the middle of the night after a child loses a milk tooth. Parents tell the child to put the tooth under his or her pillow and in the morning they will find some money from the Tooth Fairy. Of course, in reality, parents sneak into the room and replace the tooth with the cash. This part of growing up makes children worry a little less about losing a tooth. They are more excited about the Tooth Fairy’s visit and how much money she’ll leave. National Tooth Fairy Day is also a good day to make sure children understand the importance of brushing their teeth regularly.\n\nNo one knows the real origins of the Tooth Fairy. It started in Europe hundreds of years ago and spread around the world. There are different traditions in other countries for when a child’s tooth falls out. In Japan, children throw a lower baby tooth up onto the roof so the next tooth grows healthily upwards; an upper tooth goes under the house so the new adult tooth grows downwards. Korea and Vietnam have similar customs. In parts of India, children wrap their milk teeth in cotton and offer it to the sun. In many parts of Europe, a fairy mouse takes away the teeth. This may be because mice have strong teeth that never stop growing.

It used to be a part-time job for kids aged between 13 and 16. The requirement for Barney Flaherty was simple. He had to show that he could throw a newspaper across someone’s garden to reach the front door. This is a typical scene in the movies showing American suburban life. Times are changing and many adults now deliver newspaper from their cars. It has become too unsafe in many cities for children to be on the streets alone before 6.00 a.m. The money to be earned is also changing.

This is because they have compound eyes. Compound eyes are made up of lots of cone-shaped units packed close together.Excerpts FromAn insect has something else which we don’t. It has two antennae sticking out from the top of its head. Insects use their antennae to tell them about sound, touch, taste and smell.Now we almost have the complete insect; a body divided into three parts, compound eyes and two antennae. But we’ve left out something… the legs. Guess how many legs the insect has? Well, multiply two by three and you have the answer.The insect has six legs. Add two pairs of wings to the insects that fly and you have the complete picture.This is true of most but not all insects.Have you ever wondered how an insect walks? If I had six legs I’d probably get them all tangled up! Well most insects move three legs at a time. This means that they rest three legs on the ground, while they lift the other three. But which three do they move to keep their balance? They move the first and last of one side, plus the middle leg of the other side. Have you got that?Stranger still is the insect walking upside down on the ceiling. Don’t worry, it won’t fall on you. This is because the legs are tipped with claws by which the insect is able to hold onto any surface. What’s more under its claws it has a sticky pad which allows it to cling to any surface and even walk upside down on the ceiling.Last, but not least, did you know that insects taste partly through their mouths and sometimes also through their feet!Ears or No EarsI hope you’re all ears for what comes next, because it may surprise you to hear that only a few insects have ‘ears’. Among the insects that have hearing organs are the grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, cicadas and some moths. The short-horned grasshoppers, often called locusts have their hearing organs located on the side of their abdomens.The long-horned grasshoppers, katydids and crickets have their ears on their front legs.How do other insects hear? Most insects have some hair on their bodies and when these vibrate, they know that something is approaching. They also use their antennae to tell them about sound.Talking about sound, you must have heard the cheerful chirping of the grasshopper or the shrill song of the cricket. Neither of them sing like you and I do because they don’t have voices.They are clever musicians or fiddlers. Grasshoppers make music by drawing their hind legs like a bow against the edge of their wings, and the brown cricket, lying low on the ground, sings its song, by rubbing its two front wings together.If you locate this talented musician, you will find that it is a male. It sings to call the female.

Well, special as it looks, dew needs special conditions to form as well. When a warm and clear day is followed by a cool evening and night, which is clear (cloudless), dew is formed.How Does Dew Form?On a clear day, water evaporates from the warm ground into the atmosphere. When night falls, the ground radiates the day’s warmth into the skies. The ground becomes much cooler, causing the water vapour to condense. This condensed vapour is dew.On a cloudy night, the clouds send the heat back to the ground so the ground never gets cold enough for the dew to be formed.When the nights get colder, this dew gets transformed into frost.One may also wonder why dew does not get formed on the soil of the flower beds. The answer is that the plants in the bed keep the ground warm.So, unlike raindrops, dewdrops don’t fall from above.

It is actually made up of independent sheets of rocks called tectonic plates.The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century.These plates slide against each other, giving rise to physical changes in the earths topography. The places where these tectonic plates meet each other, are called fault lines.To understand what happens when two plates slide against each other, try out this experiment:Break a thick block of thermocol into half, and place the two pieces on a smooth table.Put the rough edges of the thermocol pieces together.First put a light pressure to push the two pieces together.Almost at the same time, push the thermocol under your right palm away from your body, and pull the other piece toward yourself. See how they stick?Keep pushing and pulling, increasing the pressure with each stroke. See the thermocol pieces give a sudden jerk – a little piece will fall from the crack (the fault).

To understand why this happens and why the satellite does not get pulled in and fall, we have to understand what forces do. A force will change the motion of an object; it might speed it up, slow it down or change its direction. For example, if you are running and someone pushes you from behind, you speed up (the force is in the direction of your motion). But if someone pushes you in the chest when you are running, you slow down (the force is in the opposite direction to your motion). If you are running and someone pushes you from the side, you move away from them, changing your direction. (the force is at right angles to the motion). This idea is calledNewton’s First Law.To make something move in a circle it must be moving and have a force that is always at right angles to the motion so that it constantly changes direction. This force is called the centripetal force.How do Satellites Stay Up?Imagine swinging a rock on a string around your head. The tension in the string pulls the rock round in a circle (this is the force at right angles to the motion). So the tension is the centripetal force. If we cut the string, the rock will continue in a straight line because there is no longer a force to change its direction. For a satellite, the centripetal force is the gravitational force, the pull of the earth. If we could switch gravity off, we would lose all our satellites as they move off in straight lines!Going back to the rock example, we need to put energy into keeping the rock moving because the rock is moving through air and is losing energy constantly because of air resistance. We don’t need to do this with satellites because they are moving through space where there is no air, so no air resistance acts on the satellites and they don’t slow down.Many people think there is a centrifugal force acting which pulls the satellite (or rock) outwards. This is not the case; there is no such thing as a centrifugal force. Imagine riding in the back seat of a car as it turns the corner.

It is about 0.13 to 0.63 inches long.Unlike many other insects who use their wings for this purpose, the backswimmers make use of their hind legs to paddle on their backs. Some of them have hair on their legs which help them to swim. It provides a larger surface area to push against the water.The hind legs of the bug function like the oars used by the boatmen. Therefore, at times, these bugs are called ‘Great-water Boatmen’ or just boat bugs. They are so smart that they swim on their hind legs and use their front legs to catch prey. They usually feed on small fish, tadpoles and small insects.The backswimmers can stay under water for about six hours, by holding air between the wings and the body.After they catch the prey, they use their sharp beaks to pierce its body and suck its juices. At times, the boat bugs even bite humans.The backswimmers can stay under water for about six hours, by holding air between the wings and the body.

A stem in disguise, that grows under the ground!Many plants are masters at adapting themselves to their surroundings. They can change their structure to suit their needs.Farmer holding harvested dirty potatoes in his hands.Just as we keep large vessels handy in the scorching summer to store water, plants deal with the problem in a smarter way. Their body parts have changed over a period of time so as to adjust to their surroundings. Thus, the potato plant has changed the shape and size of its stem to store food and water. And this storage is done under the ground where it is relatively cooler.A typical plant’s body is made of three basic parts – root, stem and leaf. The root is generally hidden as it is under the ground. The stem is the tall, woody part, which gives support to the plant. The leaves are the green, flat and thin structures that manufacture food. However, all plants do not follow this pattern of division. In some, these parts of the plant’s body look very different from this description.This kind of adaptation can be seen everywhere in the plant and animal kingdom. Take the onion, for example. It is actually a leaf, which has been modified to store food and water.Similarly, the spines of a berry plant are actually its leaves. They have changed into this shape to protect it from plant-eating animals.Cactus: king of adaptationThe cactus is an expert at adapting itself to its surroundings. It grows in dry and arid regions where there is very little rainfall. So it has converted its leaves into spines to protect it from animals. Its stem fulfills the two vital functions of storing water as well as manufacturing food.The plant world is full of strange and wonderful adaptations.

It may happen when we carve our names or draw a heart on a tree trunk by cutting away the bark of the tree with a knife. For, along with the bark we also cut away an important tissue called phloem. This tissue carries the food made by the leaves to the other parts of the tree.If you cut a circle around the tree by removing the bark, you end up strangling the tree. The food supply to the trunk and the roots below stops. The roots die.When the roots die, the tree loses its supply of minerals and water that it collects from the soil. If the leaves do not get enough water, they lose the ability to make food. The tree suffers more and dies.Sometimes, farmers cut a circle around the tree knowingly. It is called ringbarking.

This fact was discovered by a group of researchers of the University of Sussex who studied the elephants of Amboseli National Park in Kenya, the Telegraph newspaper reported.Elephants live in matriarchal families or families that are headed by the mothers. The oldest mother in the herd leads half a dozen other adult females and their children when they go looking for food. This is because the oldest female elephant is the one with the longest memory in the family. She can differentiate a friend from a foe more than anyone else.Long Memory of Female Elephants is Responsible for the Well Being of their FamiliesMales, on the other hand, do not form close bonds. They move out of their mothers’ herd in their teens. Then, they either live alone, or, in small bachelor groups.And since elephants live up to the ripe old age of 60, or more, it gives them enough experience to fall back on. The mother elephant uses her experience to identify the inviting calls from a particular herd and decide whether the family should respond to it.If it is a known voice, it is obviously a friend. If it is an unknown voice, she leads her family away. For, a stranger could also mean potential danger for the children in the herd.This way, the herd also saves time when it is finding matches for its females. It falls back upon the mother elephant’s knowledge about friendly herds in other places.The researchers found out that herds with leaders aged above 55 produced more calves per female than families with young leaders.This is why older elephants are very important for a herd’s survival. But, sadly, older elephants are always the first targets of hunters and poachers. Killing an old elephant not only upsets her family structure for years, but it also has an impact on the future of the herd.","keyword":"[\"elephant\", \"herd\", \"family\", \"memory\", \"female\", \"mother\"]","ALS":"29.53846153846154"},{"english_id":"580","id":"581","level":"3","topic":"2","title":"Looking at the World Upside Down","article":"Have you seen trapeze artists hanging upside down from bars in a circus?

Many never meet their fathers and some do not meet their mothers either. Some insects, fish, amphibians and reptiles hatch from fertilised eggs and face life on their own. And those animals who are raised by parents, are often reared by their mothers. But we found that there are some animal fathers who are great dads too.Catfish: A male sea catfish keeps the eggs of his young in his mouth until they are ready to hatch. He does not eat during this period, which may go several weeks.Cockroach: A father cockroach eats bird droppings to obtain precious nitrogen, which he carries back to feed his young.Duck: Most male ducks live as bachelors, but the ruddy duck of North America helps care for his young.Earthworms: Since earthworms have both male and female sex organs, every earthworm can be both a mother and a father. Animals that have both male and female organs are called hermaphrodites.Wolf: When the mother wolf gives birth, the father stands guard outside their den and brings food for the mother and pups. As they grow, he not only plays with them but also teaches them how to survive. Wolves continue to live together much as human families do.Frog: The male Darwin frog hatches his eggs in a pouch in his mouth. However, unlike the catfish, the existence of the pouch does not stop him from eating. Soon, the tadpoles lose their tails, become tiny frogs and jump out of his mouth!Monkey: There are small monkeys in South America called marmosets. Among these monkeys, the fathers take care of their babies from birth. When a marmoset is born, the father cleans it, keeps it safe and carries it to the mother only when it needs to be nursed. When the baby can eat solid food, it is the father who feeds the child.Penguin: A father emperor penguin bears the cold winds in the Antarctic for 60 days or more to protect his eggs, which he keeps on his feet, covered with a feathered flap. During this time, he does not eat a thing!The long-tailed Gentoo penguin incubates eggsMost father penguins lose about 25 pounds while they wait for their babies to hatch. Afterward, they feed the chicks a special liquid from their throats. The father penguin can go to eat and rest only after the mother comes to take charge.Rhea: Rheas are large South American birds and look like ostriches. Among rheas, it is always the father who takes care of the young. From the eggs to chicks, he feeds and protects them until they are old enough to survive on their own.Sand grouse: A father Namaqua sand grouse of Africa’s Kalahari Desert flies as far as 50 miles a day in order to soak himself in water so that his chicks can drink water from his feathers when he returns to his nest.Sea horse: The male sea horse has a pouch in which the mother lays her eggs. The father then looks after the eggs for about two months, until they hatch and leave the pouch. He continues to protect the young until they are able to live on their own.Siamese fighting fish: When the mother lays her eggs, the father catches them in his mouth, then drops them into a nest he has prepared.

They actually keep a nose out for fish that smell like outsiders and not like family. Then they get tough with them.The reason may be that they use smell to mark out their territory, the scientists feel. And so, when they get a very strong smell of outsiders, they feel threatened.The Scent of an EnemyHow did the scientists discover this? They brought up 44 salmon from two different families and kept them in several water tanks. All the water tanks had members of both families. In some tanks, water was let in and let out. In other tanks they kept circulating the same water. When that happened the fish scents also got stronger. For water gathers more and more of the scent with time.The results were very interesting. In the tanks where water was let in and let out, the fish did not get very strong smells of family or outsiders. But in the tanks where the same water was circulated again and again, the fish scents were much stronger. The salmon in these tanks could easily distinguish the smell of family from outsiders. They got nasty, their fins became erect, they attacked and bit the latter.Scientists feel this discovery will help people who raise wild fisheries. For, now they know that if they put salmon belonging to the same family in a fast flowing stream, they will not develop very strong bonds.

So much so that the tiny blades never get any frost on them.In contrast, grass in parks without trees to protect them are usually in white frosty disguise in winters. Why is that so?You would never believe it but that leafless tree acts like a heater to the grass below. It would not be so surprising if we knew that everything on this earth gives off heat or light energy in the form of waves.The energy of light travels in different kinds of waves in space. And while we can see some forms of light with our eyes, there are many other kinds, such as infra-red rays, ultraviolet rays or microwaves, that are not seen by the naked eye.A leafless tree acts as an invisible heater to the grass below.Whether we can see one kind of light and not another is dependent on two things – how many times does the wave rise and fall in a second, called frequency, and the distance between one rise and another, or one fall and another, or wavelength. The light, which we see, is made up of the colours of the rainbow. We cannot see infra-red rays because it has a bigger wavelength than the colour red and that is the light that the tree gives off.Just as the tree with its infra-red rays gives heat to the grass, the grass does the same thing to the tree, and they both remain warm in winter. But in wide open areas though the grass gives off infra-red rays, there are no trees to catch that heat and return it to the grass. So the grass catches a chill and gets frost all over it.Had the human eye been able to see the different kinds of light energy that a tree gives out, it would have always seemed like it was lit up for Christmas!","keyword":"[\"grass\", \"tree\", \"frost\", \"leafless\", \"wavelength\", \"heater\"]","ALS":"37.7"},{"english_id":"658","id":"659","level":"3","topic":"0","title":"What are Dry Clouds?","article":"It is that time of the year when all of us look to the sky, waiting for the first drops of rain to fall on our faces.

Israeli scientists have discovered that air pollution may actually stop rain from falling.To know how pollution may prevent rain from falling, it is necessary to know how and when rain falls. The sun beats down on the earth and heats up the land and water.When the land and water have absorbed as much heat as they can, they throw the rest back, and that heats up the air. The air warms up and rises. It contains water vapour, or water in the form of gas.Clouds in a polluted cityAs the air rises, it becomes cooler. The water vapour hits particles of dust that are always present in the air. It condenses, or gets changed into a dense or thick form. It forms droplets. When these droplets become too big and heavy, they fall back to the earth as rain.Now, the smoke released by cars, trucks, buses, scooters and factories adds to the particles in the air around us. Because there are so many of these particles, many small droplets form, but they are not big enough to fall down as rain. These clouds are called dry clouds. Clouds that contain no rain.The Israeli scientists took many pictures of these dry clouds caused by air pollution. They showed water droplets half the size of those present in clean clouds.The only way to get back good rains is by cleaning up the environment.

As the train got closer, the sound of the whistle not only increased, it became shriller, and difficult to bear. So much so that I covered my ears in alarm!Once the excitement had passed, I discovered a secret – even with my eyes closed and by just hearing the whistle, I could tell whether a train was approaching or moving away.Doppler discovered that if any object giving out sound, is moving toward you, the frequency of the sound increases. That is why as the train gets closer, the sound of the whistle increases, it also became shriller.On a lazy day a couple of years later, as I threw a stone in a pond to see the ripples it created, an older cousin explained that voices or sounds of any kind, and even light, travelled in a similar manner – in waves.She named a scientist called Doppler, who discovered that if any object giving out sound and light, is moving toward you, the frequency of the sound or light waves increases. If it is moving away, the frequency of waves and thus, sound or light, decreases. The discovery was called the Doppler effect.Understanding the universe with Mr Doppler’s helpDoppler effect or Doppler shift is the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to its source.Then scientists tried to apply this phenomenon to the galaxies around our Milky Way, where the solar system is situated. They carefully measured the frequency of light coming from these galaxies and found the frequency of light decreasing, in the same way that I found the sound of the train whistle decreasing as it moved out of the station.This led the scientists to the thought that all the galaxies are speeding away from each other. So, if things are moving away from each other, they were surely together at one place at some point of time?The Big Bang and the expanding universeScientists claim that the entire universe was a small point in the past. A huge explosion called the ‘Big Bang’ created every known (and unknown) substance in the universe. The explosion caused the universe to expand. As the universe expanded it cooled down and created galaxies and stars. Slowly, planets were formed and among them, our solar system as well.So that was it!

Moreover, a book like The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a book that has been printed by several publishers. This makes the task of identifying a book very difficult.To overcome the problem of identifying books, publishers have came up with a unique numbering system. For instance, if 50,000 copies of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are printed by a publisher at one time (called an edition), all of them are identified by one number code. This number code is like your home address that cannot be shared by anyone else apart from your parents and siblings.Your address begins with your house number, street, locality, state and ends with a statement of the country where you live. An ISBN book number achieves a similar aim of identifying and tracing a book.What is an ISBN number?ISBN: a book’s addressIf you pick up any book, turn it around you will see a number which looks something like this – ISBN 90-70002-34-5. This is called the ISBN number. Do you know what this means?ISBN stands for International Standard Book Numbering. It is a numbering system that is used to describe the book. The ISBN number is a 10 digit number, divided into four groups that are separated by a space or a hyphen.The first part of the ISBN identifies the country and is called the Group Identifier. The Group Identifier may consist of up to 5 digits. In the above example, 90 specifies the country.The second part is called the Publisher Prefix. The Publisher Prefix is used to identify the publisher of the book. The publisher prefix may contain up to seven digits. In the above example, 70002 specifies the publsiher.The third part of the ISBN identifies the title and the edition of the book and so is called the Title Identifier. A title identifier may consist of up to six digits. Book publishers often come out with newer and updated versions of earlier books. Since you can have the same book from the same publisher but with different editions, the Title Identifier helps to differentiate between them.The fourth and the final part of the ISBN is called the Check digit. It is a single digit (from 0 to 9) that is used to check whether the given ISBN number is correct or wrong. Since all ISBN numbers are allocated by the respective countries’ ISBN agency, no two books can have the same ISBN number.The check digit is used to check whether an ISBN number is incorrect. If it is, this means that the book is a duplicate or a version printed illegally.The ISBN numbering systems helps book stores and book publishers to handle, categorise, store and identify books easily.","keyword":"[\"isbn\", \"publisher\", \"book\", \"digit\", \"identifier\", \"identify\"]","ALS":"24.523809523809526"},{"english_id":"743","id":"744","level":"3","topic":"9","title":"Why Do Horses Need Shoes?","article":"Clip-clop, clip-clop goes a horse on the road.

They may be blue, blue-green, yellow, spotted, blotched or white. No egg looks identical. Even those eggs that are laid in a clutch or at one time may have different colours. Most eggs are oval, and sometimes they are long and elongated. One end is slightly larger and heavier while the other end is smaller and conical.The shape of the egg has an important use. It protects the chick inside, until it is time for it to break out of its shell. For, even if you press from the outside, the shell will not break unless the chick inside presses too. The chick does it by tapping from inside with its soft beak when it is ready to face the world.How does the chick come out? Baby birds in fact have an ‘egg tooth’. This is a tiny knob at the tip of the beak to help them break out of the shell. It takes a chick 30 minutes to an hour to break the shell. Some albatross chicks have been known to take five to six days to break out as the shell is so thick!Most nests are shaped like a large bowl – the right shape for oval eggs to rest without rolling out and falling down. Birds that don’t build elaborate nests, like the penguin, the tern and other sea birds, have elongated eggs.Since these birds lay eggs on rocky ledges or on cliffs, the elongated shapes prevent the eggs from rolling over and breaking on the rocks. Instead they just spin around.Eggs must be kept warm in order to hatch – about 35 degree centigrade (That is about as warm as an early summer day in northern India). The adult bird provides constant warmth by sitting on the eggs or incubating them. Not only that, the bird keeps turning the eggs around so that all parts of the egg receive the same amount of warmth.Among most kinds of birds it is the female that incubates the eggs, but in some species it is the adult male which does the hatching. The only bird that doesn’t hatch its own chicks is the cuckoo.The bird is so cunning that it lays its eggs in other smaller bird’s nest. Since the eggs look similar the mother bird doesn’t realise that it is not hers and sits and hatches the cuckoo’s eggs too!The ostrich lays the largest and heaviest eggs. Each egg weighs around 1.7 kg (3.7 lb) and will not break even if a man weighing 120 kg stands on it. That is how hard the egg is. In fact the eggs are so large that the people living in the Kalahari desert in West Africa use them as a water-bottle!","keyword":"[\"chick\", \"bird\", \"break\", \"shell\", \"oval\", \"elongate\"]","ALS":"24.166666666666668"},{"english_id":"762","id":"763","level":"3","topic":"2","title":"Why do Ants walk in a Line?","article":"When I woke up one summer morning, I noticed a string of dashes on my bedroom wall. The line ran from the ceiling to the wall behind my bed and then disappeared under it.As I watched, I saw one of the dashes move. It was a small red ant walking up the line. Soon, another one followed and then another, till it grew into an army of ants marching up the wall.I noticed that while walking in a line the ants were cleaning the wall paint underneath them and, in the process, making a path. And there is a very good reason for them walking in a line.Why do ants walk in a line?Ants are social insects. They live in big colonies and have a very organised social life. Red ants make their nests inside the walls of our houses. They generally travel large distances in search for food. In absence of any maps or navigation aids, they have to rely on other mechanisms to find their way around.Scenting their wayAs they walk the ants leave behind a scent that they use to trace their way back to their nests just as in the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel, the children left a trail of pebbles to find their way home from the jungle. The scent that the ants leave behind is called pheromone. The ants walk in a line because they follow the scent left behind by the leader.If you want to test out this fact, use an eraser and rub it across the path that the ants are taking. The ants will stop precisely at the point where you have rubbed off the smell with the eraser. Directionless, they move in all directions.So the next time you see a single ant crawling chaotically on the floor, you know what it is looking for.","keyword":"[\"walk\", \"scent\", \"wall\", \"dash\", \"eraser\", \"social\"]","ALS":"25.46153846153846"},{"english_id":"767","id":"768","level":"3","topic":"2","title":"Why do Dogs and Cats Eat Grass?","article":"Cats and dogs sometimes eat grass or leaves. Have you ever wondered why these non-vegetarians should be interested in vegetarian food?A dog eating grassIt has been found that dogs and cats use certain kinds of grass and leaves as medicine. So, if you find your pet cat is nibbling grass, it might be ill.But, not always. It is possible that the cat has discovered some deficiency in its body. By eating grass, it is supplementing its regular diet with vitamins or minerals in the grass. Actually if you pay attention, you will notice that the cat does not eat grass the same way as it normally eats food. It keeps sniffing at different leaves and blades of grass as if it were hunting for something. And the animal begins eating only after it has found the right one. This means that it instinctively knows which is the right medicine.A very sick dog: Why do dogs and cats eat grass?","keyword":"[\"grass\", \"grassit\", \"deficiency\", \"instinctively\", \"supplement\", \"leaf\"]","ALS":"19.555555555555557"},{"english_id":"768","id":"769","level":"3","topic":"5","title":"Why do Ears Pop?","article":"Recently I went to the top of a skyscraper in a lift. After I had gone up a few stories, I felt a funny sensation in my ears. My eardrums seemed like they were growing and were about to burst. As I went a little higher, the sensation was worse. My fellow passengers in the lift told me to swallow a few times. This would help the sensation pass, they said. And, it did.This happens to a lot of people when they are flying, or skiing downhill at very high speeds, or going deep into a mine well.This feeling is what is known as the popping of the ears.But why do ears pop?In the atmosphere, the pressure of air decreases as we go higher. So when I was traveling up in the lift, the air pressure on my ears changed rapidly. But, the pressure of air inside my ear drum remained what the pressure was at the ground level. As I went up, the air inside my ear drum became higher than the air pressure outside. So my ears tried to reduce the pressure inside. In this effort, the air inside pressed against my ear drum, making me feel like my ear drums were going to burst.Similarly, if try to go down into a mine well, the pressure of air outside the ear will be higher than that of the air inside. Then the opposite will happen. The air outside will try to cave in my ear drums. And it will hurt me.The pressure inside the ear is maintained by a device called the Eustachian tube. This tube links the middle ear to the throat. There is a valve at the end of it which admits or releases air to equalise the pressures inside and out. But I’ll have to swallow in order to open it. The popping of my ears is the internal sign reminding me to swallow when I’m travelling up or down at a high speed.Popping is called barotrauma. It is one of those rare disorders which wears off with a few swallows or yawns.But not, if I have a heavy cold. Then my ears are in danger of suffering some damage because of the close links between the throat and the ears.","keyword":"[\"drum\", \"pressure\", \"swallow\", \"sensation\", \"inside\", \"lift\"]","ALS":"19.904761904761905"},{"english_id":"780","id":"781","level":"3","topic":"3","title":"Why do Woollens Get Holes?","article":"Most people think moths are responsible for eating up our woollen clothes, furs and rugs and making holes in them. This is because when we open these boxes in spring, a number of moths fly out. Don’t you believe it! Moths do not eat wool.It is the larvae (caterpillar) of certain moths that cause holes in our woollens. Caterpillars feed on wool, furs and other fabrics and damage them. But where do these caterpillars come from? The lifecycle of moths, butterflies and sawflies is in four stages – eggs, larva (caterpillar), pupa and adult.The female moth is a very smart insect. It lays thousands of eggs on rugs, furs and woolens or inside cupboards. Soon these eggs hatch into caterpillars. During this stage the caterpillar’s main function is to eat and grow. Caterpillars have strong biting jaws and chew up woollens easily.Caterpillars then make their cocoon in a variety of ways. The cocoon is a protective shell-like covering the caterpillar forms around itself before entering the next stage – the pupa stage. For example, the case-making moth makes a little tubular case out of the wool it eats and lines it with silk while the tapestry caterpillar makes a series of tunnels and lines them with silk. When it is ready to go into the pupa stage it goes into one of these tunnels until it is ready to come out as a moth.This is how our woollens and furs get those holes. To protect clothes against such damage one must ensure that it is free of eggs. Before packing woolens, furs or rugs for the summer, a good airing and brushing will help get rid of any eggs or moths. Clothes can be wrapped in heavy paper as moths cannot eat through paper.Caterpillars of certain moths feed on wool, furs and other fabrics and damage them.While mothballs do keep moths away, they do not kill eggs or larvae already present in clothes or cupboards. However, keeping these insects among your woolens could be fun if you are a lepidopterist (one who collects butterflies or moths as a hobby). Imagine the wonderful collection of insects you could grow right out of your clothes!","keyword":"[\"caterpillar\", \"moth\", \"woollen\", \"clothes\", \"stage\", \"woolen\"]","ALS":"21.36842105263158"},{"english_id":"784","id":"785","level":"3","topic":"16","title":"Why do we See a Face on the Moon","article":"When people say that they see a man’s face on the Moon, they are actually seeing the uneven surface on the Moon.

To answer this question we have to know a little more about the composition of milk.Milk and its compositionUnlike water, milk is not a simple liquid. It is a colloid and contains many substances in suspended form. These substances are mainly protein, sugar and fat. When milk is heated slowly, the proteins and fat get separated. Since they are lighter than the milk they collect on the surface in the form of a layer called cream.Why does Milk spill over when it Boils?Of water vapour and spilling milkMilk also has a large quantity of water in it. During heating some water gets converted into water vapour. The water vapour being lighter, rises up.As the upper layer of the milk is covered with cream, the vapour gets trapped below it. As the milk is heated further, the water vapour expands and thick foam is produced on top.Finally, the trapped vapour lifts the layer of cream up, quite like a hot air balloon, and finally bursts through this layer. As the vapour escapes, a lot of cream and milk spill out.How we can prevent milk from spillingIt is very easy to prevent milk from spilling. All one has to do is to provide a path for the vapour to escape. For this we can keep a long-handled spoon in the milk container so that water vapour is able to escape along the handle of the spoon. This prevents the vapour from getting trapped under the layer of cream and thus spilling over of milk.","keyword":"[\"milk\", \"vapour\", \"spill\", \"cream\", \"layer\", \"boil\"]","ALS":"22.615384615384617"},{"english_id":"814","id":"815","level":"3","topic":"11","title":"A Bad Dream","article":"Roderick was a small cat that lived in Mr. Geddes’s house.

The citizens of Hamelin were honest folk who lived contentedly in their Grey stone houses. The years went by, and the town grew very rich.\nThen one day, an extraordinary thing happened to disturb the peace.\nHamelin had always had rats, and a lot too. But they had never been a danger,\nfor the cats had always solved the rat problem in the usual way- by killing them. All at once, however, the rats began to multiply.\nIn the end, a black sea of rats swarmed over the whole town. First, they attacked the barns and storehouses, then, for lack of anything better, they gnawed the wood, cloth or anything at all. The one thing they didn’t eat was metal. The terrified citizens flocked to plead with the town councilors to free them from the plague of rats. But the council had, for a long time, been sitting in the Mayor’s room, trying to think of a plan.\n\n“What we need is an army of cats!”\nBut all the cats were dead.\n“We’ll put down poisoned food then . . .”\nBut most of the food was already gone and even poison did not stop the rats.\n“It just can’t be done without help!” said the Mayor sadly.\nJust then, while the citizens milled around outside, there was a loud knock at the door. “Who can that be?” the city fathers wondered uneasily, mindful of the angry crowds. They gingerly opened the\ndoor. And to their surprise, there stood a tall thin man dressed in brightly colored clothes, with a long feather in his hat, and waving a gold pipe at them.\n“I’ve freed other towns of beetles and bats,” the stranger announced, “and for a thousand florins, I’ll rid you of your rats!”\n“A thousand florins!” exclaimed the Mayor. “We’ll give you fifty thousand if you succeed!” At once the stranger hurried away, saying:\n“It’s late now, but at dawn tomorrow, there won’t be a rat left in Hamelin!”\n\nThe sun was still below the horizon, when the sound of a pipe wafted through the streets of Hamelin. The pied piper slowly made his way through the houses and behind him flocked the rats. Out they scampered from doors, windows and gutters, rats of every size, all after the piper. And as he played, the stranger marched down to the river and straight into the water, up to his middle. Behind him swarmed the rats and every one was drowned and swept away by the current.\nBy the time the sun was high in the sky, there was not a single rat in the town. There was even greater delight at the\ntown hall, until the piper tried to claim his payment.\n“Fifty thousand florins?” exclaimed the councilors,\n“Never…”\n” A thousand florins at least!” cried the pied piper angrily. But the Mayor broke in. “The rats are all dead now and they can never come back. So be grateful for fifty florins, or you’ll not get even that . . .”\nHis eyes flashing with rage, the pied piper pointed a threatening finger at the Mayor.\nYou’ll bitterly regret ever breaking your promise,” he said, and vanished.A shiver of fear ran through the councilors, but the Mayor shrugged and said excitedly: “We’ve saved fifty thousand florins!”\nThat night, freed from the nightmare of the rats, the citizens of Hamelin slept more soundly than ever. And when the strange sound of piping wafted through the streets at dawn, only the children heard it. Drawn as by magic, they hurried out of their homes. Again, the pied piper paced through the town, this time, it was children of all sizes that flocked at his\n\nheels to the sound of his strange piping.\nThe long procession soon left the town and made its way through the wood and across the forest till it reached the foot of a huge mountain. When the piper came to the dark rock, he played his pipe even louder still and a great door creaked open. Beyond lay a cave. In trooped the children behind the pied piper, and when the last child had gone into the darkness, the door creaked shut.\nA great landslide came down the mountain blocking the entrance to the cave forever. Only one little lame boy escaped this fate. It was he who told the\n\nanxious citizens, searching for their children, what had happened. And no matter what people did, the mountain never gave up its victims.\nMany years were to pass before the merry voices of other children would ring through the streets of Hamelin but the memory of the harsh lesson lingered in everyone’s heart and was passed down from father to son through the centuries.","keyword":"[\"piper\", \"hamelin\", \"town\", \"mayor\", \"citizen\", \"pied\"]","ALS":"20.25"},{"english_id":"1082","id":"1082","level":"3","topic":"17","title":"Pinky Selena","article":"Once upon a time there live there lived lovely princess Selena.

No one knew his name, even him! So everyone called him ‘What’s-My-Name’. He had the best spells in the kingdom. Now, there were three witches who were also living in the same kingdom. They were jealous of the wizard. No one came to them for spells because What’s-My-Name was very good at his work. So, the three jealous witches made a very powerful spell of the winds and blew him off to Neverland. What’s-My-Name wandered alone in Neverland for four days. At last he found a unicorn grazing in a meadow. It had a beautiful white coat and fluffy wings. When the unicorn heard What’s-My-Names’s story he promised to help him. He flew the wizard on his back and took him to his kingdom. What’s-My-Name chased the three witches, in the three different directions, north, south and the west. No one was sent to the east because that is where the good witch of the East lives. And that was the end of the three wicked witches.,","keyword":"[\"wizard\", \"witch\", \"neverland\", \"unicorn\", \"spell\", \"kingdom\"]","ALS":"13.0625"},{"english_id":"1482","id":"1482","level":"3","topic":"3","title":"Why Mynah Birds Have Golden Earrings","article":"If you look carefully at a mynah bird, you will feel that she is wearing beautiful golden earrings.
